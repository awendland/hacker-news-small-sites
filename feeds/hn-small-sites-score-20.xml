<p>Today at around 10:45pm CET, after a couple of glasses of red wine, we deleted the production database by accident 😨. Over 300.00 scoreboards and their associated data were vaporised in an instant.</p>

<p>Thankfully our database is a managed database from DigitalOcean, which means that DigitalOcean automatically do backups once a day. After 5 minutes of hand-wringing and panic, we took the website into maintenance mode and worked on restoring a backup. At around 11:15pm CET, 30 minutes after the disaster, we went back online, however 7 hours of scoreboard data was gone forever 😵.</p>

<p>To be precise, any scoreboards created or scores added on the 17th October 2020 between 15:47 CET and 23:21 CET have been lost. We are extremely sorry about this.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/disaster.jpg" alt="Blue green tennis"></p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>

<p>It’s tempting to blame the disaster on the couple of glasses of red wine. However, the function that wiped the database was written whilst sober. It’s a function that deletes the local database and creates all the required tables from scratch. This evening, whilst doing some late evening coding, the function connected to the production database and wiped it. Why? This is something we’re still trying to figure out.</p>

<p>Here is the code that caused the disaster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>database_model_create</span>():
    <span>"""Only works on localhost to prevent catastrophe"""</span>
    database <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_DATABASE
    user <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_USERNAME
    password <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_PASSWORD
    port <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>DevelopmentConfig<span>.</span>DB_PORT
    local_db <span>=</span> PostgresqlDatabase(database<span>=</span>database, user<span>=</span>user, password<span>=</span>password, host<span>=</span><span>'localhost'</span>, port<span>=</span>port)
    local_db<span>.</span>drop_tables([Game, Player, Round, Score, Order])
    local_db<span>.</span>create_tables([Game, Player, Round, Score, Order])
    <span>print</span>(<span>'Initialized the local database.'</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <code>host</code> is hardcoded to <code>localhost</code>. This means it should <strong>never connect to any machine other than the developer machine</strong>.  Also: <strong>of course</strong> we use different passwords and users for development and production. We’re too tired to figure it out right now.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learned-why-won-t-this-happen-again">What have we learned? Why won’t this happen again?</h2>

<p>We’ve learned that having a function that deletes your database is too dangerous to have lying around. The problem is, you can never really test the safety mechanisms properly, because testing it would mean pointing a gun at the production database.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that having a backup which allows a quick recovery is absolutely essential. Thanks DigitalOcean, for making this part reliable and simple.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that even a disaster can have some up-sides. This blog post generated a lot of interest. When life gives you citrus fruits, and so on.</p>

<p>The truth is, we can never be 100% sure that something like this won’t happen again. Computers are just too complex and there are days when the complexity gremlins win. However, we will figure out what went wrong and ensure that this <em>particular</em> error doesn’t happen again.</p>

<h2 id="some-perspective">Some perspective</h2>

<p>Thankfully nobody’s job is at risk due to this disaster. The founder is not going to fire the developer – because they are one and the same person.</p>

<p>Also, this webapp is just a side-project. It’s not the software that’s running a power-plant. Nonetheless, we have many users, some of them paying customers, and we try our very best to make them happy. Today we let those users down and that hurts.</p>

<p>The wonderful irony is that not 4 days earlier we tweeted a <em>hilarious</em> meme about deleting your production database:
</p><blockquote><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/mOlFqWal08">pic.twitter.com/mOlFqWal08</a></p>— Keepthescore.co (@keep_the_score) <a href="https://twitter.com/keep_the_score/status/1315552102299598851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2020</a></blockquote>



<p>Again, we are very sorry. Good night.</p>

<![CDATA[Themed days, Timeboxing and why you should use them]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever wondered how Elon Musk is running two billion-dollar companies at once? Musk is an interesting example of someone who manages his time so well that he can work 100 hours a week and still manage to take time out for his hobbies, family, and even Twitter! So, how does he do it?<br></p><p>Musk is known for using timeboxing methods to manage his time effectively. He uses timeboxing from the moment he wakes up in the morning where he assigns each time block to a certain task that he needs to accomplish on a given day. This timeboxing method can be used for any tasks ranging from writing emails, scheduling meetings, meditating or anything that you would like to do on a particular day.<br></p><p>Before I began using timeboxing, I learned about another technique called <strong>Themed days</strong>. I decided to combine both to maximize productivity. Themed days are <strong>strategically planned days in your calendar, which are entirely dedicated to one single thing or tasks from the same category</strong>. While timeboxing is <strong>to allocate a certain amount of time to a task in advance and then complete it within that time frame</strong>. The idea behind these two techniques is to eliminate context switching or minimize it.<br></p><p>How to use them? Very simple.<br></p><p>Make a list of 4-5 things you want to focus on this week. For example:</p><ol role="list"><li>☎️ Talk to 5 customers</li><li>💻️ Implement features X,Y &amp; Z</li><li>🎨 Redesign landing page</li><li>✍️ Write a blog post about productivity<br></li></ol><p>These are going to be your “themes”. Now open your calendar and assign a day for each one. Let’s say you want to work Monday and Tuesday on coding the missing features. Use Wednesday to interview customers, etc, you got the idea. (Tip: give each theme a color or an emoji 😉️)<br></p><p>Themed days could be super useful if you already have a day job and are trying to make time for your side hustle. Instead of trying to work on it one hour each day after your day job when you already feel exhausted, you dedicate a whole day for your side project.</p><p>With the one hour a day approach, the chance you could skip the scheduled hour is higher; <strong>with themed days, maintaining self-discipline is much easier.</strong></p><h2>Timeboxing</h2><p>To spice things up a little bit, you should use time timeboxing. Once you finished assigning themes and each day has one:</p><ol role="list"><li>Zoom in on each day</li><li>Add sub-tasks for that day’s theme</li><li>Add a time estimate to each task, and frame it with a start and end time.<br>‍<br></li></ol><p>You want to avoid any tasks without a clear deadline, even if the deadline is not accurate. According to Parkinson’s Law, if you have more time to finish a task, the overall time that you will take to finish the task will also expand. This holds true for many people and timeboxing greatly helps in dealing with that as well.<br></p><p>It’s important that as much as possible in Step 3 above, you avoid the <strong>mental optimistic bias</strong> of underestimating how long the completion of a task would require. When we’re too optimistic about how long a given task is going to take, we fail to completely follow through on what we set out to do.This bias, can be avoided by simply using a <strong>feedback loop, </strong>where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. At the end of each day or at least once a week, reflect on your progress and review the things you worked on that week and think to yourself how you could improve.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Timeboxing is amazing if you learn to do it effectively. In simple words, it is a process to merge your to-do list with your calendar. Another benefit of timeboxing is that it reduces the number of choices you’d have to make in any given moment — boosting your willpower for peak productivity.</p><h2>Productivity as an indie hacker</h2><p>To maximize your productivity, you must set your priorities straight. For me as a developer, I find myself investing the majority of my time coding, but as an indie hacker who wants to build a profitable business, I must focus on other stuff too; marketing, promoting, writing, and talking to customers. Themed days made me realize that <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/post/is-coding-a-procrastination-trap">coding could be a procrastination trap</a>.<br></p><p>Applying theme days helped me break out of the dev-hamster-wheel (aka coding) and forced me to do more of what needed to be done. So I decided to structure my themed days to look like this:<br></p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: Coding <br>‍<strong>Tuesday</strong>: Coding<strong><br>Wednesday</strong>: Writing / Learning<strong><br>Thursday</strong>: Coding&nbsp;<strong><br>Friday</strong>: Housekeeping / Reflecting&nbsp;<strong><br>Saturday</strong>: Marketing / SEO&nbsp;<strong><br>Sunday</strong>: Writing&nbsp;</p><p>As you see, I only code three days a week, so I can focus on other equally or sometimes even more important things.</p><p>I also found themed days to be very effective when it comes to dealing with new or unexpected tasks. Depending on the task’s "theme", I know precisely on which day it should be scheduled. It takes me a fraction of the time to add it to my system.<br></p><h2>Themed Inbox</h2><p>I took themed days an extra step and applied it to my Gmail inbox. With a <a href="https://www.axllent.org/docs/gmail-snooze-script/">super cool trick using Google Apps Script</a>, I have control over when emails hit my inbox. Instead of checking my email everyday and having dozens of unrelated emails, now emails show up in my inbox on the right day. For example, all unimportant emails are scheduled for Friday (my Housekeeping day), while all marketing &amp; SEO related emails come in on Saturday, and so on. This way I make sure I read the right email at the right time when I’m ready to act on it. So cool, right?<br></p><figure id="w-node-01d3452ce5a9-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8eb994e7219ad5c7a6_aacavebgfxMyaKY5fTJeYgq5iGSUGD-5kW-_E5b-80Oo0IdiLDzEmok9W3WkT5_U-_woBP59Bk2TJg2xCFos_w3fsecvjQiGpCcArpMwuSTAgkbBQkGZUL0fY1dDm_AIU3Vs5NiL.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The script automatically label emails</figcaption></figure><h2>Building a system: find a tool that works for you.</h2><p>When it comes to productivity in general, it’s important to have an efficient and flexible system that can adapt as your needs change without investing countless hours rebuilding everything from scratch.<br></p><p>Notion has been the core part of my system for the last five months. I’ve been experimenting a lot with different productivity techniques and approaches and it would have been so hard to do that without a super flexible and elegant tool like Notion. It's my second brain and where I store everything, so I’m using it to implement themed days, with Notion build-in templates.<br></p><p>I have a database where I have designed a template for each day and theme. Every morning, after preparing my coffee, I create a new page for that day using the proper template. The new page gets populated with everything I need to be as productive as possible on that day.<br></p><p>For example, on Saturday, which is a marketing/SEO day, I have a page with all the resources and reminders related to that subject.<br></p><figure id="w-node-5a939054f819-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8e51775d3896dd2ca8_IR7wRnLd7_xn6THm_98T9fff1sIPhOhPUMI39ZsvQZckACxBvIC6BGD4oOj2ke_tcSEynYyETcdgfdGl_6kFQibk_no8hh-5oawKs_-YBQTp8GeLS8dstn5kCNhbzySBkC7BNe7X.png" alt="my Notion templates"></p><figcaption>Notion template for each day of the week</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-fb4ef460147c-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f8b5b8e1cd4becfc1e46ca2_RaH23NZlbiaNZOdoL6Pg-aIbRYxrnuE3L3A2-ttTweWCPEe_vbzW6XUu0d-Ycspa372e7ZdciYXHQsFhw_3jadOX_Soqdvqd_ohmn1ikovesCXtAMPrdljxuWiv9Gt15cxeWtB9x.png" alt="Saturday template"></p><figcaption>Saturday's template, focus on marketing &amp;&nbsp;SEO</figcaption></figure><p>What I found really nice about this approach is that my templates are not static, and as I keep updating them, they keep evolving and improving.</p><h2>Next level: Themed weeks</h2><p>If you really want to level up your game and accelerate your progress even further, you can implement themed weeks.</p><p>One of my favourite indie makers, <a href="https://twitter.com/yongfook">Jon Yongfook</a>, has implemented themed weeks for his workflow. Jon works in a 2 weeks sprint, one week of coding, followed by one week of marking, and then wraps it up by writing a newsletter and changelog. When I asked him if he tried shorter sprints, he said that he did but found shorter sprints lead to too much context switching, and two weeks sprint works very well for him.<br></p><p>You can also use the same concept to devote the whole week to a single project, and really make huge advancements, or to a certain business function, and today, with all the rapid prototyping tools available, you could take a week to build an MVP/prototype and test your idea on the market.</p><h2>Give it a try and see for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>The best way to see what themed days can do for your productivity is merely trying it out. Here's your homework:</p><ul role="list"><li>Make a list of 3-4 categories/themes you want to focus on (e.g writing, coding, marketing)</li><li>Break them down to atomic tasks, ideally each sub-task should take one hour or less</li><li>Map each theme to a day of the week</li><li>If you can’t find time on working days, try to do it on a Saturday.</li><li>Open your calendar</li><li>Timebox the sub-tasks by scheduling them on their dedicated day</li><li>Get excited -message me to hold you accountable- and do it!&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>I promise that afterwards, you will feel a sense of achievement and see the progress that can</p><p>be made with this approach. It’s time to make room in your calendar for what matters!</p><p>‍<br></p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[How Substack Became Milquetoast]]>

<article>
    
    

    <div>
      <p>What follows is an <strong>unedited guest post by the author of <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/">Applied Divinity Studies</a></strong> about Substack. While I don't necessarily endorse everything said in the text that follows, I thought it was an interesting post and the author asked me to guest-post it here.</p>
<p>Some thoughts of my own as a prologue: </p>
<p>Looking at things I read in my RSS I notice first that indeed I look at <em>my RSS reader</em> (Feedly), and not at my mailbox. RSS is a civilized way of following updates from disparate sites you like, aggregating them in one central place that's separate from the mailbox where they can be saved to be read later, organized by source if need be. Newsletters —stuff that hits your inbox— strike me as barbaric. We solved the problem of centralization of consumption of diverse sources and then at some point there was some collective forgetting?? Maybe for a business that doesn't have a corporate blog a newsletter (With news about the sender) makes more sense, but blogs-via-RSS do not find a good replacement in the form of spammy inbox periodicals. One argument for newsletters is that it allows senders to track metrics about who reads their work, how much they read, etc. In Nintil for example while I have some Google Analytics metrics, I have zero information if you read it via RSS and not open the page; but I don't care, I don't even know off the top of my head how many people read Nintil every month; the reason I have Analytics is to tell me from where my blog is being cited, so I can follow the discussion about what I have written elsewhere. Nintil is not written for an audience I carefully cultivate. If you like Nintil you are free enjoy it (no paywalls here) and if you don't you can read something else. Because of that, I don't have a pressure to keep writing blogposts all the time, or feel the urge to squeeze a post out of the random daily occurrence just to be able to push the daily post. </p>
<p>But not every publication is a vehicle of self-expression. Monetized newsletters are there to make money. And that's fine. But paid content seems to fall into one of a few buckets: either politics (hooliganism ensures you'll pay) or businessy/financey pieces (Because reading may give you an edge somehow, or so you think). Who would pay (regularly!) for Nintil? If you like Nintil, you can donate via Patreon. Nintil is also the production of public goods (Like my Longevity FAQ; there I offer you months of research, for free, open to everyone), which is also incompatible with the paid model.</p>
<p>Do I read any substacks? I use <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">kill the newsletter</a> to convert newsletters into well behaved RSS feeds, and perusing my stash of feeds I can see Nadia Eghbal's and Anton Howes'. This will be no surprise given what I said above: My interests do not lie in operating businesses or following current events <sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup>, and that seems to be the bulk of what the Substacks are about. Not that I have tried particularly hard to scan their repertoire for something that I may like more.</p>
<p>
  [1]. You will have noticed that Nintil is an oasis in a desert of covidposting :)
</p>
<p>So by no means I can be a qualified critic of Substack; first because I am not that well aware of the various 'stacks, second because they seem to target an audience I am not part of. It would be as if I wrote beer (All beers taste equally awful to me) reviews; the problem would be me, not the various beers.</p>
<p>This all said, there is something to be said for being paid to write and it's good that there exist platforms that allow people interested in publishing under that model. I am not making a <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/markets-morals">Sandelian</a> critique here, I very much am a proponent of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Markets-without-Limits-Jason-Brennan/dp/0415737354">markets in everything</a>, but I also want this blog to be fully unpaywalled (I'm not selling you a product, after all), and I wish the same were true of other blogs (or newsletters); moreover I don't think paywalling content will lead to better quality <em>unless</em> the author is working full time on it. Is there a moral case for supererogatory open blogging? Probably.</p>
<p>Now, the guest post. Enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The style will often be strange, incorrect, overburdened, and loose, and almost always strong and bold. Writers will be more anxious to work quickly than to perfect details. Short works will be commoner than long books, wit than erudition, imagination than depth. There will be a rude and untutored vigor of thought with great variety and singular fecundity. Authors will strive to astonish more than to please, and to stir passions rather than to charm taste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (1835)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mathematics of churn are the best thing for niche artistic interests since the invention of patronage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Byrne Hobart, <a href="https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/understanding-netflix-5ab8f528f5b4">Understanding Netflix</a> (2017)</em></p>
<p>De Tocqueville’s indictment of American style is equal parts exoneration. If things have always been bad, we can hardly blame new media for the decline of society.</p>
<p>And yet, each time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpG11vFqglA">a new platform claims to be the exception to the rule</a>, it bears repeating, as many times as it takes, that this is not a good state of affairs.</p>
<p>I’ve rewritten this post three times, each more dogmatic than the last. So I’ve decided to forsake all the flashy rhetoric and just soberly explain the structural mechanics behind Substack’s relentlessly milquetoast taste.</p>
<h3 id="homogeneity-within-newsletters">Homogeneity Within Newsletters</h3>
<p>Top substack writers all have a clear focus. The Dispatch writes about politics, Matt Stoller writes about monopolies, Bill Bishop covers China.</p>
<p>Isn’t this normal? After all, no writer can be expected to cover every topic. In an age of disaggregation, we should read from experts instead of <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/28/polymath/">casual polymaths</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, the apparent normality obscures its historical peculiarity.</p>
<p>Consider SlateStarCodex, one of the most popular blogs in a pre-Substack era. It had posts ranging from <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/17/slightly-skew-systems-of-government/">political science fiction</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/15/the-vision-of-vilazodone-and-vortioxetine/">pharmacology</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/10/the-obligatory-gpt-3-post/">artificial intelligence</a>, to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/09/11/update-on-my-situation/">media economics</a>. That’s not a selective assortment, it’s his last few posts in chronological order.</p>
<p>(Or consider Nintil, which covers everything from <a href="https://nintil.com/longevity">longevity</a>, to <a href="https://nintil.com/better-science">meta-science</a>, to <a href="https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma">education</a> and <a href="https://nintil.com/pascals-mugging">decision theory</a>.)</p>
<p>Heterogeneity works for blogs since you grow through an occasional viral hit, and gain loyal readership through the occasional post that strikes a reader just right. As SlateStarCodex’s author <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3ygr2w/why_is_scott_alexander_sorta_popular/">describes his success</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granting the premises, maybe because I write a lot of stuff? There are about 500 SSC articles, one every couple of days. Even if I'm no better than anyone else, there are a lot more opportunities for people to stumble across the one that they like, be impressed, and start following me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is not merely homogeneity of topic, but homogeneity of substance. If you have to publish a newsletter every week, you don’t have the room or incentive to take risks.</p>
<p>In financial terms, blog posts have asymmetric returns with capped downside but unlimited upside. If you write a bad post it won’t get shared and no one will see it. If you write a great post and it goes viral, everyone on the internet thinks you’re a genius. Since content is shared organically, your best work gets way more exposure than your worst. The incentive in these situations is to ramp up variance and do the most interesting writing you can muster.</p>
<p>That dynamic is also good for readers. If a piece is bold but wrong, you can just close the tab. If it’s bold but right, you’ve hit a gold mine. Since readers can be massively diversified across authors, they can benefit from increased variance in the underlying assets while insulated from associated risk. In the Blogosphere, Twitterverse and even on Medium, readers could enjoy long tail upside without commensurate cost.</p>
<p>In contrast, every single edition of a newsletter is delivered to every single reader, and since a lot of it is paywalled, there’s little potential virality. This is aggravated by the one way valve on subscribers: one someone churns out, they’re unlikely to give you a second try. So the ensuing incentive is not to take any bold risks, avoid alienating readers, and write whatever will appeal to your current audience.</p>
<p>This might sound true for other newsletters, but not for yours. After all, you’re an interesting person, and you have interesting thoughts. More importantly, your readers are smart people who demand insight!</p>
<p>The problem is that like pop-music, pop-science and all other pop-culture, pop-writing can only appeal to the largest common denominator. Even if the author and readers are interesting people in isolation, aggregation forces this blob of individuals into a milquetoast morass. As David Foster Wallace <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qN9Z9UQWwsgC&amp;pg=PP35&amp;lpg=PP35&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cpeople+tend+to+be+extremely+similar+in+their+vulgar+and+prurient+and+dumb+interests+and+wildly+different+in+their+refined+and+aesthetic+and+noble+interests.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AjrMDxtfb7&amp;sig=ACfU3U3-gMCmnE9nVX7fjG_K2cDvjw4sVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjls7yHrJvsAhWxMn0KHYCQAj0Q6AEwA3oECAEQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cpeople%20tend%20to%20be%20extremely%20similar%20in%20their%20vulgar%20and%20prurient%20and%20dumb%20interests%20and%20wildly%20different%20in%20their%20refined%20and%20aesthetic%20and%20noble%20interests.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">once described it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is of course undeniable that television is an example of Low Art, the sort of art that has to please people in order to get their money ...this is a logical function of its need to attract and please Audience. And I'm not saying television is vulgar and dumb because the people who compose Audience are vulgar and dumb. Television is the way it is simply because people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests, and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests. It's all about syncretic diversity: neither medium nor Audience is faultable for quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="homogeneity-across-newsletters">Homogeneity Across Newsletters</h3>
<p>Still, homogeneity within newsletters might not sound like such a crime. If each person is an expert in their domain, a reader still has the option of reading broadly and getting a taste of each hermetic utopia.</p>
<p>Except that structural forces also ensure a homogeneity across newsletters, ensuring that you never read anything too original.</p>
<h4 id="global-ranking">Global Ranking</h4>
<p>Subcultures allow for an escape from status as a zero-sum game. If you’re the <a href="https://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2006/10/economics-of-status.html">king of your own world</a>, you don’t feel bad for being at the bottom of someone else’s social ladder (<a href="https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society#external-links">1</a>, <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">2</a>).

          <p><img src="https://iamevan.me/images/posts/Psychological-Safety-And-The-Only-Pyramid-Scheme-That-Works.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A lot of my job is about safety. Safety prevents errors from happening but, more importantly, when people feel safe, things become safer.</p>
<p>It’s a strange phenomenon that I’ve seen time and time again where if you lay out processes and tools that make things like software deployments safer, the effects continue to compound long after the change has happened. As people feel more and more secure in doing deployments, raising issues and speaking confidently in a company, the amount of failure goes down.</p>
<p>Conversely, the more <em>unsafe</em> an environment, the more failure compounds. When people feel ridiculed or judged for raising their hand to call out an error or a bug they <em>think</em> might be happening, they will raise their hand less and less. As people feel less confident about speaking out, more and more failure goes unmonitored until it’s too late.</p>
<p>Not to mention, people in safer environments are <em>happier</em>. Which environment would you rather work in: a technically brilliant project dictated by one or two people with no room for opinion or discussion; or a project outlined by a senior colleague who asked for feedback regularly and gave your opinion serious consideration and discussion even if it didn’t make it into the final product? A lot of feeling safe is about feeling valued.</p>
<h2 id="maslows-hierarchy-of-needs">Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs</h2>
<p><img src="https://iamevan.me/images/posts/psych_safety_Untitled-2020-10-14-1331.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’ve said the word “safety” a lot there but I should probably explain what that means. In terms of safety when it comes to the workplace, I subscribe to the idea of Maslow’s Hierarchy Of Needs - which I first learned about back in secondary school.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you have a pyramid of requirements, where fulfilling each level requires you have fulfilled the level below it, until eventually you’ve reached the top level of “self-actualisation” which is this idealised view of achieving one’s full potential.</p>
<p>In reality, things aren’t <em>as</em> cut and dry and you can certainly achieve certain levels without having its predecessor fully solidified or secure but it’s a good mental model of understanding what people <em>need</em>. In terms of what I want to talk about, self-actualisation can also be viewed as “feeling safe”.</p>
<p>The hierarchy breaks itself down into 3 categories and 5 levels. I’m going to tackle them top-down.</p>
<p>At the top, we have the end goal of reaching our full, happy potential which is it’s own category of <strong>Self-Fulfillment Needs</strong>. That is, these are the things that drive us, professionally or creatively, and give us satisfaction in life.</p>
<p>To reach self-fulfillment, you need to have your <strong>Psychological Needs</strong> met. <em>Esteem Needs</em> covers things like respect and prestige in life or just a general feeling of accomplishment. This can come from regular reviews, praise and a feeling of responsibility in your work. And to fulfil your esteem needs, you need to have your <em>Love &amp; Belonging Needs</em>. These come from intimate or close relationships (romantic or platonic) and are born out of a sense of community and togetherness.</p>
<p>To reach your psychological needs, you need to have your <strong>Basic</strong> <strong>Needs</strong> met. Personal <em>Safety Needs</em> are things like your home as well as security in your job or financial status. These are things that give you predictability for the foreseeable future. Finally, to achieve all of the above you have to meet your <em>Physical Needs</em>. Things like food, warmth, water and sleep. All those pesky things you need to keep track of to keep living.</p>
<p>Maslow’s Hierarchy is important here because, although it may not be your job to meet these needs, if someone doesn’t have these building blocks then they are not going to feel totally safe in their work. For example, if someone’s working on a rolling monthly contract, they might be more worried about “am I going to be let go this month” rather than “is this code ready to deploy right now” as they hit the big red button and scurry off to make a comforting meal.</p>
<p>If you are in charge of a company, it’s important to reduce as much cognitive load on your employees as possible. If someone is anxious about setting up a pension or worried about moving next month or is having issues with a colleague, those are all things that will distract them from their job. You should be looking for ways to help people feel safe and happy in their work. From a capitalist point of view: happy people are more productive and more productivity means more money. Investing in your employees’ wellbeing (with opt-in offers, don’t force anything on people) will probably be a net benefit for you for many reasons.</p>
<p>What’s important for us right now, though, is that people who feel safer, act safer, concentrate more as they make and deploy things, and reduce failure significantly.</p>
<h2 id="the-toyota-kata-and-the-andon-cord"><strong>The Toyota Kata And The Andon Cord</strong></h2>
<p>I love talking to new teams about the story of the Andon Cord in the Toyota manufacturing factories in the late 1900’s cause it’s such a great example of 1) how to treat failure positively; and 2) how to reduce failure by empowering people and making them feel safe.</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1990, Toyota’s factories added this physical rope, called the Andon Cord, that followed along the assembly line. If you pulled the cord, the manufacturing line would stop nearly immediately. Now, most people I’ve met start thinking that this is a safety switch - that in an emergency you can pull it to prevent harm - but it’s not!</p>
<p>Mike Rother authored a book called “Toyota Kata” which is where the West first learned about this concept (I think, don’t quote me on that) but what he says in that book is that the cord is a tool to install autonomic behaviour in the people on the assembly line. He called this “kata”. When someone pulled the cord , everything stopped and an “andon” (most commonly a flashing light) would light up above the workstation.</p>
<p>The team-lead for that section would then physically go to that station and see what the issue was. Toyota lives by a “Show Me” culture which aims to eliminate any of the bias related to the problem because both parties are present at the issue and can only work with the facts of what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Something very important to the psychological safety we’re discussing is that when the team-lead arrived, the first thing they always did was thank the team member for pulling the cord. This reinforced the feeling of safety; you were not judged for pulling the cord, it was <em>always</em> a good thing because it was <em>always a good thing</em> to prevent an issue or defect. You may have added time in the moment to the process but in the long-run, you were saving the company the money and time involved in processing the results of that defect.</p>
<p>No matter how small the issue or if the cord was tugged mistakenly, there were never any repercussions and it was always treated as a positive thing. Toyota, at their core, believed that failure created learning opportunities and that it wasn’t a negative thing.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://itrevolution.com/kata/">If you’d like to read more about the Toyota Kata, check out this great post by John Willis.</a></em></p>
<h2 id="making-failure-a-positive-experience"><strong>Making Failure A Positive Experience</strong></h2>
<p>The idea that we learn from failure is a tale as old as time but it’s a crucial part of psychological safety and my day-to-day job. Workplaces should feel <em>challenging</em> but not <em>threatening</em>. Modern teams' success often builds off the ability to take risks while still being vulnerable in front of our peers.</p>
<p>In Site Reliability Engineering, <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">being Blameless</a> is a core tenet of our approach to learning from failure. We try to instill a culture where every “mistake” is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the overall team/project/system.</p>
<p>When something negative happens, there needs to be conversations afterwards about what can be learned from it and what can be improved. The best results will come from a team that feels safe enough to talk frankly about their shortcomings, the shortcomings of the company and the reality of a situation. Think of a situation where you made a change that cost your company a couple thousand euro in sales - in a psychologically <em>un</em>safe environment, there’s no way you’d put your hand up to admit what happened for fear of being demoted or fired. And without a clear understanding of everything that happened, how could you possibly talk about fixing this in the future?</p>
<p>Making failure a positive experience is a culture shift and it happens gradually, not all at once. Regardless of your position in a team, start by admitting your own mistakes. When you fail, give clear signals that it’s okay to fail and it’s okay to call you out when other people see you making mistakes in real time.</p>
<p>It’s important to encourage risk-taking in your teammates and to make room for growth. Not every idea is golden because sometimes initiatives fail and projects don’t turn out the way you imagined. It’s a good idea to take a moment at the end of a milestone of a project and have an honest discussion about the good things, the bad things and the things that could be improved in the future.</p>
<p>It might sound counterintuitive but you need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. Being open and vulnerable will incur some level of discomfort with your peers, it’s inevitable. For example, you might be someone who likes control and relinquishing that control may make you uncomfortable, but giving others the space to try something new is the only way to figure out if that crazy idea is crazy enough that it just might work.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the discomfort in the moment but try to approach it as a collaborator, not as an adversary. You should all collectively work together towards understanding and volunteering for risk, so that when failure does happen, you have replaced <em>blame</em> with <em>curiosity</em>.</p>
<p>Creating psychological safety around failure encourages people to think about how things can be improved, rather than focusing on blame and how it happened.</p>

    <p>Serverless side rendering. What a buzz word salad.</p>

    <p>So what does it mean? Well, put simply, it means we render your website without the need for a server. This is not a new idea - and while we happen to use serverless technology to do it - this concept has been around in various (albeit somewhat hard-to-use) forms for years now. The idea is simple: take some HTML, JS, and CSS - and find a way represent what it might look like if someone loaded it in a regular web browser, so that web crawlers, robots, and most importantly, your users, see rich content as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>And of course - this is why we have Vercel, Netlify, Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt, and the slew of other hybrid or server-side generated solutions. All fantastic, but all come with one very important addendum: you have to build your project *their* way.</p>

					<p>My sister Sana just wanted to earn some money before returning to college. She was looking for a covid-friendly job on craigslist, something to cut down on the student loans she'd have to take out for the year. After searching and scrounging, Sana found someone who needed logistical help taking care of their pets. She applied and was excited to get hired.</p><p>First, they needed help buying pet food. They had ordered $1,800 worth of pet food (they bought high quality stuff in bulk apparently) but the seller would only accept payments via Zelle. Her employer was a bit old fashioned and didn't know how to use that service, so they offered a different arrangement: “I’ll mail you a check for $2,000” they said, “please deposit it in your own bank account, and then use $1,800 of it to Zelle the payment to the sellers. The remaining $200 is your fee.”</p><p>Sana was a bit suspicious, but she deposited the check into her Chase bank account and it cleared a few days later. Chase’s site showed that the money had been deposited successfully and was available to use, no strings attached. </p><p>Seemed like it was legit. So she did the honest thing and Zelle'd the money &nbsp;to the seller.</p><p>Happy with the job well done, her "employer" sent her another $2,000 check to deposit and transfer. This person really liked their pets. The same process happened again, and her employer was happy with the job well done.</p><p>Two weeks later, Sana’s debit card stopped working. Confused, she checked her account to see what was wrong. </p><p>Her heart sank. </p><p>Chase showed it as overdrawn.</p><p>By more than three thousand dollars.</p><p>The checks had bounced, two weeks after Chase’s site had indicated they had “cleared”. Before this whole thing had started, Sana had $300 in her bank account. Now she had negative $3,300.</p><p>She had just been scammed out of $3,600.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2><p>Turns out checks can bounce weeks after they're deposited. It can take that long for the bank to verify they’re legitimate.</p><p>Why does it take so long? Here’s a peek behind the scenes:</p><ol><li>You deposit your check, and it shows up as pending in your account.</li><li>Your bank sends the check to the check-writer’s bank to request the funds.</li><li>Their bank verifies if the check is legitimate and the account actually contains the funds. At small or international banks this step is often manual and could take <em>weeks</em>.</li><li>Their bank lets your bank know it's legit. That's when the check has "cleared".</li></ol><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 1600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/Check-lifecycle-large.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The life cycle of a check</figcaption></figure><p>I skipped one step though: </p><p>It take can than more than <strong>six months</strong> for a check to clear, but banks remove that “pending” status just a couple days after it's deposited and allow people to spend the money. This might sound a bit iffy, but it's actually a good thing. Most checks are legitimate and people might need the money quickly. But that assumption breaks down with fraudulent checks.</p><p>By removing the “pending” status before fully verifying the check’s legitimacy, Chase gave the illusion that the check had already cleared. <em>This is what the scammers count on.</em> &nbsp;</p><p>Today there is <em>no way</em> for a Chase customer to be sure that a check has fully cleared. But unless you have the inside scoop on how banks work, or a finely honed sense of when someone is trying to swindle you, you won’t catch it.</p><p>When Sana called up Chase, the bank heard her out. But instead of stopping the scammers, their only concern was making sure she pays up the remaining $3,000 that they claimed she owed them.</p><p><em>Edit: Chase customer support had one clarification to make. I'd originally said it might take weeks for the check to clear, but they explained it could actually take more than six months. And you'll have no idea when that magic moment occurs.</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/IMG_1399.jpg 828w" sizes="(min-width: 525px) 525px"></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="and-she-s-not-the-only-one-who-s-been-hit-by-this-scam-">And she's not the only one who's been hit by this scam.</h2><p>My friend David Vargas was caught by <a href="https://davidvargas.me/blog/i-got-scammed-out-of-5k/">pretty much the exact same scam</a>.

Of course not. Did they create an environment where scammers could thrive? Absolutely.</p><p>The harm was unintentional, but they played a hand in it. </p><p>Involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>What have other companies done when someone abused their products to deliberately cause harm? They took responsibility for it and fixed the problem at a systematic level.</p><p><strong>The Tylenol murders: </strong>In 1982, someone started <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/tylenol-murders-1982">spiking bottles of Tylenol</a> with poison, killing seven people. This was clearly not Tylenol’s fault, but they still immediately paid to recalled all bottles in the stores, offered anyone who had already purchased the pills free replacements. They took it a step further and <strong>developed tamper-proof packaging </strong>to prevent anyone from contaminating the medicine again in the future.</p><p><strong>Credit Card fraud services</strong>: Online payments are inherently risky. Credit card companies know this, and they’ve committed to helping their customers when the inevitable fraud occurs. If you pay someone with your Discover card and the product turns out to be a scam, <em>Discover will accept responsibility and refund you the money</em>, taking a loss if necessary. This dynamic keeps Discover on their toes working to prevent scams before they even happen.</p><h3 id="-2-how-should-they-fix-it">#2 How should they fix it?</h3><p>Make the status of the deposited check abundantly clear. This is how Chase can tamper-proof their bottles.</p><p>If a check has been deposited but not fully cleared, if it hasn't had the actual funds transferred over to the bank, then Chase needs to make that fact clear to customers! This missing piece of UX is what scammers depend on. That’s the systemic flaw here.</p><p>If the bank actually made the status of the funds clear to its customers, then it would have a much stronger leg to stand on when claiming innocence.</p><p>But as things stand right now, the only way a person could know the check was still at risk is if they already knew about the long clearing time and how banks hide it. Before the results come back from the external bank, Chase itself doesn’t know if the check is valid. Yet they offer customers no hint of that uncertainty.</p><p>And instead of taking responsibility, what did Chase actually do?</p><h3 id="chase-took-option-3-shakedown-their-customers">Chase took option #3: Shakedown their customers</h3><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/09/Ya340FffaeszEwIQ0ZPdxC9WQbRbN4kGKmcgTWiXLUiifzyqYvwzQSr4nwR3-jR--TS_Z-WrSDyVCcx4G37knBt171ds1zqYgfJ9hB4m-rUHKsDrCMG_N_2u6uTVCOreTRlc32iw.png 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Chase acted like the mafia, shaking down whoever they could to get their money back.</p><p>My sister had created this bank account back when she was in high school.

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been working on a side project recently, related to <a href="https://tabbydata.com/">this other blog</a> that I started a few weeks back. (The project isn’t ready to share quite yet, but you might be able to guess what I’m working on from those posts!)</p>

<p>Even though I’ve tried to become much more pragmatic in my technology choices over the years, side projects still end up being a great way to experiment with new, shiny things—or at least, new <em>to me</em>. (As a side note, this aspect of side projects—selecting the right stack and practice learning new technologies—is one of the two main reasons I believe in the controversial idea that engineers who program outside of work are generally better at it than those who do not. The other reason is that it demonstrates they actually enjoy using their superpower.) The latest new, shiny thing for me is AWS Cloud9.</p>

<h2 id="what-problem-does-it-solve">What problem does it solve?</h2>

<p>AWS Cloud9 allows developers to build software entirely within their browser. In doing so, it actually solves a few problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The local environment doesn’t matter anymore; Mac, PC, Chromebook, as long as it can run a modern browser you’re all set.</li>
  <li>The local environment is easily reproducible. If your laptop dies and you need to spin up a fresh development environment, or if you want to collaborate with others and need a fresh development environment for them, it’s one click away.</li>
  <li>Your Cloud9 instance can act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host">bastion host</a> to the rest of your infrastructure, and it’s as secure as your AWS console.</li>
</ul>

<p>That was all pretty appealing to me, so I dug in.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>As usual, Amazon’s documentation is not the friendliest. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/setting-up.html">setup guide</a> is fine enough, but after that I floundered a bit. The main problem is that, once you set up your Cloud9 environment, you’re in an IDE and it feels like you should be doing things “the Cloud9 way” in order to avoid getting bitten later. It turns out that, at least in my case, ignoring that concern is sufficient. Basically, treat the terminal the same way you’d treat any SSH session into an EC2 box that you were planning to use as a dev environment (so use package managers from the terminal, run tests there, etc) and use the file manager/editor for their basic use-cases (or just use the terminal for everything if you want!). My project is built on Lambda, and Cloud9 has some <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lambda-functions.html">decent Lambda-specific features</a> but don’t feel that you need to use Cloud9-specific features for build/deploy steps; that is not its core use-case.</p>

<p>Ultimately Cloud9 is just a small convenience layer on top of just spinning up your own EC2 instance to use as a dev box, but the convenience is well worth it IMO. You don’t pay extra for running Cloud9 (you’re only charged for the underlying EC2/EBS infra) and the fact that Cloud9 automatically manages starting/stopping the instance for you makes it way more cost-effective than running the instance directly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Following the BoF on power consumption of software Cornelius chaired at
<a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/09/15/kde-akademy-2020-recap.html">Akademy 2020</a> I did
look a bit into tooling for that, in particular for cheap ways to measure electrical power
consumption. Here are the results so far.</p>

<h3 id="why-measure-electrical-power-consumption">Why measure electrical power consumption?</h3>

<p>Our existing profiling tools for improving software performance implicitly also identify parts
that presumably increase the power consumption, and we do have specialized tools like <code>powertop</code> that
are good at identifying specific types of power drains. But not everything is visible in there,
e.g. CPU/GPU trade-offs, or the actual effects of power management options or display settings.</p>

<p>So being able to measure the actual power consumption between the wall plug and the full device seems
useful, to the very least to verify that assumptions we make from other profiling tools actually hold.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Measuring electrical power isn’t exactly an unsolved problem, even if it’s not entirely trivial when
looking at the combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power">alternating current</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply#Power_factor">switching power supplies</a>.
However, it’s not straightforward to find a solution when adding all our desired constraints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with a wide range of devices to measure without requiring modifications, and covering the total
power consumption, ideally something you just connect to the power plug and the wall socket.</li>
  <li>High time resolution: Power consumption of computing hardware can change very very rapidly, averaging
over a long time period might thus hide information relevant for us.</li>
  <li>Cheap: To actually make an impact, I think we need to spread the equipment widely in the community,
and that’s much more likely with tools that cost 10€ rather than a few k€.</li>
  <li>Easy and safe to operate for people without an electrical engineering background: Same as the above, that should
help spreading the tools widely.</li>
  <li>Bonus: Machine readable measurement data. That could allow us to build further software tools on top of this,
such as test automation or CI integration for checking for power regressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding a solution that covers some of those requirements isn’t particularly hard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you compromise on price, there’s beautiful professional equipment for this.</li>
  <li>If you compromise on time resolution, there’s reasonably accurate devices sold
for about 10€ in every hardware store as e.g. “energy monitor”, typically with a small
LCD screen showing the accumulated electricity use over a period of time.</li>
  <li>If you compromise on safety (or at least accept considerable effort to achieve safety),
the necessary sensors to build a DIY measurement device only cost a few Euros.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="repurposing-a-wifi-power-plug">Repurposing a Wifi power plug</h3>

<p>While preparing the office at work for full remote operations earlier this year I came across a type of devices that seemed
to check all those boxes though: A Wifi-controlled power plug capable of running a Free Software firmware and an integrated
power sensor.</p>

<p>To try this I got myself a few <a href="https://templates.blakadder.com/gosund_SP111_v2.html">Gosund SP111</a> for about 8€ a piece,
and replaced their firmware with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs">Tasmota</a>.
The <a href="https://github.com/tasmota/docs/blob/development/docs/devices/BlitzWolf-SHP6.md">manual flashing instructions</a> might look
a bit scary, but thanks to “opportunities” in their stock firmware this can also be done conveniently over the air using
<a href="https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert">tuya-convert</a>. Following the Docker-based approach in their
instructions made this work on first try without any issues for me. Out of the box this was already showing power measurements in its
web UI, with an update interval of a few seconds.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/67/tasmotized-gosund-sp111.jpg" alt="Picture of two Gosund SP111 Wifi power plugs and a screenshot of the Tasmota web interface running on it.">
  
  <figcaption>Gosund SP111 Wifi power plug and the Tasmota web interface running on it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial values were not at all plausible though, going through the
<a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Power-Monitoring-Calibration/">power calibration procedure</a> helped with that.
Reading out measurements automatically is possible via MQTT, so that’s covered as well.</p>

<p>At this point I was reading through the firmware code, assuming it would need adjustments to allow higher sample rates,
but it turns out we can get this down to 200ms by just sending the right MQTT commands. The two following crude scripts running
in parallel produce a CSV stream with the various measurement values.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/VoltRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"3"</span>
mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/AmpRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"3"</span>
mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/PowerRes"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"5"</span>

<span>while </span><span>true</span><span>;</span> <span>do
    </span>usleep 200000
    mosquitto_pub <span>-t</span> <span>"cmnd/tasmota/STATUS"</span> <span>-m</span> <span>"10"</span>
<span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This sets the device to report measurements in the highest available resolution, and then polls in a 200ms interval. The
results are received and unpacked by the next script. Its output is CSV that can be redirected as needed.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>"Time;Voltage;Current;Power;Apparent Power;Reactive Power;Factor"</span>

<span>done</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="visualizing-measurements">Visualizing measurements</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of ways to process the CSV data, a real-time view turned out to be quite useful though. As the data
can be rather noisy a basic smoothing filter also helps to make things easier to read.</p>

<p>KDE’s <a href="https://labplot.kde.org/">LabPlot</a> can consume CSV “streams” and has the right filters for this. Unfortunately
its filters cannot be applied in realtime yet, so the LapPlot team pointed me to a much older KDE application that can do this:
<a href="https://github.com/Kst-plot/kst">Kst</a>. It’s filters are frequency-based, so we need a low-pass filter to smooth the
measurements. Not as nice as what LabPlot produces IMHO, but it gets the job done.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>Good news first: This is sensitive enough to see the impact of simple user interactions, power saving options
(ie. the Good/Bad toggles in <code>powertop</code>), display brightness changes, etc.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/67/power-usage-while-moving-mouse-cursor.png" alt="Plot of an example measurement showing power over time.">
  
  <figcaption>Example measurement (200ms sample interval, no filter): mouse cursor being moved between samples 100 and 150, with a peak while hovering a task bar entry.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>How good this is, ie. how close the reported values get to reality, and to what extend the noise is inherent to the sensor
I have no idea though, lacking a calibrated reference to compare this to. Based on suggestions found online on how to reduce the
noise by hardware modifications I have to assume most of that is coming from the sensor.</p>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>

<p>There’s plenty of things to further investigate here still, both regarding assessing and improving the quality and resolution
of the measurements (e.g. by looking into increasing the sampling frequency by modifying the Tasmota firmware, assuming that is even
useful), and regarding establishing the power impact of software settings or options.</p>

<p>While not doing work that we don’t need to do is of course better either way, there are many less obvious questions to investigate
with this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can we enable more of the power management options exposed by <code>powertop</code> by default? There’s probably good reasons why they are off,
but maybe that selection can be done more targeted? Or if it’s about user-decided trade-offs, maybe that can be made easier accessible
for more users?</li>
  <li>How do operations on the CPU and GPU compare, or different ways of accessing the GPU? Thinking about the various compositor settings here for example.</li>
  <li>How do we best perform long-running background tasks? As fast as possible with all available resources, or stretched out over time?</li>
  <li>Can we somehow make automatic screen brightness control more clever, e.g. by improving idle or presence detection?</li>
  <li>Can we save power by making a dark color scheme the default on OLED screens?</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just scratching the surface I guess.</p>

<p>As I didn’t break any of the Wifi power-plugs during these experiments, I still have two spares I can pass to anyone in the community
interested in digging into this as well!</p>

The same thing happens when cleaning your data, it’s filtering what we want and removing what we don’t want to make the raw data useful and not raw anymore. You can do the cleaning with Python, R, or whatever language you prefer but in this tutorial, I’m going to explain how you can clean your text files at the command line &nbsp;files by giving insights from a paper researching clickbait and non-clickbait data.</p><p>This tutorial is mainly motivated by <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">Data Science at the Command Line</a></p><h6>Disclosure: <em>The two Amazon links for the book (in this section) are paid links so if you buy the book, I will have a small commission</em></h6><p>This book tries to catch your attention on the ability of the command line when you do data science tasks - meaning you can obtain your data, manipulate it, explore it, and make your prediction on it using the command line. If you are a data scientist, aspiring to be, or want to know more about it, I&nbsp;highly recommend this book. You can read it online for free from <a href="https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/">its website</a> or order an <a href="https://amzn.to/33y5EkR">ebook or paperback</a>.&nbsp;In this tutorial we're gonna focus on using the command line to clean our data.</p><h2>Pulling and running the docker image</h2><p>To remove the hassle of downloading files we deal with and dependencies we need, I've made a docker image for you that has all you need. You just pull it from docker hub and you'll find what you need to play with to let you focus on the cleaning part.&nbsp;So let's<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ezzeddin/clean-data"> pull that image</a> and then run it interactively to enter the shell and write some command-lines.</p><div><pre>$ docker pull ezzeddin/clean-data
$ docker run --rm -it ezzeddin/clean-data
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>docker run </strong>is a command to run the docker image</li><li>the option <strong>--rm </strong>is set to remove the container after it exists</li><li>the option <strong>-it</strong> which is a combination of <strong>-i </strong>and <strong>-t </strong>is set for an interactive process (shell)</li><li><strong>ezzeddin/clean-data </strong>is the docker image name</li></ul><p>If using docker is still unclear for you, you can see <a href="https://www.ezzeddinabdullah.com/posts/penguins-in-docker-a-tutorial-on-why-we-use-docker">why we use docker tutorial</a></p><h2>Cleaning text files</h2><p>Let's clean two text files containing <a href="https://github.com/bhargaviparanjape/clickbait/tree/master/dataset">clickbait and non clickbait</a> headlines for 16,000 articles each.&nbsp;This data is used from a paper titled: <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~achakrab/papers/chakraborty_clickbait_asonam16.pdf"><strong>Stop Clickbait: Detecting and Preventing Clickbaits in Online News Media</strong></a> at <em>2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM). </em>Our goal here is to get the most common words used in both clickbait and non-clickbait headlines.</p><p>If you list what's inside the container you'll see two text files called <em>clickbait_data </em>and <em>non_clickbait_data</em>. Let's see what the final output first that we want to get. For the clickbait data, we want the most common 20 words to be represented like this with their counts:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e590d4bb2d5e8b98f68d_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the&nbsp;Author</figcaption></figure><p>And for the most 20 common words of non-clickbait headlines:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e5ff1f4c25700461fbc8_non_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>Let's see how we can get these histograms through the command line by taking it step by step. After running the docker image, we're now in a new shell with the new environment Let's first see what the <em>clickbait_data </em>file<em> </em>has by getting the first 10 lines of it:</p><p>So it seems this file has headlines that are labeled as clickbait as you can see:</p><div><pre>Should I Get Bings

</pre></div><p>We're interested in words here not phrases, so we can get words starting from 3 letters to more with:</p><div><pre>$ head clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}'
</pre></div><p><strong>head clickbait_data </strong>is used here because we're doing statistics here on the couple of headlines at the top of the file which is piped to the next grep command <strong>grep -oE '\w{3,}'</strong></p><p><strong>grep </strong></p><p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-oE -o </strong>for getting only matching words and <strong>-E </strong>for using extended regular expression which is the next pattern</p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\w{3,}' </strong>this pattern is like <strong>'\w\w\w+' </strong>which matches whole words with 3 letters or more</p><p>In order to get the counts of each word we need to first get the unique words which we can get by <strong>uniq </strong>command with the option <strong>-c </strong>to give you counts, but to let <strong>uniq &nbsp;</strong>delete duplicate words you need to sort first:</p><div><pre>$ head clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c
</pre></div><p>This command is done on the first 10 lines, let's do it across the entire clickbait headlines:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre></div><ul role="list"><li><strong>cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c</strong> we're now putting this command (to get all the words across the clickbait data)&nbsp;into the standard input of the next command</li><li><strong>sort -nr</strong> to sort numerically in a reverse order to get the highest count first</li><li><strong>head </strong>to get the first 10 common words</li></ul><p>Here is the output of the previous command:</p><div><pre>   5538 You

   1396 For
   1326 What
   1242 Will
</pre></div><p>Looks like we're close now to be in a good shape, let's see what we can do to better clean that up.</p><p>If we get a deeper look</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89fb80aeaee61427802c66_deeper-look.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@dtravisphd?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">David Travis</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/glasses?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can see we're missing small letters and all caps letters. For example, for the 'You' word we're missing 'you' and we're also missing 'YOU'. Let's try to see if these words already exist:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep you
$ cat clickbait_data | grep -oE '\w{3,}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep YOU
</pre></div><p>So as we can see:</p><p>We're missing 2 words that each can contribute to our counts to the 'You' occurrence and 'Your' to make them 5540 and 2540 respectively.</p><p>What we need to do first is to convert each capital letter into small ones using <strong>tr </strong>which is a command-line utility that translates characters:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre></div><p><strong>tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' </strong>here translates the contents of <em>clickbait_data </em>into lower-case. <strong>['upper'] </strong>is a character class that represents all upper case characters and <strong>['lower'] </strong>is a character class that represents all lower case characters.</p><p>To prepend these values with the header, we can use <strong>sed </strong>to put two column names to represent each column:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | sed '1i count,word' | head 
</pre></div><p><strong>sed '1i count,word' </strong>so we’re having <em>count</em> representing the number of occurrences and <em>word</em> obviously representing the word</p><p><strong>1i </strong>is used here to write these two words at the first line and the change in the file will be in-place</p><p>outputting:</p><div><pre>count,word 
5540 you
4992 the
2540 your
1950 that
1944 are
1812 this
1653 and
1397 for
1326 what
</pre></div><p>In order to print that in a pretty shape we can use <strong>csvlook </strong>which will get us this:</p><div><pre>| count        | word |
| ------------ | ---- |
|    5540 you  |      |
|    4992 the  |      |
|    2540 your |      |
|    1950 that |      |
|    1944 are  |      |
|    1812 this |      |
|    1653 and  |      |
|    1397 for  |      |
|    1326 what |      |
</pre></div><p>which is not pretty at all. The reason this happened is that <strong>csvlook </strong>works as its name indicates to a better look for a CSV&nbsp;file so we should have a CSV (Comma Separated&nbsp;Value)&nbsp;file first. We should then find a way to separate each value at each line with a comma. At this point, we can use <strong>awk </strong>which is a pattern-directed scanning and processing language:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $1","$2}' | sed '1i count,word' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><p><strong>awk '{print $1","$2}' </strong></p><p><strong>'{</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print $1 </strong>here prints the first field (which is the count column) followed by...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>"," </strong>a comma followed by...</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$2 </strong>the second field which is the word column</p><p><strong>}'</strong></p><p>It seems we're in much better shape now:</p><div><pre>| count | word |
| ----- | ---- |
| 5,540 | you  |
| 4,992 | the  |
| 2,540 | your |
| 1,950 | that |
| 1,944 | are  |
| 1,812 | this |
| 1,653 | and  |
| 1,397 | for  |
| 1,326 | what |
</pre></div><p>If we want to get the word column in the first field and the count column in the second field, we just need to reverse the order in the <strong>awk </strong>and <strong>sed </strong>command:</p><div><pre>$ cat clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2","$1}' | sed '1i word,count' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><p>In order to get the same output for the non-clickbait data, we just need to change the filename:</p><div><pre>$ cat non_clickbait_data | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| grep -oE '\w{3,}' \
| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2","$1}' | sed '1i word,count' | head | csvlook
</pre></div><h2>Getting insight into the clickbait study</h2><p>In this study as reported by the <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~achakrab/papers/chakraborty_clickbait_asonam16.pdf">paper</a>, it addresses the clickbait and non-clickbait headlines to be able to detect both as</p><blockquote>Most of the online news media outlets rely heavily on the revenues generated from the clicks made by their readers, and due to the presence of numerous such outlets, they need to compete with each other for reader attention.</blockquote><p>So what's in this tutorial is a way to clean up data through the command-line so that we can get some insights about the result of this paper and see if we can get some points claimed by the paper through their research.</p><p>Again, let's see the final distribution of the most 20 common words for clickbait headlines for this data is:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f359c073455c743bc873ee4/5f89e590d4bb2d5e8b98f68d_clickbait_20_words.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Image by the Author</figcaption></figure><p>we can obviously see the excessive use of the possessive case <em>you </em>and not using the third person references like <em>he, she, </em>or a specific name</p><p>and …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>So much of the technology in <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/category/black-panther-2018/?order=asc"><em>Black Panther</em></a> appears to work by mental command (so far: <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/2020/08/24/panther-suit-2-0/">Panther Suit 2.0</a>, the <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/2020/09/07/the-royal-talon-piloting-interface/">Royal Talon</a>, and the <a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/2020/09/21/vibranium-sand-tables/">vibranium sand tables</a>) that…</p>

<p>…I wanted check on the state of the art of brain-computer interfaces (or BCIs) and see how our understanding had advanced since I wrote the Brain interface chapter in <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/make-it-so/">the book</a>, back in the halcyon days of 2012.</p>

<p>Note that I am deliberately avoiding the <em>tech</em> side of this question. I’m not going to talk about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875">EEG</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078">PET</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768">MRI, and fMRI</a>. (Though they’re linked in case you want to learn more.) Modern brain-computer interface (or BCI) technologies are evolving too rapidly to bother with an overview of <em>them</em>. They’ll change in the real world by the time I press “publish,” much less by the time you read this. And sci-fi tech is most often a black box anyway. But the <em>human</em> part of the human-computer interaction model changes much more slowly. We can look to the brain as a relatively-unalterable component of the BCI question, leading us to two believability questions of sci-fi BCI.</p>



<ol><li>How can people express <em>intent</em> using their brains?</li><li>How do we prevent accidental activation using BCI?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s discuss each.</p>



<h3>1. How can people express intent using their brains? </h3>



<p>In the <em>see-think-do</em> loop of human-computer interaction…</p>



<ul><li><em>See</em> (perceive) has been a subject of visual, industrial, and auditory design.</li><li><em>Think</em> has been a matter of human cognition as informed by system interaction and content design.</li><li><em>Do</em> has long been a matter of some muscular movement that the system can detect, to start its matching <em>input-process-output</em> loop. Tap a button. Move a mouse. Touch a screen. Focus on something with your eyes. Hold your breath. These are all ways of “doing” with muscles.</li></ul>

<p>But the first promise of BCI is to let that <em>doing</em> part happen with your brain. The brain isn’t a <em>muscle</em>, so what actions are BCI users able to take <em>in their heads</em> to signal to a BCI system what they want it to do? The answer to this question is partly physiological, about the way the brain changes as it goes about its thinking business.</p>

<p>Our brains are a dense network of bioelectric signals, chemicals, and blood flow. But it’s not chaos. It’s organized. It’s <em>locally functionalized</em>, meaning that certain parts of the brain are predictably activated when we think about certain things. But it’s not like the Christmas lights in Stranger Things, with one part lighting up discretely at a time. It’s more like an animated <a href="http://proportional symbol map">proportional symbol map</a>, with lots of places lighting up at the same time to different degrees.</p>

<p>The sizes and shapes of what’s lighting up may change slightly between people, but a basic map of healthy, undamaged brains will be similar to each other. Lots of work has gone on to map these functional areas, with researchers showing subjects lots of stimuli and noting what areas of the brain light up. Test enough of these subjects and you can build a pretty good functional map of concepts. Thereafter, you can take a “picture” of the brain, and you can cross-reference your maps to reverse-engineer what is being thought.</p>

<p>Right now those pictures are pretty crude and slow, but so were <a href="https://petapixel.com/2015/05/23/20-first-photos-from-the-history-of-photography/#:~:text=The%20First%20Photograph,the%20Burgundy%20region%20of%20France.">the first actual photographs in the world</a>. In 20–50 years, we may be able to wear baseball caps that provide a much more high-resolution, real time inputs of concepts being thought. In the far future (or, say, the alternate history of the <a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies">MCU</a>) it is conceivable to read these things from a distance. (Though there are <em>significant</em> ethical questions involved in such a technology, this post is focused on questions of viability and interaction.)</p>

<p>Similarly the brain maps we have are only for a small percentage of an average adult vocabulary. Jack Gallant’s semantic map viewer (pictured and linked above) shows the maps for about 140 concepts, and estimates of average active vocabulary is <a href="https://wordcounter.io/blog/how-many-words-does-the-average-person-know/#:~:text=According%20to%20lexicographer%20and%20dictionary,vocabulary%20is%20around%2040%2C000%20words.%E2%80%9D">around 20,000 words</a>, so we’re looking at a tenth of a tenth of what we can imagine (not even counting the infinite composability of language). But in the future we will not only have more concepts mapped, more confidently, but we will also have idiographs for each individual, like the personal dictionary in your smart phone.</p>



<p>All this is to say that our extant real world technology confirms that <em>thoughts</em> are a believable input for a system. This includes linguistic inputs like “Turn on the light” and “activate the vibranium sand table” and “Sincerely, Chris” and even <em>imagining</em> the desired change, like a light changing from dark to light. It might even include subconscious thoughts that yet to be formed into words.</p>



<h3>2. How do we prevent accidental activation?</h3>



<p>But we know from personal experience, we don’t want <em>all</em> our thoughts to be acted on. Take, for example, those thoughts you’re feeling <a href="https://bradfordhealth.com/halt-hunger-anger-loneliness-tiredness/">hangry</a>, or snarky, or dealing with a jerk-in-authority. Or those texts and emails that you’ve composed in the heat of the moment but wisely deleted before they get you in trouble.</p>

<p>If a speculative BCI is being read by a general artificial intelligence, it can manage that just like a smart human partner would.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>He is composing a blog post</em>, reasons the AGI, <em>so I will just disregard his thought that he needs to pee</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>And if there’s any doubt, an AGI can ask. <strong>“Did you intend me to include the bit about pee in the post?”</strong> Me: <strong>“Certainly not. Also BRB.”</strong> (Readers following the <em><a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/category/black-panther-2018/?order=asc">Black Panther</a></em> reviews will note that AGI is available to Wakandans in the form of Griot.)</p>



<p>If AGI is <em>unavailable</em> to the diegesis (and it would significantly change any diegesis of which it is a part) then we need some way to indicate when a thought is intended as input and when it isn’t. Having that be some <em>mode</em> of thought feels complicated and error-prone, like when programmers have to write regex expressions that escape escape characters. Better I think is to use some secondary channel, like a bodily interaction. Touch forefinger and pinky together, for instance, and the computer understands you intend your thoughts as input.</p>



<p><strong>So, for any BCI that appears in sci-fi, we would want to look for the presence or absence of AGI as a <em>reasonableness</em> interpreter, and, barring that, for some alternate-channel mechanism for indicating deliberateness. We would also hope to see some feedback and correction loops to understand the nuances of the edge-case interactions, but these are rare in sci-fi.</strong></p>

<h2>Even more future-full</h2>



<p>This all points to the question of what <em>seeing/perceiving</em> via a BCI might be. A simple example might be a disembodied voice that only the user can hear.</p>



<blockquote><p>A woman walks alone at night. Lost in thoughts, she hears her AI whisper to her thoughts, “Ada, be aware that a man has just left a shadowy doorstep and is following, half a block behind you. Shall I initialize your <a href="https://www.gattamatta.com/electric_scenario.html">shock shoes</a>?”</p></blockquote>



<p>What other than language can be written to the brain in the far future? Images? Movies? Ideas? A suspicion? A compulsion? A hunch? How will people know what are their own thoughts and what has been placed there from the outside? I look forward to the stories and shows that illustrate new ideas, and warn us of the dark pitfalls.</p>

October 16, 2020 | http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/10base5/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://tech.mattmillman.com/projects/10base5/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I can hardly claim to have worked professionally with 10BASE5 as when I first started building my own 10BASE2 networks in 1997, 10BASE5 was long obsolete. Back then, I knew about 10BASE5, but it wasn’t practical, affordable or interesting enough for me to attempt building one.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012, and 10BASE5 is now truly a vintage technology. Anyone studying something&nbsp;I.T. related likely will at some point have been told about this stuff, because it’s very important in the history of computing. This was the first standardised, commercially used form of Ethernet, and today, almost the entire Internet is Ethernet, but heck, who’s ever actually seen a working 10BASE5 setup? Not me, that’s for sure, nor or anyone I’ve ever met.</p>
<p>So… can I build a working setup in 2012? Read on…</p>

<p>I’ve written this page primarily for people like myself, who came into the computing scene just a bit too late to have ever seen this technology in use. A 1980s network engineer can safely skip this page.</p>

<p>In order to connect to a true 10BASE5 network, network adapters with AUI are required. AUI stands for Attachment Unit Interface. It is in effect, a media independent form of all of the physical 10Mbit ethernet variants, which I shall call 10BASE-X. AUI was to 10BASE-X what MII is to 100BASE-X, with the exception that MII is rarely found as an external connector.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for this project, networking equipment with external AUI connectors is becoming rather difficult to find.</p>
<p>As I see it, there’s 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build true 10BASE5 nodes using equipment natively supporting AUI</li>
<li>Bridge to something else i.e. 10BASE-T</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building true 10BASE5 nodes</h2>
<p>Not many options remain for connecting to modern PCs. Here’s a few:</p>
<h3>ISA Cards</h3>
<p>While this can be done, modern mainboards with ISA slots are niche and very expensive. I ruled out this option.</p>

<h3>PCI Cards</h3>
<p>Fortunately, some modern PCs still have 32-Bit/5 volt parallel PCI slots, also, PCI and 10BASE5 had enough overlap that a small number of products were manufactured. A couple of examples are the 3Com 3C900B-COMBO, and 3C905B-COMBO. At the time of writing there were a fair few of these on eBay, but often for outrageous sums of money. Fortunately I managed to pick up a couple for a few quid. 64-Bit Windows drivers do not exist, making Windows 7 32-bit likely the last version of Windows able to make use of them, short of writing some new drivers. All versions of Linux will work OK with these.</p>

<h3>USB or other solutions</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell no USB product was ever made. With 10BASE5 MAU’s requiring 12 volts and some 5 or more watts of power, over and above what USB can provide, this would be a problematic proposition. Also, no single chip “USB with AUI” solutions exist. From my research, it seems theoretically possible to create a 2-chip adapter, with external power supply, but apparently there is no market for such as a thing.</p>

<p>But that didn’t stop me from building one. Above is what is quite possibly one of the worlds only USB Ethernet Adapters with AUI interface. I have a seperate project page for this&nbsp;<a href="http://tech.mattmillman.com/usbaui/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Routers</h3>
<p>A Cisco NM-1E2W module could be used if one has a large ISR kicking around.</p>
<h2>Bridging 10BASE5 to modern twisted pair networks</h2>
<h3>10BASE-T Hubs equipped with AUI</h3>
<p>Using a 10BASE-T hub with AUI to bridge to a twisted pair network is probably the easiest approach. There’s thousands of these for sale on eBay for peanuts, but in my case, having one of these on each node would make the setup rather clunky.</p>
<h3>10BASE-T to AUI Media converters</h3>
<p>What I was really looking for was a few of these little boxes. Easily mistaken for a 10BASE-T MAU, these (unlike the former which tend to be spilling out of every I.T. junk box in the land) are fairly uncommon.</p>

Spot the difference?</figcaption></figure>

<p>To keep the cost of this project to a minimum, I decided my network would only have 3-4 nodes as this was sufficient to demonstrate a proper shared media network as opposed to a 2 node effective “point to point” link. For this I sourced the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x 3Com 3C900B-COMBO PCI NICs with AUI</li>
<li>3x MiLAN MIL-130A AUI-to-10BASE-T bridges</li>
<li>1x MiLAN MIL-10P 10BASE-T Transceiver (for testing AUI nodes)</li>
<li>1x Allied Telesis MC12T</li>
<li>6x Cabletron ST-500 MAU’s</li>
<li>3x AMP 228752-1 Vampire taps</li>
<li>2x AMP 221914-1 Intrusive N connector taps</li>
<li>5x AUI Drop cables</li>
<li>15M of Belden #9880 cable</li>
<li>2x 50ohm N terminators</li>
<li>2x N female to female couplers</li>
<li>10x UNC 4-40 x 1.1/2″ countersunk screws (to replace missing ones on my MAUs)</li>
</ul>

<p>A common belief persists that 10BASE5 used RG-8/U cable. This, for the most part, appears to be untrue. The cable used was purpose designed for 10BASE5 and manufactured by Belden under the part number 9880 (A few other compatible cables may exist). The reason #9880 cable was specified is that several variants of RG-8 exist with varying dimensions and manufacturing standards. Given that the main form of connection of MAU’s to 10BASE5 networks was by the precisely designed prongs in “Vampire taps”, cable dimensions and dielectric consistency had to be spot on.</p>
<p>A network designed using only intrusive N connector taps such as AMP 221914-1 could get away with using pretty much any 50 ohm coax, but then the sum total of insertion losses created by each node may prevent the full 500M segment length from being achieved. Also, this approach wouldn’t permit addition of new nodes without bringing down the network. After an evening of wrestling with RG-8/U cable (why oh why didn’t I just buy RG-58) while attempting to make a short test lead, I think I’ll stick with the Vampire Taps.</p>
<p>For someone like me who hadn’t encountered it before, no amount of looking at pictures could prepare for how big this stuff is. Short of high power transmission cables, it’s the largest coaxial cable I’ve ever seen. It is also very heavy, rigid and the bend radius is absurdly large.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of this cable is the black bands which appear every 2.5M. In 10BASE5 networks, MAUs can only be attached at 2.5M intervals, this is to ensure that signal reflections generated by taps stay out of phase, which stops them compounding across the whole segment. In a small network such as mine, it’s probably not so important to respect this tap placement rule, but I’ll respect it anyway.</p>

<p>Unlike the BNC connectors found on 10BASE2, the official connector used by 10BASE5 (where connectors are required) is the N connector. While still used extensively in lab/specialist environments, this large coaxial connector isn’t something the average ‘tech dude’ is likely to encounter these days. They perform exceptionally, have an intrinsic impedance of 50 ohms, are fairly common/inexpensive and easily handle the large sized #9880 cable.</p>

<p>These cables sporting male and female 15-pin D-sub connectors, connect a node to the MAU. Since the MAU is bolted to a rigid behemoth piece of coax, it wasn’t exactly convenient to try and drag that lot down to the back of a PC, so these cables bridged that gap. With a maximum length of 50 metres, that gap can be very large indeed. Also, given that taps could only be placed at 2.5M intervals, a world without drop cables would lend its self to much humour around the office, at the expense of well-intended PC and desk placement considerations.</p>
<p>One notable feature is the slide locking mechanism used in place of the usual UNC 4-40 screws. It is my personal opinion that the design of this mechanism is a bit daft. In theory it’s a good idea but in practice I think it was implemented too flimsily. AUI drop cables are often very large and rigid (likely thanks to a half a dozen layers of shielding), so much so that a mild sideways nudge on a cable can easily rip a latched connector straight out of the socket, bending/breaking the mechanism. They also have a feature that the screws in the female end often work their way out over time, inevitably to be lost forever. Even during this small scale project, I have suffered some grief over these locking mechanisms. I can imagine they were a source of many support calls in the 80s and early 90s.</p>

<p>These metal boxes are one of the key defining pieces of kit in a 10BASE5 network. They function as the transceiver, converting the primitive signals from the AUI interface to what’s required on the physical media, as well as performing collision detection. They came in 4 flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE5 networks, using a Vampire Tap</li>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE5 networks, using N connectors (Rare)</li>
<li>With a tap for 10BASE2 networks, using BNC connectors</li>
<li>Without a tap (Buy your own)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose Cabletron ST-500’s, because they have blinky lights. The ST-500 (90 Series) would have been one of the last and most modern 10BASE5 MAUs manufactured. The internal component count (when compared with, say, a DEC h4000) is low.</p>

<p>By far the most common means of connection to the coax segment. The bottom half is plastic, I assume to eliminate ground loops by ensuring the braid remains electrically isolated from the metal case of the MAU. The top half is extruded aluminium. Each contains three prongs (two to connect to the braid, and one to the centre conductor). To me, the idea of using this style of connection to coaxial cable is ambitious, but it has to be said that a few spikes in a coaxial cable will equate to significantly less reflection and insertion loss …</p></div></div>

		<p><em>(This is an edited and expanded version of a talk I gave in Trento, Italy in June 2018, on a panel <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/why-digital-currency-wont-save-us">with Sheila Dow</a>.)</em></p>
<p>The topic today is “Digital currencies: threat or opportunity?”</p>
<p>I’d like to offer a third alternative: New digital currencies like bitcoin are neither a threat or an opportunity. They do not raise any interesting economic questions and do not pose any significant policy problems. They do not represent any kind of technological advance on existing payment systems, which are of course already digital. They are just another asset bubble, based on the usual mix of fraud and fantasy. By historical standards, they are not a very large or threatening bubble. There is nothing important about them at all.</p>
<p>Why might you conclude that the new digital currencies don’t matter?</p>
<p>– Aggregate size – the total value of all bitcoin is on the order of $200 billion, other digital currencies are much smaller. On the scale of modern financial markets that’s not much more than a rounding error.</p>
<p>– No articulation with the rest of the financial system. No banks or other important institutions rely on cryptocurrencies to settle transactions, or have substantial holdings on their balance sheets. They’re not used as collateral for loans.</p>
<p>– Not used to structure real activity. No significant part of collective productive or reproductive activity is organized by making payments or taking positions in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Besides that, these currencies don’t even do what they claim to do. In practice, digital currencies do depend on intermediaries. Payment is inconvenient and expensive — as much as $14 per transaction, and accepted by only 3 of top 500 online retailers. And markets in these currencies are not decentralized, but dominated by a few big players. All this is documented in Mike Beggs’ wonderful <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/04/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-monetary-system">Jacobin article on cryptocurrencies</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>Compare this to the mortgage market. Total residential mortgages in the US are over $13 trillion, not far short of GDP. The scale is similar in many other countries. Mortgages are a key asset for the financial system, even when not securitized. And of course they play a central role in organizing the provision of housing (and commercial space), an absolutely essential function to social reproduction.</p>
<p>And yet here we are talking about cryptocurrencies. Why?</p>
<p>Partly it’s just hard money crankery and libertarianism, which have a outsized voice in economics discussions. And partly it’s testimony to the success of their marketing machine. One might say that the only thing that stands behind that $200 billion value, is the existence of conversations like this one.</p>
<p>But it’s not just cranks and libertarians who care about cryptocurrencies. Central bank research departments are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-cenbank-idUSKBN26Z2R0">earnestly exploring</a> the development of digital currencies. This disproportionate attention reflects, I think, some deeper problems with how we think of money and central banking. The divide over whether crypto-currencies represent anything new or important reflects a larger divide over how we conceive of the monetary system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://jwmason.org/slackwire/dont-start-from-coin/">language of Schumpeter</a> — whose discussion in his <em>History of Economic Thought</em> remains perhaps the best starting point for thinking about these things — it comes down to whether we “start from the coin.” If we start from the coin, if we think of money as a distinct tangible thing, a special kind of asset, then bitcoin may look important. We could call this the quantity view of money. But if we follow Schumpeter — and in different ways Hyman Minsky, Perry Mehrling and David Graeber — and start from balance sheets, then it won’t. Call this the ledger view of money.</p>
<p>In the quantity view, “money” is something special. The legal monopoly of governments on printing currency is very important, because that is money in a way that other assets aren’t. Credit created by banks is something different. Digital currencies are a threat or opportunity, as the case may be, because they seem to also go in this exclusive “outside money” box.</p>
<p>But from the Minsky-Mehrling-Graeber point of view, there’s nothing special about outside money. It’s just another set of tokens for recording changes in the social ledger. What matters isn’t the way that changes are recorded, but the accounts themselves. From this perspective, “money” isn’t an asset, a thing, it is simply the arbitrary units in which ledgers are kept and contracts denominated.</p>
<p>The starting point, from this point of view, is a network of money payments and commitments. Some of these commitments structure real activity (I show up for work because I expect to receive a wage). Others are free-standing. (I pay you interest because I owe you a debt.) In either case money is simply a unit of account. I have made a promise to you, you have a made a promise to someone else; these promises are in some cases commitments to specific concrete activities (to show up for work and do what you’re told), but in other cases they are quantitative, measured as a certain quantity of “money.”</p>
<p>What does money mean here? Simply whatever will be accepted as fulfilment of the promise, as specified in whatever legal or quasi-legal provisions govern it. It is entirely possible for the unit of account to have no concrete existence at all. And in any case the concrete assets that will be accepted are never identical; their equivalence is to some extent a fiction enshrined in the terms of the contract, and to some extent the result of active interventions by whatever authorities are responsible for the payments system.</p>
<p>In short, the fact that some particular asset that serves as money in this or that case is not very interesting. What matters is the balance sheets. Money is just a means of recording changes on balance sheets, of making transfers between ledgers. If we take the ledger view, then there’s no difference between physical currency and an instrument like a check. In either case the social ledger maintained by the banking system has a certain credit to you. You want to transfer a part of that to someone else, for whatever reason. So you give that person a piece of paper with the amount written on it, and they take it to their bank, which adjusts the social ledger accordingly. It makes no difference whether the piece of paper is a dollar or euro bill or a check or a money order, any more than it matters what its physical dimensions are or whether it is one sheet of paper or two.</p>
<p>And of course the majority of transactions are made, the majority of obligations, are settled without using pieces of paper at all. In fact the range of transactions you can carry out using the pieces of paper we call “money” is rather limited.</p>
<p>To put it another way: At the train station there are various machines, which will give you a piece of paper while debiting your bank account. Some of those pieces of paper can be used in exchange for a train ride, others for various other purposes. We call one a ticket machine and one an ATM. But conceptually we should think of them as the same kind of machine. Both debit your social ledger and then give you a claim on something concrete — a paper from the newsstand, say, or a train ride, as the case may be.</p>
<p>In the quantity view of money, there is some special asset called money which the rest of the payments system builds off. So the fact that something else could “be” money seems important. It matters that the government has a legal monopoly on printing currency, so it also matters that something like cryptocurrency seems to evade that monopoly. In the ledger view, on the other hand, that legal monopoly doesn’t matter at all. There are lots of systems for making transfers between bank accounts, including many purely electronic ones. And there are social ledgers maintained by institutions that we don’t officially recognize as banks. New digital currencies introduce a few more of each. So what?</p>
<p>In the quantity view, money and credit are two distinct things. We start with money, which might then be lent. This is how we learn it as children. In the ledger view, money is just anything that settles an obligation. And that is constantly done by promises or IOUs. The fact that “banks create money” in our modern economy isn’t some kind of innovation out of an original situation of cash-on-the-barrelhead exchange. Rather, it is a restriction of money-creation from the historical situation where third-party IOUs of all kinds circulated as payment.</p>
<p>Related to this are two different views of central banks. In the quantity view, the fundamental role of the central bank is in some sense setting or managing the money supply. In the ledger view, where money is just an arbitrary subset of payments media, which is constantly being created and destroyed in the course of making payments, “the money supply” is a nonsense term. What central banks are doing in this view is controlling the elasticity of the credit system. In other words, they are managing the willingness and ability of economic units to make promises to each other.</p>
<p>There are a variety of objectives in this; two important ones today are to control the pace of real activity via the elasticity of money commitments (e.g. to <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/01/federal-reserve-interest-rate-increase-janet-yellen-inflation-unemployment/">keep the wage share within certain bounds</a> by controlling the level of aggregate employment) and to maintain the integrity of the payments system in a crisis where a wave of self-perpetuating defaults is possible.</p>
<p>In either case the thing which the central bank seeks to make more scarce or abundant is not the quantity of some asset labeled as “money”, but the capacity to make promises. To reduce the level of real activity, for example, the central bank needs to make it more difficult for economic units to make claims on real resources on the basis of promises of future payments. To avoid or resolve a crisis the central bank needs to increase the trustworthiness of units so they can settle outstanding obligations by making new promises; alternatively it can substitute its own …</p></div></article></div>

<h5>2,079,471 stars</h5>
<p>
To strike fear in the computing world, just whisper "traveling salesman problem."
The echo will be <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-quantum-computing-is-changing-the-world-three-israelis-are-leading-the-revolution-1.8530603">"if we want to figure out the route for 28 cities, the universe will die before we get the result."</a>
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the reputation of the problem is such that advances on small instances (using admittedly cool technology) are newsworthy, such as recent reports on a new AI <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a30655520/scientists-solve-traveling-salesman-problem/">"processor to solve 22 cities"</a> or an 8-stop tour found by an ameoba <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a25686417/amoeba-math/">"that might just change the face of computing forever"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our work is decidedly less exotic, but at a much, much larger scale.
With <a href="http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/">Keld Helsgaun</a>, from Roskilde University in Denmark, we aim to compute the shortest-possible tour through the <a href="http://www.mpia.de/~calj/tgas_distances/main.html">3D positions of over two million individual stars</a>, a point set based on the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-1">ESA Gaia Data Release 1</a>.
</p>


<h5>28,884,352 parsecs</h5>
<p>
From October 2017 through October 2019, week by week, we produced shorter and shorter 3D star tours, employing an array of heuristic-search techniques and ever-increasing amounts of computing power.
The foundation for this effort was Keld's <a href="http://akira.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/">LKH</a> software package, a powerhouse code for obtaining near-optimal solutions to the TSP and related routing problems. 
On top of LKH, we added methods specialized for such a large data set, combining local search and genetic algorithms, together with decomposition strategies to allow for parallel computation.
</p>

<p>
The search continued through the end of last year, but we found no further improvements on a solution from October 6, 2019.
That's the tour displayed in the moving image.
Its total length is 28,884,352.4 parsecs, or, if you prefer, 94,208,157.5 light years.
</p>


<h5>0.0000074 guarantee</h5>
<p>
A crucial point is this is not just any route through the stars.
Ours comes together with a proof that its length, if not the absolute shortest possible, is off by at most a factor of 0.0000074.
To put this in perspective, it's like a New York to Los Angles road trip guaranteed to be within half a city block of the optimal cross-country drive.
</p>

<p>
Our quality guarantee is provided by another difficult computation.
Over the past two-and-a-half years we have been running a linear programming, cutting-plane method to slowly close the gap between our solution and a lower bound on the length of each of the unimaginably many possible tours through the point set.
Our work here builds on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_TSP_Solver">Concorde TSP Solver</a>, again making numerous adjustments to handle the expectionally large number of points and to permit extensive parallel computation.
</p>

<h5>Parsecs to dollars</h5>
<p>
We know there is no tour more than 213.4 parsecs shorter than our route.
Close enough for Jean-Luc Picard, perhaps, but attacks on closing the remaining gap may lead to mathematical techniques having wide application beyond the world of Star Trek. 
If you think you can help, I'm offering a bounty of $50 for each parsec you can save by rearranging the flight through the stars.
It would aid our work to have an improved target tour if one exists, so I'm happy to offer a reward to encourage more eyes on the data set.
</p>

<p>
And don't worry about the budget.
Keld and I won $17,000 in a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths/overview">Kaggle competition</a> last year; I put some of my share aside to payoff any shortcut finders.

<p>Hello! 👋  My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>It was never part of my life goals to start my own company, let alone a company of one. In fact, if you had asked me before I actually took the leap if this was within the realm of possibility, I would have said <em>hell freakin’ no.</em></p>

<p>To be honest, I hadn’t thought about it even after I started working on Lunch Money. It was only after I saw success during launch that I decided to quit my freelancing jobs to pursue this endeavour full-time.</p>

<p>So why the 180-degree change? Upon reflection, I realized that the aggregate of my life and work experience made this a sensible decision and allowed me to transition easily into the role. I feel that I was ready for something like this for some time, but I had learned to be picky with what I spend my effort on and the right project never came up until Lunch Money. <strong>In this article, I will go into 4 specific life and career decisions that I consider foundational to my solopreneurship journey.</strong></p>



<p>I had never given much thought to how important transferrable skills were until I realized that simply being a software engineer at any tech company in the Bay Area did not result in more-or-less the same set of experiences and skills.</p>

<p>A friend told me a story of how working at [unnamed large software company] simplified a lot of processes for the sake of moving quickly. For instance, databases could be spun up via one-click deploy coupled with homegrown configuration files for adjustments. They’d later on realize as they were job hunting that setting up a data store was not so straight forward, but all the difficult parts had been abstracted out and they never got the chance to peek under the hood.</p>

<p>Consider two internships I had during my college years. The first was at Qualcomm– a large well-known international company with decades of proven engineering expertise. The second was a small seed-funded start-up of 3 founders, another intern and myself that had recently pivoted and hadn’t found their product market fit yet.</p>

<p>Granted that Qualcomm is in a totally different field of embedded software and hardware engineering, a lot of the tech I worked with was proprietary. I learned virtually no transferrable hard skills during my double-term internship at Qualcomm.</p>

<p>At the smaller (now defunct) start-up, I learned how to use Github. I worked with open source projects for the first time. I learned how to communicate with clients as I was building apps for them. I learned how to think about web versus mobile design. I learned a ton of Javascript. These are all skillsets I am still tapping into today.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, you need to be strategic with the company you choose to join. Your time is valuable!</p>



<p>I feel strongly that working on three different teams at Twitter helped me gain experience critical to running Lunch Money on my own today. I stayed on each team for roughly 1 year, having made significant impact before moving onto the next.</p>

<p>I started on Observability which was responsible for building a monitoring tool for internal use. I was specifically hired to work on the front-end side of things so I had full autonomy over the UI and UX of these dashboards.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/observability.png" alt=""> <span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/a/2013/observability-at-twitter.html" target="_blank">source</a></span><span>I designed and implemented data visualization and monitoring systems using Ruby on Rails and backbone.js at Twitter</span></p>

<p>I would have probably stayed on longer if it weren’t for my manager and another team that was looking to “borrow” an engineer for some high priority growth initiatives. My manager volunteered me and I was excited to work on a public-facing project for once. Little did I know there was a breakdown in communication and the receiving team, hearing that I was coming from “Platform Engineering”, assumed that I was a backend and Scala wiz.</p>

<p>Despite my initial uneasiness, I tapped into my “fake it til you make it” mentality and I learned Scala on the job. It wasn’t easy going from Javascript to a strongly-typed language but with a few late nights and the help of some very patient engineers, I was able to ship a couple of high impact features. I also ended up being the sole backend engineer supporting the new user onboarding process during the World Cup.</p>

<p>I later switched to the messaging team (working on SMS, push notifications and email) where I rewrote from scratch the entire infrastructure that interpreted text messages.</p>

<p>All in all, I left Twitter with an incredible breadth and depth of experience– having worked up and down the stack, in both existing codebases and greenfield projects, on my own and under the watchful eye of staff engineers. I gained an unreal amount of confidence in my engineering skills and more importantly, my ability to learn a new technology quickly.</p>



<p>In my early 20s, I got really into electronic dance music (EDM). I found myself going out dancing most Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Since San Francisco was home to numerous clubs, it became a chore to discover events. You basically had to go to each individual venue’s (often janky) website and navigate their calendars to find what was coming up. From there, specific event details were either on Facebook or ticketing platforms like Eventbrite, Ticketfly, etc.</p>

<p>I later found out from a friend that there used to be a popular site that aggregated all EDM events in the Bay Area until it eventually shut down. I thought this was a fantastic idea and well within my technical scope so I got to work.</p>

<p>I hammered out a minimal viable product (MVP) with Ruby on Rails (thanks to having learned this on the job at Twitter). The MVP was basically a one-pager with a list of manually-inserted events for the next 2 weeks. I started to tell my friends about the site and it quickly proved invaluable.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/futuraretro1.png" alt=""> <span>The first iteration of futuraretro</span></p>

<p>Fuelled by passion, I poured hours of effort every week into growing my site. I learned to incorporate the Gracenote API which would label each event with the specific genre of EDM. The Eventbrite and Ticketfly APIs helped automate adding new event details. I implemented a form where promoters could suggest upcoming shows. I started a Facebook page which grew to hundreds of followers. I sent out weekly emails via Mailchimp and made a few bucks every month with affiliate ads.</p>

<p>Over the course of several months, word of mouth continued to spread and my site ultimately peaked at 1000 weekly active users.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/futuraretro2.png" alt="">
<span>The second and last redesign of futuraretro</span></p>

<p>The coolest part (which I’ve yet to re-experience with Lunch Money) was when I met someone at a show. I asked them if they had heard of my site and they pulled up their phone to show me it was the last site they had visited. That blew my mind!</p>

<p>The eventual fade of my interest in EDM also meant the end of futuraretro. While it didn’t get anywhere significant, I strengthened my muscle of “learning by doing”. Since then, I’ve started a number of other micro-sites spawned from short-lived curiosities and interests. My first few projects did not end up being the breakthrough ones but they helped me get used to putting myself out there and launching things.</p>



<p>Moving out of San Francisco permanently and subsequently taking a sabbatical helped strip away the biases that were stemming from my environment. If you were to ask me when I was living in San Francisco my motivations for wanting to start a company, my honest answer would probably be related to boosting my ego, gaining clout among my Silicon Valley peers, or making a ton of money so I could afford a little condo in the Mission.</p>

<p><a href="https://lunchbag.ca/pre-departure-thoughts/">I took significant time off to travel in 2017</a>. I sought after experiences I knew I would never come across otherwise such as spending time <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/thailand/">in various abodes in Northeastern Thailand</a> and <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/lunchbag-in-france-living-in-the-mountains/">the French countryside</a>. Being in new and unfamiliar environments helped me see almost right away that I wanted to end up in Toronto. I was reminded of the other joys in life– family, nature and community, and <a href="https://lunchbag.ca/checking-in-things-i-ve-learned/">I gained clarity on myself</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/sabbatical.jpg" alt=""><span>Pure joy in the Burgundy countryside where I spent 5 weeks as a bartender and waitress at a French restaurant</span></p>

<p>It may seem drastic, but leaving behind all my comforts was my big ‘ah ha!’ moment. I don’t think it changed me as a person, rather, it allowed me to recalibrate for my desired life path without external influences.</p>

<p>Now that I have a better footing on my goals and values, I am rebuilding my life around that and I couldn’t be happier. See, if I wanted to make a bunch of money and make a name for myself, I would not be a solopreneur. Solopreneurship optimizes for freedom first, not money. And right now, running Lunch Money as a company of one while living in Taipei is exactly where I want to be.</p>

<p>My journey was largely influenced by my extensive technical background, and I’d love to take this space to highlight someone else’s story. <a href="https://allisonseboldt.com/">Allison Seboldt</a>, solo founder of <a href="https://fantasycongress.com/">Fantasy Congress</a> and a political sciences major, shares her approach into web development <a href="https://allisonseboldt.com/how-i-got-my-first-job-as-a-developer/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This post details my adventures with the Linux virtual memory subsystem, and my discovery of a creative way to taunt the OOM (out of memory) killer by accumulating memory in the kernel, rather than in userspace.</p>



<p>Keep reading and you’ll learn:</p>



<ul><li>Internal details of the Linux kernel’s demand paging implementation</li><li>How to exploit virtual memory to implement highly efficient sparse data structures</li><li>What page tables are and how to calculate the memory overhead incurred by them</li><li>A cute way to get killed by the OOM killer while appearing to consume very little memory (great for parties)</li></ul>



<h2>Part 1: Demand paging is nuanced</h2>



<p>As usual, the story begins with me asking questions about implementation details. This time, about the Linux kernel’s demand paging implementation.</p>



<p>In Operating Systems 101 we learn that operating systems are “lazy” when they allocate memory to processes. When you mmap() an anonymous page, the kernel slyly returns a pointer immediately. It then waits until you trigger a page fault by “touching” that memory before doing the real memory allocation work. This is called “demand paging”.</p>



<p>This is efficient — if the memory is never touched, no physical memory is ever allocated. This also means you can allocate virtual memory in vast excess of what is physically available (“overcommit”), which can be useful.<span id="easy-footnote-1-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-496" title="Some examples of applications that allocate immense virtual memory are Address Sanitizer and Webkit."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. You just can’t touch it all.</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper. Barring execution, “touching” memory means reading or writing. Writes to a new mmap’d region require the kernel to perform a full memory allocation. You need memory, you need it <em>now</em>, and the kernel can’t push it off any longer.</p>



<p>Now, the question: <strong>What about reads?</strong></p>



<p>Unlike writes, reads to a new mmap’d region do <em>not</em> trigger a memory allocation. The kernel continues to push off the allocation by exploiting how new anonymous mappings must be zero initialized. Instead of allocating memory, the kernel services the page fault using the “zero page”: a pre-allocated page of physical memory, completely filled with zeros. In theory this is “free” — a single physical frame can back all zero-initialized pages.</p>



<p>The point? <strong>Demand paging is nuanced — not all ways of accessing a new mapping require the kernel to allocate memory</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s see what this looks like in the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/mm/memory.c#L4191">source</a>. The core page fault handler, <code>handle_mm_fault</code> is in <code>mm/memory.c</code>. A few calls deep via <code>__handle_mm_fault</code> and <code>handle_pte_fault</code>, we hit this block:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code>static vm_fault_t handle_pte_fault(struct vm_fault *vmf)
{
	// ...

	if (!vmf-&gt;pte) {
		if (vma_is_anonymous(vmf-&gt;vma))
			return do_anonymous_page(vmf);
		else
			// ...
	}

	// ...
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Which leads us to <code>do_anonymous_page</code> — the core page fault handler for anonymous pages. </p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code>static vm_fault_t do_anonymous_page(struct vm_fault *vmf)
{
	// ...
	
	if (pte_alloc(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;pmd))
		return VM_FAULT_OOM;
	// ...

	/* Use the zero-page for reads */
	if (!(vmf-&gt;flags &amp; FAULT_FLAG_WRITE) &amp;&amp; // (1)
			!mm_forbids_zeropage(vma-&gt;vm_mm)) {
		entry = pte_mkspecial(pfn_pte(my_zero_pfn(vmf-&gt;address), // (2)
						vma-&gt;vm_page_prot));
		vmf-&gt;pte = pte_offset_map_lock(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;pmd,
				vmf-&gt;address, &amp;vmf-&gt;ptl);
		// ...
		goto setpte;
	}
	// ...
setpte:
	set_pte_at(vma-&gt;vm_mm, vmf-&gt;address, vmf-&gt;pte, entry); // (3)
	// ...
	return ret;

	// ...
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Bingo. It checks whether a read caused the fault (1), then maps the virtual page to the zero page (2 and 3).</p>



<p>Note that this all happens in the page fault handler, which is an implementation choice. The mmap <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8.12/source/mm/mmap.c#L1687">core logic</a> does not touch the page tables at all, and only records the presence of the new mapping. It leaves the mapping’s page table entry non-present (present bit = 0) which will trigger a page fault on access.</p>



<p>Alternatively, mmap could proactively allocate the page table entry, and initialize it to the zero page. This would avoid a page fault on the first read, but at the cost of initializing (potentially many) page table entries up front. Given that it’s most efficient to be maximally lazy, the current implementation is best.</p>



<h2>Part 2: Allocating infinite memory, and touching it too</h2>



<p>This led me to another question. Since reads from anonymous mappings are “free”, in addition to allocating excessive virtual memory, can’t you actually touch all of it? As long as that “touch” is a read?</p>



<p>Time for an experiment. Here’s some code that allocates 100 GB of linear memory, and tries to read from the first byte of each page. It allocates 512 MB at a time because I <a href="https://twitter.com/damageboy/status/1317676450393300994">incorrectly thought</a> you couldn’t mmap 100GB at once <s>you can’t directly ask mmap for 100 GB 🙂</s>.<span id="easy-footnote-2-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-496" title="Thanks to <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/damageboy&quot;>@damageboy</a> for pointing this out."><sup>2</sup></a></span><span id="easy-footnote-3-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-496" title="This is lazy, dirty research code :) It is not sound or portable, and only just works because Linux happens to place the mmaps contiguously, growing down in memory."><sup>3</sup></a></span> My test system was a x64 Ubuntu 20.04 VPS.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

<p>When we run it, here’s what we see:</p>

<p>htop confirms that 100 GB of virtual memory is allocated (VIRT column), but a much more reasonable 1540 KB of resident memory (RES) is actually occupying RAM. Note the MINFLT column — this is the number of “minor” page faults that have occurred. A minor page fault is one that does not require loading from disk. We will be triggering lots of these and should expect to see this number grow dramatically.</p>



<p>Here’s what happens after I press enter to trigger reading.</p>



<div><pre><code>0x7f26cd300000 198

<p>The process hits the “Done!” print. This means it successfully touched every page of the 100 GB allocation!</p>

<p>htop confirms that many minor faults have occurred. We would expect it to cause exactly 26214400 faults (100 GB / 4 KB), and indeed, 26214552 – 26214400 = 152, the number we started with. Intriguingly, the resident memory appears to have also increased, which should not have happened. See the <a href="#rss-spike">Appendix A</a> for discussion of this.</p>



<p>Here’s a video to see it all in action:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Allocating 100 GB and touching it all (Demand Paging Pt 1)" width="625" height="469" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYNMt6FWsI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>So the theory is confirmed! You can apparently “Allocate your memory, and touch it too” (as long as that touch is a read).</strong><span id="easy-footnote-4-496"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-496" title="Or if you prefer, the famous Henry Ford <a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/23494-any-customer-can-have-a-car-painted-any-colour-that&quot;>quote</a>:  &amp;#8220;You can touch as much memory as you want, as long as you are only reading&amp;#8221;."><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>



<p>If your application, for some reason, benefits from the ability to have a 100 GB array of zeros then this is perfect for you. What about the rest of us?</p>



<p>A closer-to-real-life application is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">sparse array</a>. A sparse array is a (typically very large) array, whose elements are mostly zero. By exploiting demand paging, you can implement a memory efficient sparse array, where the majority of the array is backed by the zero page (or not even mapped). You get the fast indexing benefits of an array while avoiding the memory overhead.</p>



<h2>Part 3: Playing with a killer</h2>



<p>I have a confession. Remember when I said not all ways of accessing memory require the kernel to allocate memory? Yeah, that’s a lie.</p>



<p>Even though a read can be serviced by the shared zero page, that doesn’t mean no memory is allocated. Even the process of mapping a zero page requires allocating  memory. And here’s where we get into the nitty gritty.</p>



<h3>The hidden overhead of page tables</h3>



<p>The overhead comes from the virtual memory infrastructure itself — the page tables. Page tables are data structures that power the virtual memory subsystem. Like regular data structures, they occupy memory, only their overhead is easy to overlook, since it’s hidden from userspace.</p>



<p>This is what page tables on x86_64 look like:</p>

<p>Vim is a highly customizable text editor geared towards writing code.
But open-ended configuration possibilities often lure users into wasting time while chasing after perceived minute gains in productivity.
This article describes my Vim journey, starting from heavy personal customization and ending with a renewed love for defaults.</p>

<h2 id="porn">Porn</h2>

<p>As a rule, new users, right after introduction to a few basic commands, start indulging in Vim configuration porn.
Such porn has various different flavours.
There is the “exhibitionist” variety which includes dressing Vim up in status lines, colorschemes, and font decorations in order to impress others.
It often leads to Vim being displayed on videos and, nomen omen, “vim-porn” screenshots.
There is an “integrated” category where people plug and stretch their Vim until it resembles an IDE.
Git integration, autocompletion, language servers, refactoring, and debugging are the tools of trade in this version.
And then there are a few more variants, including “fuzzy”, “packaged”, “conveniently re-mapped”, and I am sure anyone could think up some of their own.</p>

<p>My particular genre was “consistency” - I wanted my Vim to be intuitive and predictable.
While working I would constantly keep an eye for digressions in Vim’s behaviour and then spend my time trying to adjust them.
In my fantasy Vim had to feel intuitive and smooth so I tried to correct every little detail.
And, despite “consistency” porn being quite vanilla, I managed to construct a <code>vimrc</code> file exceeding one thousand lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="consistentvimrc">Consistent vimrc</h2>

<p>No point in sharing the entire collection, but here are a few illustrative examples and the rationale behind them.
Feel free to try them out, if that is your thing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Y</p>

<p>As is widely known <code>Y</code> is not consistent with other uppercase commands.
It copies the whole line while <code>D</code> and <code>C</code> operates from the cursor position to the end of line.
Simple remap fixes the issue.</p>

<pre><code>" make Y consistent with C and D.
nnoremap Y y$
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>n</code> and <code>N</code></p>

<p>Having the same characters always go in the same direction would be a lot easier.
So this map makes <code>n</code> always go forwards and <code>N</code> always go backwards<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.
Same for <code>;</code> and <code>,</code><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<pre><code>" make n always search forward and N backward
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; n 'Nn'[v:searchforward]
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; N 'nN'[v:searchforward]

" make ; always "find" forward and , backward
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; ; getcharsearch().forward ? ';' : ','
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; , getcharsearch().forward ? ',' : ';'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>;</code> and <code>,</code></p>

<p>I disliked the forward and backward <code>f</code> repetition being under different characters: <code>;</code> and <code>,</code>.
This set of remaps puts them under the same key and moves away the colon command over to backtick.
The original backtick behaviour is transferred to a single quote.</p>

<pre><code>" make ; and , be on the same key
nnoremap : ,
nnoremap ` :
nnoremap ' `
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>l</code></p>

<p>This set of mappings makes the <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>l</code> keys perform consistent direction-related action in various circumstances: scrolling, changing and creating windows, moving across paragraphs.</p>

<pre><code>" make J, K, L, and H move the cursor MORE.
nnoremap J }
nnoremap K {
nnoremap L g_
nnoremap H ^

" make &lt;c-j&gt;, &lt;c-k&gt;, &lt;c-l&gt;, and &lt;c-h&gt; scroll the screen.
nnoremap &lt;c-j&gt; &lt;c-e&gt;
nnoremap &lt;c-k&gt; &lt;c-y&gt;
nnoremap &lt;c-l&gt; zl
nnoremap &lt;c-h&gt; zh

" make &lt;a-j&gt;, &lt;a-k&gt;, &lt;a-l&gt;, and &lt;a-h&gt; move to window.
nnoremap &lt;a-j&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;j
nnoremap &lt;a-k&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;k
nnoremap &lt;a-l&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;l
nnoremap &lt;a-h&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;h

" make &lt;a-J&gt;, &lt;a-K&gt;, &lt;a-L&gt;, and &lt;a-H&gt; create windows.
nnoremap &lt;a-J&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;s&lt;c-w&gt;k
nnoremap &lt;a-K&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;s
nnoremap &lt;a-H&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;v
nnoremap &lt;a-L&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;v&lt;c-w&gt;h
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>J</code> and <code>K</code>.</p>

<p>If you think about how Vim moves across sentences and words you will notice that it doesn’t place the cursor on the empty space between them, but rather on the first and last characters.
Similarly this bad boy makes <code>J</code> and <code>K</code> commands place the cursor on the outermost lines while moving from paragraph to paragraph.
Consistent.</p>

<pre><code>" move to the edge of a paragraph.
function! s:Move(isUp, isInVisual)
  if a:isInVisual
    normal! gv
  end
  let curpos = getcurpos()
  let firstline='\(^\s*\n\)\zs\s*\S\+'
  let lastline ='\s*\S\+\ze\n\s*$'
  let flags = 'Wn'. (a:isUp ? 'b' : '')
  " Move to first or last line of paragraph, or to the beginning/end of file
  let pat = '\('.firstline.'\|'.lastline.'\)\|\%^\|\%$'
  " make sure cursor moves and search does not get stuck on current line
  call cursor(line('.'), a:isUp ? 1 : col('$'))
  let target=search(pat, flags)
  if target &gt; 0
    let curpos[1]=target
    let curpos[2]=curpos[4]
  end
  call setpos('.',curpos)
endfu

</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>ge</code></p>

<p>To understand the inconsistency with <code>ge</code> consider how Vim behaves across 4 distinct commands:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor position       Command        Result
------------------------------------------------
word1 word2           de             wo word2
  ^                   dw             woword2

word1 word2           db             word1 rd2
        ^             dge            wordd2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>dge</code> is inconsistent in two ways: first, unlike <code>db</code>, it deletes the character under the cursor; second, unlike <code>dw</code>, it deletes the last character of the word it moves towards.
Remap below made it more consistent.</p>

<pre><code>" make commands with ge consistent with b and w
onoremap ge :execute "normal! " . v:count1 . "ge&lt;space&gt;"&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>&amp;</code></p>

<p>Here remap makes the substitution repeat command reuse the flags of the previous invocation.</p>

<pre><code>" make substitution repeat to reuse last flags
nnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;cr&gt;
xnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let that be the end of examples.
I had many more but you probably get the point by now.
The simple truth is that my thousand line vimrc file didn’t give me any comfort.
The feeling I had when I opened it up is best described as a kind of anxiety.
I often felt a weird push to improve it, organize it better, make it more consistent.
Until one day I had enough and pressed delete.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="afreshstart">A fresh start</h2>

<p>So, no more vimrc.
It did feel sloppy, at first.
But I quickly found a new way to get around.</p>

<p>Some of the issues with highly customized configuration files are known to everyone.
You have to use a plugin to manage your plugins; have to transfer dotfiles across different servers; lose the ability to work on machines without your configuration files; others cannot use your computer without disabling your setup first.
Removing the heavy configuration got rid of those downsides.
But in addition I noticed a few additional less talked about benefits which are listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reduced confusion</p>

<p>When my vimrc grew, it became harder to remember all the maps and remaps that were in there.
So when adjusting configuration sometimes I would overwrite my previous mappings and other times I would apply the same “consistency fix” twice, in two slightly different ways, ending up with two different keys being remapped to the same operation.
In general changing things or reading and searching the help pages became cumbersome.</p>

<p>And proper fixes are often hard, harder than you might think.
Take even the simplest example: making <code>cw</code> consistent with <code>dw</code>.
Maybe some haven’t noticed but in Vim <code>cw</code> behaves like <code>ce</code>: it changes text to the end of the current word, not to the beginning of the next word.
It looks like an easy thing to change but the best known implementation is close to 20 lines of vimscript<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>, and there is no guarantee that it is perfect.
You always have to track various edge cases and add checks for different modes, empty lines, end of file situations.
Without such careful treatment the fix will be inconsistent itself.</p>

<p>In addition some consistency bandages themselves introduced inconsistencies in other places.
As an example take the remap between colon and comma.
Remember - I remapped colon to be consistent with semicolon and transferred the original command-line operation to backtick.
But this left <code>g;</code> and <code>g,</code> unadjusted which is, you guessed it, still inconsistent.
Even if we adjust them the <code>":</code> register is still there.
So, to redo the last command-line operation I still have to call <code>@:</code> even if my command-line operation itself is now under backtick.
Those inconsistencies never end.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased flexibility</p>

<p>I became accustomed to my simplified mappings and slowly but surely lost the ability to control more complex commands.
A good example is my <code>&lt;leader&gt;R</code> map:</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;R :belowright 20split | terminal R --no-save --no-restore&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It opened up a <code>:terminal</code> buffer below the current window, set it to 20 lines in height, and launched R in it.
Sweet little command, right?
Well yes.
But it only allowed me to open R in a fixed size window.
It somehow took away my knowledge of opening a window anywhere, in any size, and running any command in it.
I got used to this simplicity so much I was no longer able to open python in a 30 line height window without checking the syntax of my R remap in the vimrc first.</p>

<p>Using registers is another good example.
One map I had was <code>&lt;leader&gt;y</code> which copied the text into the system clipboard.
Simple, convenient, and fast.
When it was no longer there I was forced to issue the full command, which is <code>"+y</code>.
It may be slightly less convenient but seeing and using this syntax makes it clear what is going on and it naturally encourages the use of different registers.
When I got in the habit of yanking text into the <code>+</code> register my usage of custom registers became much more frequent as a side effect.
A new side of Vim, previously layered by my custom remaps, opened up and expanded.</p>

<p>Similar thing happened with yanking text and using it to replace another piece of text.
It is a common enough procedure and so I turned to plugins for help.
Using a plugin<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> was convenient.
It was so convenient that I didn’t have to think about it, just yank text, issue an operator, define a motion, and bam - the replacement took place.
After I …</p></li></ul></div>

    <div inner_tag="div"><div><div><p><strong>In the global race to measure ever shorter time spans, physicists from Goethe University Frankfurt have now taken the lead: together with colleagues at the accelerator facility DESY in Hamburg and the Fritz-Haber-Institute in Berlin, they have measured a process that lies within the realm of zeptoseconds for the first time: the propagation of light within a molecule. A zeptosecond is a trillionth of a billionth of a second (10-21 seconds).<br></strong><br>FRANKFURT. In 1999, the Egyptian chemist Ahmed Zewail received the Nobel Prize for measuring the speed at which molecules change their shape. He founded femtochemistry using ultrashort laser flashes: the formation and breakup of chemical bonds occurs in the realm of femtoseconds. A femtosecond equals 0.000000000000001 seconds, or 10-15 seconds. </p><p>Now atomic physicists at Goethe University in Professor Reinhard Dörner's team have for the first time studied a process that is shorter than femtoseconds by magnitudes. They measured how long it takes for a photon to cross a hydrogen molecule: about 247 zeptoseconds for the average bond length of the molecule. This is the shortest timespan that has been successfully measured to date.</p><p>The scientists carried out the time measurement on a hydrogen molecule (H2) which they irradiated with X-rays from the synchrotron lightsource PETRA III at the Hamburg accelerator centre DESY. The researchers set the energy of the X-rays so that one photon was sufficient to eject both electrons out of the hydrogen molecule.</p><p>Electrons behave like particles and waves simultaneously, and therefore the ejection of the first electron resulted in electron waves launched first in the one, and then in the second hydrogen molecule atom in quick succession, with the waves merging.</p><p>The photon behaved here much like a flat pebble that is skimmed twice across the water: when a&nbsp; wave trough meets a wave crest, the waves of the first and second water contact cancel each other, resulting in what is called an interference pattern.</p><p>The scientists measured the interference pattern of the first ejected electron using the COLTRIMS reaction microscope, an apparatus that Dörner helped develop and which makes ultrafast reaction processes in atoms and molecules visible. Simultaneously with the interference pattern, the COLTRIMS reactions microscope also allowed the determination of the orientation of the hydrogen molecule. The researchers here took advantage of the fact that the second electron also left the hydrogen molecule, so that the remaining hydrogen nuclei flew apart and were detected.</p><p>&nbsp;“Since we knew the spatial orientation of the hydrogen molecule, we used the interference of the two electron waves to precisely calculate when the photon reached the first and when it reached the second hydrogen atom," explains Sven Grundmann whose doctoral dissertation forms the basis of the scientific article in Science. “And this is up to 247 zeptoseconds, depending on how far apart in the molecule the two atoms were from the perspective of light."</p><p>Professor Reinhard Dörner adds: “We observed for the first time that the electron shell in a molecule does not react to light everywhere at the same time. The time delay occurs because information within the molecule only spreads at the speed of light. With this finding we have extended our COLTRIMS technology to another application."</p><p><strong>Publication: </strong>Sven Grundmann, Daniel Trabert, Kilian Fehre, Nico Strenger, Andreas Pier, Leon Kaiser, Max Kircher, Miriam Weller, Sebastian Eckart, Lothar Ph.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main id="main-content-container"><article aria-label="GDPR watchdog’s investigation finds that tracking and consent pop-ups used by Google and other major websites and apps are unlawful."><div>
<p>The Belgian Data Protection Authority (APD-GBA) has found serious GDPR infringements in the system Google and others use to legitimise online tracking. The system behind nearly all of the consent messages that pop up on screens in Europe has been found to infringe the GDPR. The APD-GBA is the lead enforcer on this issue for the EU.</p>



<p>The system is known as the “Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (TCF)”. It was introduced by the tracking industry’s standards body, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) as an attempt to convince enforcers that online advertising’s controversial “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) system was compliant with the GDPR. Google started to use the TCF this year.</p>



<p>But the IAB’s system allows companies to swap sensitive information about people, even when this has not been authorised. According to the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service, </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“IAB Europe’s approach demonstrates that it neglects the risks that would impact on the rights and freedoms of data subjects”. &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>RTB operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. It constantly broadcasts the private things that people do and watch online to tracking companies. It also tells them where we are in the real world. There is no way of limiting what then happens to any of these data.</p>



<p>Europe’s RTB advertising market was worth €6.7bn in 2019. There is no estimate of the market value of personal data gathered through the RTB system. However, publishers have been increasingly worried about the theft of their audiences through the RTB system.</p>



<p>According to the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service, the IAB does not provide adequate controls for the processing of the most intimate data, which the GDPR calls “special category” data. &nbsp;Last month the Irish Council for Civil Liberties <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/human-rights/info-privacy/rtb-data-breach-2-years-on/">revealed that RTB data was used to profile LGBT+ people to influence a national election</a>, and that RTB data had been used to profile victims of incest and sexual abuse.</p>



<p>The Belgian findings come as part of a campaign of GDPR complaints against the RTB data breach launched two years ago by <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/staff/dr-johnny-ryan/">Dr Johnny Ryan</a> of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, who was then a tech executive. He said: </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“the pop-ups that plague us tens of times a day were an attempt to paint a thin legal veneer over the vast data breach at the heart of the behavioural advertising system. The Belgian Data Protection Authority is rightly peeling this veneer off, and exposing massive illegality in online behavioural advertising”</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>United States</strong></p>



<p>The IAB offers legal guidance to the global tracking industry. In October it began to market a system based on the TCF for California’s new privacy law, the CCPA. In August, it launched the IAB Privacy Lab, to lobby lawmakers and produce variants of the TCF for regional laws.</p>



<p>But the Belgian privacy watchdog has now found that even the privacy policy on the IAB’s own website infringes the GDPR, and that the IAB has failed to appoint a data protection officer. </p>



<p>Pierre Dewitte, of the University of Leuven, a complainant, said</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“the findings about the IAB’s poor internal GDPR compliance show its lack of expertise, or interest, in the most elementary aspects of data protection and privacy law”</em>. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The Belgian authority’s report says <em>“the Inspection Service believes that IAB Europe is trying to avoid its liability to the GDPR, constituting an aggravating circumstance”</em>. </p>



<p>Ravi Naik, solicitor who worked on the original complaints, said </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“These findings are damning and overdue. As the standard setters, the IAB is responsible for breaches of the GDPR. Their supervisory authority has rightly found that the IAB “neglects” the risks to data subjects. The IAB’s responsibility now is to stop these&nbsp;breaches”</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service has forwarded its findings to the Litigation Chamber, and action will be taken in early 2021. </p>



<p>Dr Jef Ausloos, of University of Amsterdam, a complaint, said </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“I am happy to see a data protection authority resolve to take on the tracking industry. This may be the first step in taking down surveillance capitalism”. </em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Who is involved in the RTB campaign?</strong></p>



<p>There are 22 RTB complainants, individuals and organisations, in 16 EU Member States. They are Dr Johnny Ryan, Senior Fellow of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties; Jim Killock Executive Director of the Open Rights Group; Dr Michael Veale of the Turing Institute; Katarzyna Szymielewicz, CEO of the Panoptykon Foundation; Evelyn Austin, Director of Bits of Freedom; Gemma Galdon Clavell, CEO of the Eticas Foundation; Jose Belo; Dr Jef Ausloos of the University of Amsterdam; Pierre Dewitte of the University of Leuven; Liberties.eu; the Society for Civil Rights; Digitale courage; Ligue des droits humains; Digitale Gesellschaft; Netzwerk Datenschutzexpertise; Deutsche Vereinigung für Datenschutz; the Italian Coalition for Civil Rights and Freedoms; the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee; the Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Romania; the Italian Coalition for Civil Rights and Freedoms; the Estonian Human Rights Centre; the Peace Institute.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October, 2020, Hugo Xu (a.k.a. "jspenguin2017") <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362">announced</a> he had sold Nano to "a team of Turkish developers". No further information was posted.</p>
<p>This immediately aroused suspicion. Who <em>are</em> these "Turkish developers"? Who controls the code? Why has the Privacy Policy been removed?</p>
<p>Fast forward 12 days later, Raymond Hill (developer of uBlock Origin) started to <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362#issuecomment-709428210">dig deeper</a>. Raymond inspected the modifications added by the new developers (which was not published to GitHub), revealing their dubious intentions.</p>
<p>The extension transmits your data to an <a href="https://def.dev-nano.com/">unknown server</a>, sending information about web requests (which may contain confidential information). This is a backdoor, and presents a <em>major</em> privacy risk to users of the Nano suite.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after, these same "Turkish developers" published a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nano-dev">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Despite working <em>without</em> collecting data, the new Nano developers have chosen to collect the following data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your IP Address,</li>
<li>Your Country,</li>
<li>URL's,</li>
<li>Time of your web requests,</li>
<li>HTTP Methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">(POST, GET, HEAD, etc.)</a></li>
<li>Size of HTTP Responses,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Response_codes">(HTTP Status Response Codes)</a></li>
<li>Your Operating System and "other parameters about the device operating system and/or the User's IT environment",</li>
<li>Time spent on each web page,</li>
<li>URL's navigated in the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that's not enough, the new developers have not released an official statement.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, what can you do? Remove this extension <strong>immediately!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation">uBlock Origin</a> is a fine alternative to Nano.</p>
<p>It comes with greater stability, many more contributors, and no data collection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember to audit your extensions frequently, and remove any unused extensions.</p>
<p>In the case of Nano Defender, users were not notified before control of the extension was transferred to a third-party. That's not the right way to handle this.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we can learn from this and move forward.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I've just been told that LiCybora, the author of the Firefox Nano extensions, has full control over the Firefox extensions. <a href="https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoDefenderFirefox/issues/187">They're safe for now.</a></p>

       <p>It’s been 13 years since Yudkowsky published the sequences, and 11 years since he wrote “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning">Rationality is Systematized Winning</a>“.</p>
<p>So where are all the winners?</p>
<p>The people that jump to mind are Nick Bostrom (Oxford Professor of Philosophy, author), Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld (run OpenPhil and GiveWell, directing ~300M in annual donations) and Will MacAskill (Oxford Professor of Philosophy, author).</p>
<p>But somehow that feels like cheating. We know rationalism is a good meme, so it doesn’t seem fair to cite people whose accomplishments are largely built off of convincing someone else that rationalism is important. They’re successful, but at a meta-level, only in the same way Steve Bannon is successful, and to a much lesser extent.</p>
<p>By comparison, Miyamoto Musashi, who Yudkowsky quotes extensively in the post, and who coined the phrase “the Ichi school is the spirit of winning”, appears to have been one of the greatest swordsmen of his era. According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi#First_duel">Wikipedia</a>, he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fought duels against the most famous schools in Kyoto, and never lost</li>
<li>Defeated an “adept” at age 13</li>
<li>Was granted the title “Unrivaled Under Heaven” by the shogun at 21</li>

</ul>
<p>One explanation is that rationalism entails a particular value system that guides rationalists away from becoming prominent politicians or entrepreneurs. This isn’t obviously absurd. Very successful people are often described as ambitious, smart and hardworking, but rarely as intellectually honest. Analogously, Ecclesiastical orders often had the highest literacy rates, but had philosophical objections to using that leverage to gain influence in other spheres.</p>
<p>Except that they totally did anyway. Pope Urban II initiated the crusades, a holy war of massive proportions. Pope Clement VII was so influential that King Henry VIII had to leave the church and invent in Anglicanism just to escape. And Pope Innocent III claimed influence over all the kings of Europe, single handedly annulled the Magna Carta, and in an act of nominative anti-determinism, directed the sack of Constantiple.</p>
<p>Even today, churches are enormously powerful and wealthy. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#:~:text=After%20the%20Time%20article%20was,at%20%2425%20to%20%2430%20billion.">LDS</a> has an estimated $5B in annual revenue, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mormon-church-amassed-100-billion-it-was-the-best-kept-secret-in-the-investment-world-11581138011">an estimated $100B</a> in funds, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_affiliations_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#:~:text=Almost%20all%20of%20the%20presidents,Presbyterians%20being%20the%20most%20prevalent.">protestants can make claims to nearly every US president</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you think rationalism is genuinely rooted in altruism, they strongly recommend “earning to give”, which ought to result in rationalists leading hedge funds, startups and so on.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen once <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15122162/tyler-cowen-ezra-klein-interview-podcast">called rationalism</a> “just another kind of religion”, but if so, it seems to be a fairly unsuccessful one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Still, no one can deny that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/">they have noticed the skulls</a>. Whatever criticism one makes of rationalists, they have likely made of themselves many times over.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Systematised Winning, Scott Alexander wrote <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LgavAYtzFQZKg95WC/extreme-rationality-it-s-not-that-great">Extreme Rationality: It’s Not That Great</a> claiming that there is “approximately zero empirical evidence that x-rationality has a large effect on your practical success”, and giving several possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness of will: Even with good ideas, rationalists can’t execute</li>
<li>Specific knowledge beats out generalized theoretical knowledge</li>
<li>Noise</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is particularly interesting, Scott goes on to say that “people in finance tend to know this and use specially developed x-rationalist techniques on the job already without making it a lifestyle commitment.” In addition to specialization, practitioners have the benefit of learning a system of practice built by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html">tradition smarter than you</a>. A person can compete against their own irrational self, but they shouldn’t expect to win against a centuries old practice.</p>
<p>What about dynamic fields, or new fields without precedent?</p>
<p>Many startup CEOs are young generalists who did not learn their craft through a career at McKinsey or an MBA program at Harvard. It’s not clear that tech entrepreneurship has a storied tradition of practice, aside from maybe the abundance of podcasts free to all.</p>
<p>A better excuse is that startup founders are just totally insane, in a way that precludes any rational or even rationalist person from joining their ranks. Elon Musk famously compared entrepreneurship to “chewing glass and staring into the abyss”; Paul Graham warned “If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine”.</p>
<p>That’s the best case scenario where things go according to plan. The much more likely outcome is that you stagnate for years, raise money from, hire or alienate all your friends, are resented by every employee you sold on a billion dollar exit, who by the way, are the only people you ever see, all while sacrificing your physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>This should also be considered against a very high baseline quality of life. The alternative to running a tech company isn’t the median human existence, it’s being an incredibly well paid engineer or tech executive and retiring in your 30s.</p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of baselines, what exactly should we expect from the rationalist community?</p>
<p>If it was a bunch of uneducated basement dwellers, we shouldn’t be shocked to learn that rationalism was unable to transform them into heads of state and captains of industry.</p>
<p>But the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/2019%20SSC%20Survey.html">SCC survey results</a> paint a different picture. Over 40% of readers work in software engineering, IT, and computer science, with another 4.7% in finance and 3% in physics, 6.7% in engineering, and 3.8% in law. 12% have PhDs, another 25% have Master’s degrees, and another 40% have Bachelor’s.</p>
<p>All else equal, we should expect these people to do fairly well, or at least have the potential to once imbued with some kind of cognitive superpower.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two possible conspiratorial views:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The world is run by rationalists, but you haven’t heard of them. From an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/15/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-years-in-an-alternate-universe/">earlier SSC post</a>:&nbsp; “large organizations tend to have a position that pretty much controls everything from behind the scenes but doesn’t have to cope with the appearance of power”</p>
</li>
<li><p>The world is run by rationalists, but they haven’t outed themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As with all conspiracies, these views are not only crazy, but also unfalsifiable. I could just as easily claim that the world is secretly run by freemasons. From a Bayesian perspective, the evidence is equally well explained by the both hypotheses, so we should stick with our prior that there is not a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Instead, I propose the weak conspiracy, which is that many successful people have read rationalist blogs, but do not make it part of their identity. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyler Cowen: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15122162/tyler-cowen-ezra-klein-interview-podcast">I enjoy all those sources, and I read them. That’s obviously a kind of endorsement.</a>“</li>
<li>Paul Graham: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/909070952465600512">There’s no one writing now that I admire more than Scott Alexander</a>“</li>
<li>Matt Levine: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/795743276036923392">Does anyone else think about this [SSC] article every day?</a>“</li>
<li>Patrick Collison: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1005903040115814400">…Scott Alexander’s deservedly famous Meditations on Moloch</a>“</li>
<li>Steven Pinker: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1275406500492697601?lang=en">Tragedy in the blogosphere: One of the best [SSC] is being taken down.</a>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, now the question is: “do rationalists become successful, or do successful people just like blogs on the internet?” We might try to infer causality from timing. As of 2009, every one of those people was already successful, which points in favor of the latter hypothesis.</p>
<hr>
<p>Instead of more theorizing, I’ll end by offering my own testimony.</p>
<p>The primary impacts of reading rationalist blogs are that 1) I have been frequently distracted at work, and 2) my conversations have gotten much worse. Talking to non-rationalists, I am perpetually holding myself back from saying “oh yes, that’s just the thing where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/01/is-it-possible-to-have-coherent-principles-around-free-speech-norms/">no one has coherent</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">meta-principles</a>“ or “that’s the thing where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://meaningness.com/eggplant/refrigerator">facts are purpose-dependent</a>“. Talking to rationalists is not much better, since it feels less like a free exchange of ideas, and more like an exchange of “have you read <x> post?”</x></p>
<p>There are some specific areas where rationality might help, like using Yudkowsky’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> to know when it’s plausible to think I have an original insight that is not already “priced into the market”, but even here, I’m not convinced these beat out specific knowledge. If you want to start a defensible monopoly, reading about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2018/07/29/mind-the-moat-a-7-powers-review/">business strategy</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup">startup-specific strategy</a> will probably be more useful than trying to reason about “efficiency” in a totally abstract sense.</p>
<p>And yet, I will continue reading these blogs, and if Slate Star Codex ever releases a new post, I will likely drop whatever I am doing to read it. This has nothing to do with self-improvement or “systematized winning”.</p>
<p>It’s solely because weird blogs on the internet make me feel less alone.</p>
<p>Before reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human's_Guide_to_Words">A Human’s Guide to Words</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">The Categories Were Made For Man</a>, I went around thinking “oh god, no one is using language coherently, and I seem to be the only one seeing it, but I cannot even express my horror in a comprehensible way.” This felt like a hellish combination of being trapped in an illusion, questioning my own sanity, and simultaneously being unable to scream. For years, I wondered if I was just uniquely broken, and living in a reality that no one else seemed to see or understand.</p>
<p>So the defense of “rationality as systematized winning” is not even a causal one. I don’t claim to have benefited in any real way from rationality, nor can I really recommend it to anyone who isn’t already inclined to read these blogs. The point of winning is not to make money, or gain influence, or even to altruistically produce more QALYs. The point is that for my reality to even feel legitimate, it needs to have bearing on the consensus shared reality.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that Slate Star Codex is gone, this project feels more necessary than ever. Substack promised to fund independent writing, but instead, has largely replaced eclectic blogs with rapid-fire newsletters that follow the news-cycle. The kinds of people who would have been rationalist writers are instead mass-producing insight-porn on Twitter, or starting Progress Studies blogs to share historical trivia.</p>
<p>A smart person would take this …</p></div></div>

       <p>Last night, my earlier post on polymaths was featured on Marginal Revolution. What followed were some of the nicest comments I’ve ever seen on the internet:</p>
<p>Over email</p>
<ul>
<li>I came across your blog after seeing the recommendation in Tyler Cowen’s post. I accidentally read (almost) every post. I admire your writing style.</li>
<li>I’m very curious who you are and what you do. I love your blog—it’s brilliant—and would like to work with you in some professional capacity.</li>
<li>I enjoy the way you think and the way you write, so you have my email.</li>
</ul>
<p>And from the comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just in case you haven’t clicked on the link above labeled “Beware the Casual Polymath, it takes you to a blog called Applied Divinity Studies that is really terrific. Highly recommended!</li>
<li>“From Beware the Casual Polymath (excellent link btw):”</li>
</ul>
<p>Around 9 hours later, it was reposted to Hacker News where it’s accrued 150 points and 75 comments. Some of them are mean, but the real surprise is that many of them accuse me of being a bot. In other words, I fail the Turing test.</p>
<p>Over email:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you tell me how you’re doing it? A retrieval-based language model, perhaps?</li>
</ul>
<p>And from the comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m about 95% certain this article was written with GPT or some similar algorithm.</li>
<li>Probably machine generated.</li>
<li>Would a human write that crap or are you shouting at a computer generated thingie?</li>
<li>It’s absolute rubbish. This is an experiment.</li>
<li>This looks like an experiment. Please de-cloak and explain.</li>
<li>Assuming this isn’t some GPT-3 garbage, why does any of this matter?<br>This is an experiment (I think) along the lines of the Turing test.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t spend enough time on Hacker News to know if this is a common reaction or if there’s something uniquely bot-like about my writing. Maybe the unintended consequence of GPT-3 is that it makes people deeply distrustful of each other.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, 5 of the 8 comments are from the same user. In one sense, this is comforting, at least there are fewer people. But in another sense, it’s much more worrying. When it comes to negative reactions, I would rather have 8 mild ones than 1 strong one.</p>

			<strong>UZH researchers have investigated ancient leather balls discovered in the graves of horse riders in northwest China. According to the international research team, they are around 3,000 years old, making them the oldest balls in Eurasia. The find suggests amongst others that the mounted warriors of Central Asia played ball games to keep themselves fit.</strong>

		<div><p>Today, ball games are one of the most popular leisure activities in the world, an important form of mass entertainment and big business. But who invented balls, where and when? The oldest balls that are currently known about were made in Egypt about 4,500 years ago using linen. Central Americans have been playing ball games for at least 3,700 years, as evidenced through monumental ball courts made of stone and depictions of ball players. Their oldest balls were made of rubber. Until now, it was believed that ball games in Europe and Asia followed much later: In Greece about 2,500 years ago and in China about 300 years after that.</p>

<h3>Eurasia’s oldest known balls</h3>

<p>Researchers from the University of Zurich, together with German and Chinese researchers, have now examined in more detail three leather balls found in graves in the old Yanghai cemetery near the city of Turfan in northwest China. The balls, measuring between 7.4 and 9.2cm in diameter, have been dated at around 2,900 to 3,200 years old. “This makes these balls about five centuries older than the previously known ancient balls and depictions of ball games in Eurasia,” says first author Patrick Wertmann of the Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies of the University of Zurich. “Unfortunately, however, the associated archaeological information is not sufficient to answer the question of exactly how these balls were played.”</p>

<p>The earliest illustrations from Greece show ball players running, and depictions from China show riders using sticks. Comparable curved sticks were also found in Yanghai, but there was no apparent direct connection with the balls. Moreover, they are dated to a more recent period. “Therefore, the leather balls from Yanghai are not connected to early forms of field hockey or polo, even though two of the balls were found in the graves of horsemen,” says Wertmann.</p>

<h3>New era of Central Asian equestrian warfare</h3>

<p>In one of the riders’ graves, the preserved remains of a composite bow and a pair of trousers (1) were found, which were made in the region at that time and are among the oldest in the world. Both are signs of a new era of horse riding, equestrian warfare and fundamental societal transformations which accompanied increasing environmental changes and a rising mobility in eastern Central Asia. The current study shows that balls and ball games were part of physical exercise and military training from the very beginning. In addition, just like today, sport also played a central role in society and was a widespread leisure activity. The study’s findings once again highlight that this region was a center of innovation within Eurasia several millennia ago.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After I published my $1 MCU write-up, several readers suggested I look at application processors — the MMU-endowed chips necessary to run real operating systems like Linux. Massive shifts over the last few years have seen internet-connected devices become more featureful (and hopefully, more secure), and I’m finding myself putting Linux into more and more places.</p><p>Among beginner engineers, application processors supplicate reverence: one minor PCB bug and your $10,000 prototype becomes a paperweight. There’s an occult consortium of engineering pros who drop these chips into designs with utter confidence, while the uninitiated cower for their Raspberry Pis and overpriced industrial SOMs.</p><p>This article is targeted at embedded engineers who are familiar with microcontrollers but not with microprocessors or Linux, so I wanted to put together something with a quick primer on why you’d want to run embedded Linux, a broad overview of what’s involved in designing around application processors, and then a dive into some specific parts you should check out — and others you should avoid — for entry-level embedded Linux systems.</p><p>Just like my microcontroller article, the parts I picked range from the well-worn horses that have pulled along products for the better part of this decade, to fresh-faced ICs with intriguing capabilities that you can keep up your sleeve.</p><p>If my mantra for the microcontroller article was that you should pick the right part for the job and not be afraid to learn new software ecosystems, my argument for this post is even simpler: once you’re booted into Linux on basically <em>any</em> of these parts, they become identical development environments.</p><p>That makes chips running embedded Linux almost a commodity product: as long as your processor checks off the right boxes, your application code won’t know if it’s running on an ST or a Microchip part — even if one of those is a brand-new dual-core Cortex-A7 and the other is an old ARM9. Your I2C drivers, your GPIO calls — even your V4L-based image processing code — will all work seamlessly.</p><p>At least, that’s the sales pitch. Getting a part booted is an entirely different ordeal altogether — that’s what we’ll be focused on. Except for some minor benchmarking at the end, once we get to a shell prompt, we’ll consider the job completed.</p><p>As a departure from my microcontroller review, this time I’m focusing heavily on hardware design: unlike the microcontrollers I reviewed, these chips vary considerably in PCB design difficulty — a discussion I would be in error to omit. To this end, I designed a dev board from scratch for each application processor reviewed. Well, actually, <em>many</em> dev boards for each processor: roughly 25 different designs in total. This allowed me to try out different DDR layout and power management strategies — as well as fix some bugs along the way.</p><p>I intentionally designed these boards from scratch rather than starting with someone else’s CAD files. This helped me discover little “gotchas” that each CPU has, as well as optimize the design for cost and hand-assembly. Each of these boards was designed across one or two days’ worth of time and used JLC’s low-cost 4-layer PCB manufacturing service.</p><p>These boards won’t win any awards for power consumption or EMC: to keep things easy, I often cheated by combining power rails together that would typically be powered (and sequenced!) separately. Also, I limited the on-board peripherals to the bare minimum required to boot, so there are no audio CODECs, little I2C sensors, or Ethernet PHYs on these boards.</p><p id="differences">As a result, the boards I built for this review are akin to the notes from your high school history class or a recording you made of yourself practicing a piece of music to study later. So while I’ll post pictures of the boards and screenshots of layouts to illustrate specific points, these aren’t intended to serve as reference designs or anything; the whole point of the review is to get you to a spot where you’ll want to go off and design <em>your own</em> little Linux boards. Teach a person to fish, you know?</p><h2>Microcontroller vs Microprocessor: Differences</h2><p>Coming from microcontrollers, the first thing you’ll notice is that Linux doesn’t usually run on Cortex-M, 8051, AVR, or other popular microcontroller architectures. Instead, we use <em>application processors</em> — popular ones are the Arm Cortex-A, ARM926EJ-S, and several MIPS iterations.</p><p>The biggest difference between these application processors and a microcontroller is quite simple: microprocessors have a memory management unit (MMU), and microcontrollers don’t. Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CClinux">you can run Linux without an MMU</a>, but you usually shouldn’t: Cortex-M7 parts that can barely hit 500 MHz routinely go for double or quadruple the price of faster Cortex-A7s. They’re power-hungry: microcontrollers are built on larger processes than application processors to reduce their leakage current. And without an MMU and generally-low clock speeds, they’re downright slow.</p><p id="why">Other than the MMU, the lines between MCUs and MPUs are getting blurred. Modern application processors often feature a similar peripheral complement as microcontrollers, and high-end Cortex-M7 microcontrollers often have similar clock speeds as entry-level application processors.</p><h2>Why would you want to Linux?</h2><p>When your microcontroller project outgrows its super loop and the random ISRs you’ve sprinkled throughout your code with care, there are many bare-metal tasking kernels to turn to — <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/">FreeRTOS</a>, ThreadX (now <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/rtos/">Azure RTOS</a>), <a href="https://www.rt-thread.io/">RT-Thread</a>, <a href="https://www.micrium.com/rtos/kernels/">μC/OS</a>, etc. By an academic definition, these are operating systems. However, compared to Linux, it’s more useful to think of these as a framework you use to write your bare-metal application inside. They provide the core components of an operating system: threads (and obviously a scheduler), semaphores, message-passing, and events. Some of these also have networking, filesystems, and other libraries.</p><p>Comparing bare-metal RTOSs to Linux simply comes down to the fundamental difference <em>between </em>these and Linux: memory management and protection. This one technical difference makes Linux running on an application processor behave quite differently from your microcontroller running an RTOS.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1');">1</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1">Before the RTOS snobs attack with pitchforks, yes, there are large-scale, well-tested RTOSes that are usually run on application processors with memory management units. Look at <a href="https://www.rtems.org/">RTEMS</a> as an example. They don’t have some of the limitations discussed below, and have many advantages over Linux for safety-critical real-time applications.</span></p><h4>Dynamic memory allocation</h4><p>Small microcontroller applications can usually get by with static allocations for everything, but as your application grows, you’ll find yourself calling malloc() more and more, and that’s when weird bugs will start creeping up in your application. With complex, long-running systems, you’ll notice things working 95% of the time — only to crash at random (and usually inopportune) times. These bugs evade the most javertian developers, and in my experience, they almost always stem from memory allocation issues: usually either memory leaks (that can be fixed with appropriate free() calls), or more serious problems like memory fragmentation (when the allocator runs out of appropriately-sized free blocks).</p><p>Because Linux-capable application processors have a memory management unit, *alloc() calls execute swiftly and reliably. Physical memory is only reserved (<em>faulted in</em>) when you actually access a memory location. Memory fragmentation is much less an issue since Linux frees and reorganizes pages behind the scenes. Plus, switching to Linux provides easier-to-use diagnostic tools (like <a href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a>) to catch bugs in your application code in the first place. And finally, because applications run in virtual memory, if your app <em>does</em> have memory bugs in it, Linux will kill it — leaving the rest of your system running. <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2');">2</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2">As a last-ditch kludge, it’s not uncommon to call your app in a superloop shell script to automatically restart it if it crashes without having to restart the entire system.</span></p><h4>Networking &amp; Interoperability</h4><p>Running something like lwIP under FreeRTOS on a bare-metal microcontroller is acceptable for a lot of simple applications, but application-level network services like HTTP can burden you to implement in a reliable fashion. Stuff that seems simple to a desktop programmer — like a WebSockets server that can accept multiple simultaneous connections — can be tricky to implement in bare-metal network stacks. Because C doesn’t have good programming constructs for asynchronous calls or exceptions, code tends to contain either a lot of weird state machines or tons of nested branches. It’s horrible to debug problems that occur. In Linux, you get a first-class network stack, plus tons of rock-solid userspace libraries that sit on top of that stack and provide application-level network connectivity. Plus, you can use a variety of high-level programming languages that are easier to handle the asynchronous nature of networking.</p><p>Somewhat related is the rest of the standards-based communication / interface frameworks built into the kernel. I2S, parallel camera interfaces, RGB LCDs, SDIO, and basically all those other scary high-bandwidth interfaces seem to come together much faster when you’re in Linux. But the big one is USB host capabilities. On Linux, USB devices <em>just work</em>. If your touchscreen drivers are glitching out and you have a client demo to show off in a half-hour, just plug in a USB mouse until you can fix it (I’ve been there before). Product requirements change and now you need audio? Grab a $20 USB dongle until you can respin the board with a proper audio codec. On many boards without Ethernet, I just use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter to allow remote file transfer and GDB debugging. Don’t forget that, at the end of the day, an embedded Linux system is shockingly similar to your computer.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>When thinking about embedded device security, there are usually two things we’re talking about: device …</p></div></div></div>

					        			<p>Posted by Paul on January 29, 2017</p>		
        		</div><div>
        			<p><strong>Back in 2007 I was very excited to start reading <em>The Singularity is Near</em> by Ray Kurzweil which had been published 2 years earlier in 2005. As someone who'd always been fascinated by computers and technology since I started programming my first ZX Spectrum as a child, through to my teenage years programming in QBASIC, to my work as a Web Developer, I was well aware of Moore's law and very conscious of the accelerating progress in technology.</strong></p>
<p>As I started to read, it became clear that this was an exceptional book. The clarity of Kurzweil's writing, the level of detail he went in to about each concept he discussed and the content itself were entirely captivating, not least because the predictions were set to happen in the near future and would change the world in to an unrecognisable utopia. In fact, although Kurzweil says early on in the book that his view of the future is neither utopian nor dystopian, the future described is so rosy that the Singularity has also been called "the Geeks' Rapture".</p>
<p>Indeed, if Kurzweil's predictions do come true, they are comparible in their size and implications to the Second Coming of Jesus - the conquering of death and the unification of all consciousness in to one computational substrate that is to become more powerful than anything in the Universe and spreads outward from the Earth at the speed of light ... or faster!</p>
<p>The book quickly became an absolute page-turner for me and as incredulous as it sounded, Kurzweil backed up every prediction with thorough research, logic, and his own impressive credentials - Kurzweil was something of a child prodigy who programmed computers and wrote scientific papers at an early age and became the inventor of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and the Kurzweil digital pianos and keyboards that bear his name. Kurzweil now works at Google where his job description is "to bring natural language understanding to Google" - a goal not too distant from developing an AI capable of passing the Turing test.</p>
<p>During my time as a software developer, discussions often arose about the future of technology and I would occasionally lend the book to other developers. Unfortunately, at some point the book wasn't returned and I wasn't too fussed as I'd already read it thoroughly. Recently, I decided to buy another copy and re-read it - after all, I still consider it to be one of the best books I've ever read. This time though, 12 years after the initial publication, it would be possible to see how Kurzweil's predictions had done.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Kurzweil himself has released a document describing how his predictions are faring which can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately though, he doesn't always seem to be intellectually honest with himself:</p>
<div><p>"PREDICTION<br>Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas.</p><p>ACCURACY <br>Essentially correct</p></div>
<p>In The Singularity is Near, the wording could be interpreted to mean that it is commonly <br>used, which is not yet the case, but this is likely to become the case over the next couple <br>of years."</p>
<p>Well that was 2010, it's now 2017 - where are these eyeglasses and contact lenses? What about Google Glass? Well it may still be being developed, but it certainly isn't in common use. Kurzweil also tends to mark many of his other predictions as "correct", when really they're not, even now in 2017.</p>
<p>So, let's get on to my re-reading of <em>The Singularity is Near</em>, which even for the second time I thoroughly enjoyed and took away a load more fascinating information that I may have missed on the first reading. This time I noted any predictions as I went through that we can now verify and what I found is below.</p>
<h2>On pages 11 and 12 we have:</h2>
<p>"James Watson, the codiscoverer of DNA, said that in fifty years we will have drugs that will allow us to eat as much as we want without gaining weight.<br>I replied, 'Fifty years?' We have accomplished this already in mice by blocking the fat insulin receptor gene that controls the storage of fat in the fat cells. Drugs for human use ... are in development now and will be in FDA tests in several years. These will be available in five to ten years, not fifty."</p>
<p>Well, <em>The Singularity is Near</em> was published in 2005, so Kurzweil's deadline for this was 2015. According to the NHS website however, 1,316 gastrc band operations were performed in 2012 and today we still don't have a pill that you can take and then eat what you want. It would be unfair of me not to mention an article on Kurzweil's site: <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/imaginary-meal-tricks-the-body-into-losing-weight" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/imaginary-meal-tricks-the-body-into-losing-weight</a> but this has only been tested in mice which Kurzweil even says on p11 had already been achieved. I'm sure Kurzweil would disagree, but if we're being honest, there is still no magic pill available that lets us eat what we want and not gain weight.</p>
<p>Prediction: False</p>
<h2>Page 105</h2>
<p>"By the end of this decade, computers will disappear as distinct physical objects, with displays built in our eyeglasses, and electronics woven in our clothing, providing full-immersion visual virtual reality. Thus, 'going to a Web site' will mean entering a virtual-reality environment - at least for the visual and auditory senses - where we can directly interact with products and people, both real and simulated. Although simulated people will not be up to human standards - at least not by 2009 - they will be quite satisfactory as sales agents, reservation clerks, and research assistants. Haptic (tactile) interfaces will enable us to touch products and people. It is difficult to identify any lasting advantage of the old brick-and-mortar world that will not ultimately be overcome by the rich interactive interfaces that are soon to come."</p>
<p>Did the above sound anything like your experience of 2009? Because it doesn't seem anything like my experience of 2017. There are a few separate claims here, let's break them down:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Computers will disappear in to clothes and eyeglasses."<br>Nope. Computers have become our smart phones though and we're no longer tied to desktops.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Going to a website will mean entering virtual reality."<br>In 2009, no. In 2017, it is possible that a tiny percentage (and we're talking &lt; 0.0001%) of websites use VR and probably a similar percentage of people have an Oculus, Vive, Google Cardboard, Gear VR or similar VR headset. There is a framework to allow developers to make VR websites called <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> but it's definitely not in common use yet.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Virtual assistants will be satisfactory sales agents."<br>Nope, not in 2009 and not now in 2017. The closest we get is a live chat that is a bot, but as soon as the user realises they're not speaking to a real person, and that is pretty much after the very first question, they would usually rather just use a search or browse an FAQ.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Touch interfaces will allow us to touch products and people."<br>Sure this has existed in labs for a long time, but do we use this even in 2017? Nope, not even close. Yet another fail for Kurzweil, if we're honest.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Page 312</h2>
<p>"Computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment. They will tap into the worldwide mesh (what the World Wide Web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating Web servers, thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks) of high-speed communications and computational resources. We'll have very high-bandwidth, wireless communication to the Internet at all times. Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas."</p>
<ul>
<li>"Computers in clothing, furniture and the environment."<br>Well I have a Christmas jumper with flashing LEDs but I don't think that's what Kurzweil meant, and none of my furniture has a computer in it unless you count the Raspberry Pi on the shelf of my coffee table. As above, this one doesn't seem correct even in 2017. <p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"A worldwide mesh will link all devices"<br>Many devices do connect to wifi and you can connect to their IP address to access a config page served by their web server, so this seems to be correct. <p>Prediction: True</p></li>
<li>"forming vast supercomputers and memory banks"<br>In the PDF linked to above, Kurzweil tries to claim he meant the Cloud, but actually I think it's clear from the text that he meant all devices that connect to the Internet will share their resources in terms of memory and processing power. While this probably will happen fairly soon in my opinion and I run the "<a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding @ Home</a>" software which donates spare processor time to scientists who are trying to solve cancer and Alzheimer's, and can run on a mobile device, this isn't in common use yet in 2017.<p>Prediction: False</p><p>[Update 2017-12-22]<br>Rather than a single standard for devices to share their computing resources, it might be that blockchain technology allows these resources to be shared safely and anonymously in return for a reward such as cash, cryptocurrency or the use of other resources. Some technologies now exist that share processing such as <a href="https://golem.network/" target="_blank">Golem</a> and storage such as <a href="https://sia.tech/" target="_blank">Sia</a>. If these became ubiquitous and ran on the majority of devices, the amount of computing power available would probably be many orders of magnitude greater than even the most powerful supercomputers in existence today. </p></li>
<li>"We'll have very high-bandwidth, wireless communication to the Internet at all times."<br>Correct! Indeed we do, and we use it so much that it's hard to remember that in 2005, we didn't have this.<p>Prediction: True</p></li>
<li>"Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas."<br>Also discussed above, this one seems way off.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Still talking about "The 2010 Scenario", Kurzweil continues on page 313:</h2>
<p>"These resources will …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Elroy is a table lamp with a unique feature — the shade can dynamically change, at the swipe of a finger, to a new style or pattern to complement your mood, the time of day, or an event, all from your phone or web browser.</span></p>
<p><span>Elroy is a concept and personal DIY project. I’ll share some learnings and details on how I built it. These aren’t step-by-step instructions, but I hope they’ll be helpful to anyone that’s inspired to build their own design.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/elroy-lamp-4c_moment-5/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><span>Elroy is essentially a computer with a 4-way display, backlit by a bright LED bulb. The four sides of the lamp shade are made from translucent LCD displays, and acrylic and paper diffusion layers. The light source is a very bright 35W LED bulb. The displays are driven by a single board computer running Linux and custom software to display and manage images. The lamp is controllable over wifi via a simple web app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Translucent LCDs</strong></h3>
<p><span>I salvaged some 13” LCD displays from old laptops and found additional matching displays on ebay. I disassembled each display, removing the frame, backing layer, diffusion film, and backlight. This took some practice to get right. The LCD glass is quite fragile. I broke 2 panels during disassembly and had to find replacements. The trick is to remove the electrical tape that holds the display together without flexing the LCD glass so much that it cracks.</span></p>

Some other LCD panels use a cold florescent tube instead of LEDs.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The remaining LCD panel is translucent: LCD displays are a sandwich of transparent glass embedded with liquid crystals and tiny transistors, surrounded by layers of polarizing film. In the photo below, I wrote a message on a piece of letter paper, placed it on a clear piece of acrylic, on top of a bright backlight. You can see the LCD display on the right is translucent, but similar to a pair of sunglasses, the polarizing film only permits a fraction of the backlight to emit through the panel.</span></p>

<p><span>Polarizing film is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"><span>necessary for the function of an LCD display</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lamp Light &amp; Diffusion</strong></h3>
<p><span>Given the low amount of light emitted through the display, to create a sufficiently bright lamp, a very bright light source is needed. Also, though an LCD display is typically backlit by a light with a cold color temperature (around 5000K), lamp light is typically a warm color temperature (like 2700K). So the ideal bulb must be bright and warm.</span></p>

<p><span>I experimented with multi-bulb arrays, and different bulb options, but settled on this 35W (300W equiv) LED bulb. This bulb is giant and takes up quite a bit of space within the shade. It’s bright enough that it shouldn’t be directly exposed — it would be uncomfortable (maybe dangerous?) to look at directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, without some work, the light from the bulb, when viewed through the LCD panels, would be a harsh point-light concentrated in the center. </span><span>I wanted to diffuse the light evenly across the surface and produce a textured, fabric-like aesthetic. I experimented with different acrylic and polycarbonate sheets and paper materials.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s one experiment result I really liked, but didn’t end up using. This is mulberry paper, which has a unique texture that’s simultaneously woody and linen-like, has nice diffusion properties, and transmits a lot of light. This looked great with black and white patterns and particularly complemented a Japanese lantern aesthetic. I felt like the large and non-uniform fibers didn’t work as well with a diverse set of patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>I found the best combination was this sandwich (starting from the inside):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Frosted acrylic 1/8″ 90% emission (film facing out)</span></li>
<li><span>Vellum tracing paper</span></li>

<p><span>The acrylic and polycarbonate sheets also add some structure to protect the LCD glass from flexing and breaking. I wrapped the edges of each sandwich in acetate cloth electrical tape to keep the sheets together.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Controlling</strong></h3>
<p><span>I needed a small SBC (single-board computer), capable of driving 4 displays. I happened to have an Nvidia Jetson Nano, which has DisplayPort 1.2 output with support for MST (multi-stream transport), which means it’s able to drive multiple displays. The Jetson Nano is a powerful, tiny computer that operates on 5V power and can run a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_20191102-204056-576x1024.png" alt="" width="400" height="711" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_20191102-204056-576x1024.png 576w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_20191102-204056-169x300.png 169w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_20191102-204056-768x1365.png 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_20191102-204056.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p><span>I wrote some custom software based on </span><a href="https://www.pygame.org/"><span>Pygame</span></a><span> to display images, with a simple web app and server to give me control over the images.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="409" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg 294w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-768x785.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-1002x1024.jpg 1002w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p><span>The LCD panels take EDP (Embedded DisplayPort) video input. Each display required an adapter from DisplayPort to EDP. These adapters are bulky and have a lot of functionality I didn’t actually need, like 12V power and brightness control for a backlight (which I removed from each panel) and a control interface for display settings. I also needed an MST Hub to break out 4 DP ports from the 1 DP port on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. This configuration is something I think I could make cheaper and more compact in a future revision, but it worked great for this concept.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Woodwork</strong></h3>
<p><span>I designed the lamp structure in Rhino3D and chose to make wooden parts from walnut. This makes the shade rather heavy, but the lamp is stable with the walnut base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692"><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/img_20190608_172549/" rel="attachment wp-att-692"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-692">The shade frame, glued-up, sanded, and ready to stain.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>I cut all parts for the shade and base, then shaped them on a router table. I’m not an experienced woodworker, but this came together pretty easily. I had an adventure making tongue-and-groove joints for the first time. This is the 3rd time I’ve used walnut for a project and I always like the result.</span></p>
<p><span>The side-edges of the frame have brass threaded inserts that enable the top and bottom to attach via M2 machine screws.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3D Printed Parts</strong></h3>
<p><span>Most of the electronic components, including the power supply, SBC, MST Hub, switches, and wiring are mounted in a 4.5” square 3D printed “sleeve” that fits inside the walnut base. There is also a vented platform that connects the sleeve to the bottom of the shade.</span></p>

I primed and painted the 3D printed sleeve. Only the top 2 inches is visible when the lamp is assembled, so the rough spots here aren’t a problem.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>If I were building this lamp for production … or if I had access to the right tools, I’d want to make the sleeve and platform out of sheet metal to improve heat dissipation.</span></p>
<p><span>On top of the shade, I added a louvered cover. This enables the shade to emit additional light from the top, while obscuring the bulb, which is too bright to look at directly. This also permits heat to escape. I printed these parts out of translucent PETG, which has a higher plasticization temperature than some other common 3D printing filament materials. This isn’t strictly necessary because the surface temperature of the bulb doesn’t really get that hot. Even after hours of continuous use, the temperate is &lt;130 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Making it better</strong></h3>
<p><span>This lamp is mostly a proof of concept, but it works and looks good enough that I plan to keep it and use it. If I make another, I have a few ideas for improvement.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sheet metal. Replace the 3D printed sleeve and vented platform with sheet metal to help dissipate heat.</span></li>
<li><span>Replace the DisplayPort MST hub and adapters. These take up a lot of space and add significant expense (~$250 for the hub and 4 adapters). One theoretical alternative is a DisplayLink adapter based on the </span><a href="https://www.displaylink.com/integrated-chipsets/dl-4000"><span>DL-4100</span></a><span>, which would drive displays over USB and support EDP. I haven’t been able to find such a device on the market yet. Another option to drive displays from USB3 would be to use an SBC with Displayport Alt Mode. I would still need to adapt Displayport to eDP. Adapter boards that do this are bulky and have a lot of components because they provide power and control to the backlight. Since I’m not using a backlight, I could make a simpler adapter that just maps pins for the different connectors.</span></li>
<li><span>Finally, reconsider the closed frame design. Elroy’s shade is basically a closed box. I made this choice&nbsp; to obscure the bulb and hide some electronic components like the EDP ribbon cables and adapters. An open frame design might be possible. One idea is to backlight the panels with edge lighting so I can reduce or eliminate the high wattage bulb.</span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This week, we close out our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, although I ought to note that there will be at least one addendum discussing pre-modern cast iron and crucible steel (Wootz) production.  Last week, we looked at the processes used to create steel from iron by introducing carbon (rather than the modern method of producing steel from pig iron by <em>removing</em> carbon).  That process changes the characteristics of the metal, since steel is harder and more elastic (bending and springing back, rather than bending and staying bent) than iron.</p>



<p>But the chemical composition of the iron or steel isn’t the only factor in determining its hardness and ductility: mechanical processes and heat treatment also alter the internal structure of the metal.  Since the pre-modern blacksmith works with both of these – mechanical processes through hammer and heat through the ‘heats’ of forging – he cannot afford to disregard the changes that both bring.  As we noted in part III, the blacksmith’s job is not merely to bring the metal into the necessary <em>shape</em> for its final application, he also has to get it there with the right <em>characteristics</em> – the correct balance of hardness, strength, ductility and elasticity to get the job done, whatever that job might be.</p>



<p>And I should note again that different tools – and indeed, different parts of the same tool – might have very different demands in this regard.  Metal files needed to be prodigiously hard so that they could abrade already quite hard materials.  The tips of chisels and picks also needed to be very hard, to keep their shape under repeated impacts, but not so hard that they broke; some ductility to absorb the energy of impact was needed.  Armor needed typically to only be somewhat hardened (though demands of this sort get higher with gunpowder) and can be fairly malleable; the armor plate that deforms elastically on impact still absorbs the strike.  Swords made varied demands: their significant length demanded strong steel with good elasticity to be able to spring back into proper shape after absorbing the forces of swings and impacts, while keeping a good cutting edge demanded a high degree of hardness (hardness being the characteristic that determines how sharp an edge can be and also how well that sharpness can be held during use).</p>



<p>So a blacksmith couldn’t simply maximize one trait at the expense of the others. Nor could they have just one kind of steel, with just one set of characteristics for every application.  Rather the learned techniques – copied and practiced during their apprenticeship – were developed, probably over generations, by experimentation to produce tools, weapons and armor each with its own unique ‘right blend’ of characteristics, though two major methods we will discuss today (along with, of course, carbon content, which we discussed last week).</p>

<h2>Work Hardening</h2>



<p><strong>Work hardening</strong> refers to the tendency of metals, when hammered (or strained into any kind of plastic deformation) to become harder.  In its pristine state, the atoms of a metal are generally arranged in a crystal structure, joined by metallic bonds.  These lattices of atoms are neat and regular.  When that neat, regular lattice of atoms is strained, resulting in plastic (rather than elastic) deformation, those neat regular lattices get scrunched and bent and otherwise dislocated.  This happens in iron, but also in most metals – indeed, work hardening is <em>much more</em> important in bronze-work than it is in iron-work, though it cannot be neglected in either.</p>



<p>That dislocation makes the metal resistant to further deformation (plastic <em>or</em> elastic), both increasing the hardness of the metal and its yield strength (the amount of energy you need to apply for plastic, rather than elastic deformation to take place), but at the same time makes the metal less malleable and more brittle (that is, more likely to break than bend).  This is a property that must have been apparent to the earliest copper-smiths: as they hammered their copper into shape, each blow made the metal slightly more resistant to hammering, until eventually it would refuse to budge almost completely (and possibly break instead).  But the same process works for iron, though because of the different production process for iron, it has to be a touch more intentional.</p>



<p>It is possible to reset this process through a process called <strong>annealing</strong>.  When a work hardened metal is heated up, the energy provided by the heat allows the atoms to break and reform their bonds, causing the crystal structure to return to its normal lattice and removing the various dislocations (while retaining its new shape).  To completely anneal iron, it is heated up to its annealing temperature (which varies based on the carbon content, as you can see in the chart below) and held there for an extended period, which will cause it to get a soft as possible for the given iron and carbon content.  This can be very handy if the iron needs to be cold worked (see below).</p>

<p>If the iron is not held at the high temperature, but is allowed to cool slowly in the air, it is said to be <em>normalized</em> (this process, <em><strong>normalization</strong></em>, is a subset of annealing).  As with full annealing, the heating process works out all of the little strains in metal (heats for this process range from 700 to 900°C), but by cooling it slowly afterwards (rather than holding it at a high temperature), it causes the actual size of the atomic lattice of the metal to shrink (the technical term is ‘grain refinement’ as the individual grains of the lattice are ‘refined’ – meaning ‘get smaller’), which results in a metal <em>somewhat</em> harder than in a fully annealed state.  Normalization is an important step for metal that is going to be subsequently heat treated as well.</p>



<p>Now the attentive reader will be thinking, “but wait, if heating the metal up to forging heat and letting it cool in the air resets the work hardening process – well, we’re doing that every time we heat the metal for forging.”  Indeed!  <strong>Hot</strong> <strong>working </strong>(which is what we’ve been describing so far with forging) generally does not meaningfully work harden metal for this very reason.  And for a smith working with good steel that is going to be <em>heat treated</em> (which we’ll discuss in a minute) this doesn’t matter a whole lot.  </p>



<p>But – for reasons which we’ll discuss – iron with very low carbon contents <em>cannot</em> be heat treated for hardness.  <strong>For a smith working with nearly pure (no carbon) iron, work hardening is his best option for increasing hardness and yield strength.</strong>  In this case, the iron object would typically be brought essentially to its final shape and then finished by being hammered <em>cold</em> (‘<strong>cold working</strong>‘).  While copper and bronze are generally soft enough to be almost entirely cold worked, iron really isn’t, except in fairly thin sheets, so the bulk of the actual <em>shaping</em> will still be done with hot forging, but with a final phase of cold hammering which will induce work hardening (and also, incidentally, can remove tool marks from the hot working, which might be cosmetically desirable).</p>



<h2>Heat Treatment Basics</h2>



<p>The changes steel undergoes when it is heated and cools can also alter its characteristics.  Because, as we’ll see, a big part of the effect of heat treatment has to do with the carbon atoms diffused within the crystalline iron structure of steel, pure iron and low carbon steel cannot be effectively heat treated and has to instead be work hardened in order to achieve similar results.  Heat treatment allows the blacksmith fairly fine control over the hardness, strength and ductility of the steel and can even allow for different parts of a single steel object to be hardened to different degrees.</p>



<p>For high-carbon steel, the heat treatment cycle is often called ‘tempering and quenching’ although as we’ll see it would perhaps be more accurate to call the process <em><strong>hardening, quenching and tempering</strong></em> (and then quenching one more time) to get the correct order.  It is something of an irony that first, intense <em>quenching</em> of raw, red-hot steel (the second quenching is much less dramatic as it occurs at much lower temperatures) – almost always shown as the <em>final</em> step in blacksmithing in film or video games – is essentially never the final step, for reasons that will soon become apparent.</p>



<p>First, some complicated metallurgy and then we’ll get to the actual real world processes a blacksmith would use.  High carbon steel is initially a mix of two kinds of iron, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_iron"><strong>ferrite</strong> </a>and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite">cementite</a></strong>, the former being a cubic atomic structure of pure iron, whereas the later is an iron-carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C for the curious).  If that steel is heated above 912°C (but not melted), something interesting starts to happen: the ferrite structure changes into <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenite">austenite</a></strong>.  Avoiding the deep weeds of metallurgy here, all we need to know is that austenite is a <em>different</em> cube of iron that is able to absorb carbon atoms, pulling them out of the cementite and trapping them inside the individual austentite structures.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language select-able on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>There have been three versions of UNIX. The earliest version (circa 1969–70) ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers. The second version ran on the unprotected PDP-11/20 computer. This paper describes only the PDP-11/40 and /45 [l] system since it is more modern and many of the differences between it and older UNIX systems result from redesign of features found to be deficient or lacking.</p>

<p>Since PDP-11 UNIX became operational in February 1971, about 40 installations have been put into service; they are generally smaller than the system described here. Most of them are engaged in applications such as the preparation and formatting of patent applications and other textual material, the collection and processing of trouble data from various switching machines within the Bell System, and recording and checking telephone service orders. Our own installation is used mainly for research in operating systems, languages, computer networks, and other topics in computer science, and also for document preparation.</p>

<p>Perhaps <mark>the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort</mark>: UNIX can run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and less than two man years were spent on the main system software. Yet UNIX contains a number of features seldom offered even in much larger systems. <mark>It is hoped, however, the users of UNIX will find that the most important characteristics of the system are its simplicity, elegance, and ease of use.</mark></p>

<p>Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED[2], linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL[3] with types and structures (C), interpreter for a dialect of BASIC, text formatting program, Fortran compiler, Snobol interpreter, top-down compiler-compiler (TMG) [4], bottom-up compiler-compiler (YACC), form letter generator, macro processor (M6) [5], and permuted index program.</p>

<p>There is also a host of maintenance, utility, recreation, and novelty programs. All of these programs were written locally. It is worth noting that the system is totally self-supporting. All UNIX software is maintained under UNIX; likewise, UNIX documents are generated and formatted by the UNIX editor and text formatting program.</p>

<h2 id="2-hardware-and-software-environment">2. Hardware and Software Environment</h2>

<p>The PDP-11/45 on which our UNIX installation is implemented is a 16-bit word (8-bit byte) computer with 144 Kbytes of core memory; UNIX occupies 42K bytes. This system, however, includes a very large number of device drivers and enjoys a generous allotment of space for I/O buffers and system tables; a minimal system capable of running the software mentioned above can require as little as 50K bytes of core altogether.</p>

<p>The PDP-11 has a 1M byte fixed-head disk, used for filesystem storage and swapping, four moving-head disk drives which each provide 2.5M bytes on removable disk cartridges, and a single moving-head disk drive which uses removable 40M byte disk packs. There are also a high-speed paper tape reader-punch, nine-track magnetic tape,and D-tape (a variety of magnetic tape facility in which individual records may be addressed and rewritten). Besides the console typewriter, there are 14 variable-speed communications interfaces attached to 100-series datasets and a 201 dataset interface used primarily for spooling printout to a communal line printer. There are also several one-of-a-kind devices including a Picturephone® interface,a voice response unit, a voice synthesizer, a phototypesetter, a digital switching network, and a satellite PDP-11/20 which generates vectors, curves, and characters on a Tektronix 611 storage-tube display.</p>

<p>The greater part of UNIX software is written in the above-mentioned C language [6]. Early versions of the operating system were written in assembly language, but during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C. The size of the new system is about one third greater than the old. Since the new system is not only much easier to understand and to modify but also includes many functional improvements, including multiprogramming and the ability to share reentrant code among several user programs, we considered this increase in size quite acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-file-system">3. The File System</h2>

<p>The most important job of UNIX is to provide a file system.
<label for="mn-1">⊕</label>
<span>
 S: Note how the paper considers files important. Unix exposes all the functionality through files.
</span>
From the point of view of the user, there are three kinds of files: ordinary disk files, directories, and special files</p>

<h3 id="31-ordinary-files">3.1 Ordinary Files</h3>

<p><mark>A file contains whatever information the user places on it, for example symbolic or binary (object) programs. No particular structuring is expected by the system.</mark> Files of text consist simply of a string of characters, with lines demarcated by the new-line character. Binary programs are sequences of words as they will appear in core memory when the program starts executing. A few user programs manipulate files with more structure: the assembler generates and the loader expects an object file in a particular format. However, the structure of files is controlled by the programs which use them, not by the system.</p>

<h3 id="32-directories">3.2 Directories</h3>

<p><mark>Directories provide the mapping between the names of files and the files themselves, and thus induce a structure on the file system as a whole.</mark> Each user has a directory of his own files; he may also create subdirectories to contain groups of files conveniently treated together. A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it cannot be written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system controls the contents of directories. However, anyone with appropriate permission may read a directory just like any other file.</p>

<p>The system maintains several directories for its own use. One of these is the <em>root</em> directory. All files in the system can be found by tracing a path through a chain of directories until the desired file is reached. The starting point for such searches is often the root. Another system directory contains all the programs provided for general use; that is, all the <em>commands</em>. As will be seen however, it is by no means necessary that a program reside in this directory for it to be executed.</p>

<p><label for="mn-2">⊕</label>
<span>
 S: This is a succinct description of path system of unix and Linux
</span>
Files are named by sequences of 14 or fewer characters. When the name of a file is specified to the system, it may be in the form of a <em>path name</em>, which is a sequence of directory names separated by slashes <code>/</code> and ending in a file name. If the sequence begins with a slash, the search begins in the root directory. The name <code>/alpha/beta/gamma</code> causes the system to search the root for directory <code>alpha</code>, then to search <code>alpha</code> for <code>beta</code>, finally to find <code>gamma</code> in <code>beta</code>. <code>gamma</code> may be an ordinary file, a directory, or a special file. As a limiting case, the name <code>/</code> refers to the root itself.</p>

<p>A path name not starting with <code>/</code> causes the system to begin the search in the user’s current directory. Thus, the name <code>alpha/beta</code> specifies the file named <code>beta</code> in subdirectory <code>alpha</code> of the current directory. The simplest kind of name, for example <code>alpha</code>, refers to a file which itself is found in the current directory. As another limiting case, the null file name refers to the current directory.</p>

<p>The same nondirectory file may appear in several directories under possibly different names. This feature is called <em>linking</em>; a directory entry for a file is sometimes called a link. <mark>UNIX differs from other systems in which linking is permitted in that all links to a file have equal status.</mark> That is, a file does not exist within a particular directory; the directory entry for a file consists merely of its name and a pointer to the information actually describing the file. Thus a file exists independently of any directory entry, although in practice a file is made to disappear along with the last link to it.</p>

<p>Each directory always has at least two entries. The name in each directory refers to the directory itself. Thus a program may read the current directory under the name <code>.</code> without knowing its complete path name. The name <code>..</code> by convention refers to the parent of the directory in which it appears, that is, to the directory in which it was created.</p>

<p><mark>The directory structure is constrained to have the form of a rooted tree.</mark> Except for the special entries <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>, each directory must appear as an entry in exactly one other,which is its parent. Te reason for this is to simplify the writing of programs which visit subtrees of the directory structure, and more important, to avoid the separation of portions of the hierarchy. If arbitrary links to directories were permitted, it would be quite difficult to detect when the last connection from the root to a directory was severed.</p>

<blockquote><p>God’s promise was never that life would be fair. God’s promise was that when we had to confront the unfairness of life, we would not have to do so alone because He would be with us.</p><cite>– The twenty-third psalm</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.</p><cite>– The Talmud</cite></blockquote>



<p>Today is October 15th, 2020. One year ago today I received a stem cell transplant. Soon after I sat down to write a letter to the stranger who had donated her stem cells and saved my life. </p>



<p>I knew nothing about her other than she lived in Germany and was thirty-seven (one year older than me) and she had beautiful cursive handwriting, much better than mine. The letter she had sent me (the one I was responding to)  was written on colorful stationary and in perfect English, although if she had someone translate the words for her, I don’t know. </p>



<p>She called me friend and said she was sending love and best wishes for my recovery. She sent me lip balm and hand cream and cinnamon candies and a hat she had knitted herself.</p>



<p>I had no stationary, so I ripped out a few pages from my notebook and clipped the edges with scissors to make them as clean as possible. I had terrible handwriting, even worse than usual; I was taking so many medications I could barely keep track of them, and I didn’t know which one was causing the tremor in my hands, the slight vibration that made it almost impossible to write.</p>



<p>I sat in stasis, pen in hand, hovered over the page. What was holding me back wasn’t my tremulous hands, or my penmanship, or my lack of stationary. It was that I didn’t know how to thank a stranger who had just saved my life. </p>



<p>Here I was, thirty-six but withered away because of what had happened to me, skin brown and mottled from the radiation, eyes sunken and hollow. How could anything I ever did going forward be as significant as the act that saved me? What could I say when I simultaneously felt I had been saved, but also felt like everything had been taken away?</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure what to write her, so I wrote her the truth.</p>



<p>God’s promise was never that life would be fair. When I found out my cancer had relapsed, I hoped I would die quickly. It’s because I had learned there is something worse than death, and it is fear. </p>



<p>That night, my oncologist, Dr. Eradat, came to see me in the hospital.  He sat next to me on the hospital bed and and told me the prognosis wasn’t as good this time. He wouldn’t give me a number (he never wanted to take away hope), so I did the research myself. The most recent paper on the subject showed a 5-year survival rate for someone like me as 18%.</p>



<p>Dr. Eradat told me a stem cell transplant was my only hope. Without it I would die. I needed a genetically matched donor. Did I have any siblings?</p>



<p>As I listened to him I felt the blood drain out of my face, and I tried to control the trembling of my hands but I couldn’t.</p>



<p>“I have a brother,” I said. “But he’s not biologically related to me. I’m adopted.”</p>



<p>He frowned. “We’ll have to find a match on the bone marrow registry, then.” </p>



<p>I think family is the order in which you call people when you find out you’re going to die. First I called my parents. My mom picked up the phone, and when I told her she said “Oh…fuck,” and then I don’t remember what was said after. </p>



<p>She was with me the first time it happened—through the diagnosis and three years of chemotherapy, and she stayed home from work to take care of me, and she blended my food into a little paste when the sores in my mouth made it too painful to eat, and she wrapped herself around me when I flung myself into her arms crying that I was sure the pain would kill me—so I’m not sure much more needed to be said.</p>



<p>Next I called my brother, Zach. Whatever shock he felt on the phone he concealed well, but his wife told me later that after we hung up he frantically Google searched “relapsed T cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma stem cell transplant prognosis” and then locked himself in the bathroom for the rest of the afternoon and sobbed. </p>



<p>I told him he couldn’t be a donor match for me because we weren’t biologically related, but he signed up to be a donor on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-bone-marrow/join-the-marrow-registry/" target="_blank">Be The Match website</a> and mailed in his DNA kit anyway.</p>



<p>God’s promise was never that life would be fair. There are over twenty million people on the registry, but because so many genes need to be matched, many people cannot find a single matched donor. The match rate is the lowest—perhaps under 50%—for people who are of mixed ethnicity (I am half Caucasian and half North African).</p>



<p>I always thought my ethnic background was so interesting. Now I wished I were just plain-ol’ lily white.</p>



<p>When I got out of the hospital I continued to work and see patients (because what else was I going to do?). When my hair started falling out from the chemotherapy I bought hats and scarfs to cover my head, and when I shat my pants in front of a patient because I no longer had any control over my body I ran into the bathroom and hid until someone came in I could ask for help. I lost my favorite pair of pants that day.</p>



<p>In between patients I would check my phone and email obsessively, waiting to hear if the doctors had found a match for me.</p>



<p>At night there was no escape from the fear. I would lie in bed—hearing only the hollow echo of emptiness vibrating back to me, observing myself as if I were hovering outside of my body—and think about what it would feel like to die. </p>



<p>Most likely the tumor in my chest would continue to rapidly grow unchecked, and it would become so large it would surround and squeeze my lungs and heart, and I would either go into heart failure or suffocate to death.</p>



<p>To expect anything else felt futile; to have hope felt too sad and too crushing.</p>



<p>One day I was at my office, sitting at my desk and clicking through work emails. I had sent a mass announcement to my patients letting them knowing I was closing my practice, and making sure they had referrals. I received many beautiful emails in response from my patients telling me how sorry they were and how they wished me well. There is one message I will never forget.</p>



<p>It was from a shy, reserved young man with treatment-resistant depression. Something about his age (too young to be suffering so much) and his demeanor (charmingly awkward) endeared him to me, and  I so desired to take his pain away. Nothing I did, though, seemed to work. I had felt like a failure for letting him down.</p>



<p>His message to me told a different story. It might have contained more words than he had spoken cumulatively since we first started working together six months earlier. He wrote:</p>



<p><em>“I’ll be forever grateful for what your guidance has done for me. Until you started treating me, I never trusted the therapists I had seen and I didn’t believe what I had was really something that could be helped. I thought I’d just have to deal with it. </em></p>



<p><em>I want you to know that there are very few people that have made as positive an impact on my life as you, and your help truly changed my life. It may have even saved it.”</em></p>



<p>Something shifted in me when I read it. Had I really saved his life? Could it be true my life was worth this much to others, that sometimes we help the world in ways we don’t realize? Could I hope for my life not just for myself, but for those I might one day help?</p>



<p>I started to cry, and then I started to beg. It felt futile to hope, but I did it anyway. <em>Please God, I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die.</em> </p>



<p>At least one life had been saved, even if it wasn’t mine.</p>



<p>It was shortly after that we found her—the one in twenty million who shared enough of my genes that she could save my life. All they would tell me was she lived in Germany and was thirty-seven years old. I asked, Was this confirmed? Did she promise? Could we wrap her in bubble wrap until it happened (you know, just to be safe)?</p>



<p>My transplant was scheduled. I was admitted to the hospital and received my conditioning treatment (chemotherapy and radiation). She donated her cells in Germany, and they were couriered overnight to Los Angeles. I couldn’t let myself believe it was really happening until it did—until I saw the pale pink bag of cells hanging off of my IV pole, infusing into my arm.</p>

<p>It worked. The next month was hard, but her cells successfully engrafted into my bone marrow. Over this past year I’ve been slowly recovering. My DNA is gone; my blood cells are no longer mine, but hers.</p>



<p>Now it was not just one life that had been saved, but two.</p>



<p>Then… something <em>really</em> amazing happened.</p>



<p>Two months ago, my brother received a call. </p>



<p>It was from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bethematch.org/support-the-cause/donate-bone-marrow/join-the-marrow-registry/" target="_blank">Be the Match</a>, and they were calling about that DNA kit he had mailed in the year before, the one he did in symbolic solidarity with me. He was a perfect DNA match for someone who needed a stem cell transplant, a sixty-seven year old man—the one in twenty million who shared enough of his genes he could save his life. A stem cell transplant was the only cure for this man’s disease. He had no family who could donate. Without it he would die.</p>



<p>My brother submitted a second kit for confirmation, and then did the pre-donation physicals and labs. The week before, he received injections of Neupogen, a medication that stimulates your bone marrow to make extra stem cells. Then he drove from his home in Fort Lauderdale to Miami where he was hooked up to a machine that filtered the extra stem cells out of his blood. It took eight hours.</p>



<p>When he was done the cells were whisked away and couriered overnight to wherever they had to go the save the person who needed them. </p>



<p>Maybe this man, too, had asked if my brother could be wrapped in bubble wrap, asked if he had promised, prayed he would follow through. Maybe he couldn’t let himself believe it was really happening until it did—until he saw the pale pink bag of cells hanging off of his IV pole, infusing into his arm.</p>



<p>It was not two lives that had been saved, but three.</p>
