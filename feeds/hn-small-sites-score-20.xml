  				 <p>December 2020</p>

<p>If your product moves money on behalf of customers, and you manage the ledger, you need reconciliation. You can think of recon as the process of making sure every transaction in your system matches one in the external world. For every dollar you’ve moved, an external entity agrees with the amount and direction, and has provided “documentation” to that effect.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few performant recon systems that came under stress as they scaled, and I’ve worked with startups at early enough stages that getting recon right was not existential. I’ve also never built a recon system from scratch. Everything I'll say here is from the perspective of a user of recon systems rather than a maker of them. I’ve been a customer of a couple, and their performance impacted my output so I have strong opinions about what I wish would exist. Since I'm not sure what a perfect recon system would look like, I'm writing this to flesh out the thought, and to smoke out anyone who already knows.</p>
<p>I’ve interacted with reconciliation systems aimed at two types of problems:</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of transactions</h2>
<p>Transaction oriented recon makes sure that some external party agrees with every money movement in your ledger. I saw this philosophy in the recon systems I interacted with at Cash App &amp; Square in general. In this model, the objective is to make sure that every money movement action matches your intention. This means the state of the transaction, the direction, and the amount are what you expect. A secondary objective is ensuring the timing matches your intention. This is secondary because in a lot of cases, the actual precise timing doesn't matter as long as it happens&nbsp; "soon", and as long as the underlying accounts aren’t run at a $0 balance. In this case reconciliation solves an accounting problem, ensuring money movements are correct. It also helps ensure that the company's receivables and payables are complete, is useful for regulatory &amp; financial audits, and empowers your treasury team to make good cash management decisions. I suspect most acquirers (Stripe, Square, Adyen, etc.) at least start by pursuing transaction oriented recon.</p>
<p>Typically in an acquiring world, you construct the “internal” ledger from the settlement/capture messages generated by the card networks. This is what product teams look at to inform customer facing features. You construct the “external” ledger from settlement files generated by the acquiring bank. Accounting teams look at the external ledger (technically accounting teams look at both ledgers, but product teams rarely look at the external ledger on an ongoing basis).</p>
<p>A recon system often includes an engineering team paired with an operations team, working together. In cases where the internal and external ledgers disagree, a human (on the ops team) reviews the data. They determine what’s causing the exception, whether it's systematic, how frequently it occurs, and what to do to fix it. The eng team continually optimizes the process to reduce the exception rate over time. Transaction oriented recon primarily solves accounting problems. You’re typically working towards SLAs designed for monthly/quarterly earnings close, and your outputs feed into income/cash flow statements.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of balances</h2>
<p>Balance oriented recon ensures precise amounts in bank or customer accounts on a periodic basis. You use the same internal and external ledgers as in transaction oriented recon. However, you're comparing not only the amounts, state and direction of a transaction, but also its timing. This type of recon system can be useful for accounting, but is ideal for building systems that report a balance at a point in time. One example is a banking system of record. In the case of a system of record, a balance oriented recon system informs customer-facing balances and FDIC insurance.</p>
<p>Balance oriented recon systems are required for organizations that issue instruments and are the final source of truth for their own ledger. Most financial technology companies today rely on the ledgers managed by their infrastructure providers. For instance, if you issue cards, the banking as a service platform typically connects to the bank’s core, and most traditional bank cores have a balance oriented recon framework built in.</p>
<p>For context - in order to provide FDIC insurance to customers, banks are required to provide an auditable record of customer balances at any point in time. This is usually solved by being able to provide a daily snapshot of customer balances. This function is one of several provided by core processors, and as a result most core processors have a balance oriented recon process built in by default.</p>
<p>However if you’re the rare card issuer managing your own ledger (or really building any kind of financial product where you’re responsible for your own ledger, such as a digital wallet where you own the money transmission licenses), you’ll need to build a balance oriented recon system eventually. It's the way you’ll be sure you have the money that you’re telling customers you have.</p>
<h2>Common Problems in Recon</h2>
<h3>Adding a new money movement type to a single balance</h3>
<p>One overarching problem that affects all recon systems is what happens when new types of money movement impact a balance. For instance, imagine you run a digital wallet where your primary funding and cash-out transaction types are ACH debits and credits. Also, imagine you’ve built a perfect reconciliation system, with the combination of technology and human process that allows you to tie out balances and payments with zero failures (this is super unlikely). The moment you add payment cards as funding/cash out instruments, you now have a different external ledger to integrate with. It will have different edges than you're used to. You'll deal with potentially different organizations, who have different processes for resolving exceptions. No matter what you do, this will take time to get right, and long after your new feature is launched, you’ll probably discover new, undocumented quirks. Some of these quirks will only be clear when you’re processing money movements at scale. I’ve seen cases where the incorrect MID set with a card network resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars routed to the wrong (internal) account. Survivable error as the transactions were reconciled in aggregate, but bad for accounting and distraction caused to cross functional team members pulled in to swarm the problem.</p>
<h3>Timing differences between authorization and settlement</h3>
<p>For balance oriented reconciliation systems in particular, solving timing problems is critical. Timing problems typically occur when a) the payment authorization time and the settlement time are different, and your system’s not necessarily aware, b) you’re dealing with payment types where the settlement amount can be adjusted multiple times c) your ledger updates customers balances when a new payment authorization comes in, rather than a settlement message. In all these cases you’re grappling with a few questions (I don’t actually know the right answers to these):</p>
<ul>
<li>When should you update a customer’s balance? When you know there is a transaction (when the auth comes in) or when amount is finalized (when the settlement comes in)</li>
<li>When the authorization and settlement amounts are different, do you retroactively adjust the balance for the day the authorization came in? Or do you fix that in place and only adjust the balance with the delta on the day the settlement arrives?</li>
<li>Is your snapshot on a particular day immutable (i.e. it can never be adjusted) and if so, how do you handle changes in amounts between the authorization and the settlement?</li>
<li>Traditional core systems will have an available balance (which is how much you can access, with pending transaction amounts removed), and an account balance (which includes pending transactions, and is typically higher than the available balance).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relying on aged systems for exception handling</h3>
<p>Very often you work with a wholesale bank whose systems are seasoned and handle the majority of exceptions using manual workflows. This can be frustrating; you’re faced with either adopting their manual processes, which bind your cost structure to theirs, or accepting a higher exception rate temporarily while you build technical systems around their process. There’s no easy trade-off here.</p>
<h3>Early prototyping and float problems</h3>
<p>In the course of product development you’ll often prototype by adding new money movement types to your ledger. A lot of these prototypes (as should happen) will be discarded. Despite this, they will have moved real money and affected your real ledger, and (at least for your accounting team's sanity) you’ll need a stateful way to reconcile the money that moved to your ledger. While at Cash I once spent a year integrating into 6 card issuer processor systems while prototyping the Cash Card. With each integration we needed a float (depositing funds with the card issuer so we could test transactions in the real world) which meant our accounting team now had 6 new banking relationships to monitor, 4 of which lasted less than 6 months, but all of which required material floats amounts. In a few cases, the issuer processor didn’t actually enable us to manage our own ledger, so we’d have a parallel ledger (one on our databases and a mirror on theirs) that we’d have to keep in sync. There was at least one integration that we ultimately discarded, which took us several months to reconcile, long after we’d walked away from the partnership. How you handle these cases will depend on what’s financially “material” for your organization. In our cases, prototype floats were all sub $100k, so survivable at our scale. But tracking these down repeatedly was an insane level of tedium.</p>
<h3>Managing ledgers across many internal bank accounts</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll contract with multiple banks for different financial services. For instance one bank for merchant acquiring and another for …</p></div></div>

        <div>
          <p>It is a really great time to be a developer.</p>

<p>We have tons of APIs integrated within great tools for building dynamic, full stack apps. If you are a developer, you probably are using technologies like schemaless data stores, serverless architectures, JSON APIs, and/or the GraphQL language.</p>

<p>Further, there are a bunch of cool frameworks like the <strong>Jam</strong>stack (<strong>J</strong>avaScript, <strong>A</strong>PIs, and <strong>M</strong>arkup) and services like Netlify to make it fast to deploy a serverless app.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time ever, Apache Cassandra is a part of this stack because <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/">Stargate is now live on Astra</a> as the official data API.</p>

<p>The modern apps we build need data APIs which integrate into our toolset and work with native data shapes (JSON, REST, GraphQL, etc). These data APIs need to support schemaless JSON, while simultaneously providing speed and scalability.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it better only take a few minutes for us to use them within our project.</p>

<p>DataStax built <a href="https://stargate.io/">Stargate</a> into Astra to give us, app developers, a natural data API stack which meshes with the Jamstack (or serverless stack of your choice). Stargate in Astra is built on the rock solid NoSQL data engine (Apache Cassandra) which powers Netflix, Instagram, Yelp, iCloud and other apps we all use everyday.</p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-stargate">What exactly is Stargate?</h2>
<p>Stargate is an <a href="https://stargate.io/2020/09/14/init-stargate.html">open source data gateway</a> that sits between your app server and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project.</p>

<p>Multiple successful app companies - like Netflix and Yelp - built their own data gateways to help internal app developers create features using simple APIs, without needing to learn the underlying database or mess with schema.</p>

<p>DataStax integrated Stargate into Astra to give you the same power and ease of access to your data.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No upfront data modelling needed for Documents.</li>
  <li>Less custom code to maintain.</li>
  <li>More time to build what you care about.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png"></p>

<p>You can work with your data the way you want – JSON via schemaless document APIs or database schema aware GraphQL and RESTful APIs – while Stargate serves as the proxy that coordinates these requests to different flavors of Cassandra.</p>

<p>To see it in action, let’s see how this works by using JSON with Stargate’s schemaless Document API in a TikTok clone. Because, if Instagram and Snapchat have a TikTok clone, we should have one, too. Right?</p>

<h2 id="real-quick-note-first">Real Quick Note First</h2>

<p>Slinging JSON to and from Apache Cassandra without data modeling is just too much fun. You gotta <a href="http://astra.datastax.com/">try this out in Astra for yourself</a>. You can get <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">hands on with it right away</a> or check out our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a> to see schemaless Cassandra in action.</p>

<p>We are stoked to have engineers from Netflix, Burberry, Macquarie Bank, USAA, and Yelp creating Stargate with us. They are already hard at work battletesting the APIs and collaborating on new features.</p>

<p>Ok, onto the code!</p>

<h2 id="posts-in-tiktok">Posts in TikTok</h2>

<p>We are going to walk through using Stargate’s APIs in Astra for creating and updating posts within a TikTok clone. We’re walking through examples that are ready to be pasted into your latest Jamstack app.</p>

<p>To use Stargate in Astra in your app, first install and set up our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections">JavaScript SDK</a>. You can learn about storing environment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSmzEGZQI5A">variables in your .env file here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a basic TikTok post: a video with a caption, like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>postId</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/FTBP02Y.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>caption</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>timestamp</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>2020-12-09T09:08:31.020Z</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>likes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After connecting to Stargate in Astra with a nodejs client, let’s create a new collection in our app and add the post with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postsCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span>
  <span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>posts</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>postData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve ever used Cassandra before, you know this is amazing. Look at what we didn’t do: no data modeling, no table creation, no configuration code, no partition keys, no clustering columns. I think you get my drift.</p>

<p>Stargate in Astra allows you to add data to Apache Cassandra in one line of code.</p>

<p>This level of ease of use hasn’t previously been possible with Cassandra. Insert JSON and move on.</p>

<p>Next up, let’s say you want to find all posts about ducks. You can do that via:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find all posts about ducks</span>
<span>const</span> <span>posts</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>caption</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>{</span> <span>$in</span><span>:</span>  <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>ducks</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And boom. Now you have your ducks channel all set up for your users. Because who doesn’t want a stream fully dedicated to ducks?</p>

<p>Now, your app isn’t going to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-fleets-reactions-memes-edit-button-1548037">be like Twitter</a>. We can edit stuff here. Let’s show how to edit your post’s caption. Stories tho? That’s on you</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// update the post’s caption</span>
<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>caption</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are MEGA cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above was just a quick tour on how to do a few data API calls for a basic TikTok clone. Want to see the full thing? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATOicvih5A">Ania Kubow</a>’s tutorial to see how to wire this up into a full React app with Netlify.</p>

<p>If you came down here, maybe you are looking for a few more lines of code.</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>Let’s show how to set up the node JS client and a few more data API calls. For starters, let’s take a look at how to set up your client to connect to Stargate in Astra.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// npm install @astrajs/collections</span>

<span>{</span>   <span>astraDatabaseId</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_ID</span><span>,</span>

<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Easy enough.</p>

<p>Then, let’s create a users collection in our database to store documents about our TikTok users:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create the users collection in the app</span>
<span>const</span> <span>usersCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>users</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A TikTok user in our app will have the basics: a unique id, a name, username, etc.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>userData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>id_3</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Mo Farooq</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>username</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>avatar</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/9KYq7VG.png</span><span>"</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, let’s add our user into our collection:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a new user</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>userData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check to make sure your user was stored in the database by reading the user back by any of their properties, like their username.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find our user by username</span>
<span>const</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>$eq</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or, you can lookup a user by their <strong>documentId</strong>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// get the user by document id</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And, lastly, if you need to delete that user:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// delete the post</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

                <div>
                    <p>There's a ton of resources scattered around the web dealing with code review fundamentals, best practices, tools, etc. In this article we'll summarize the lessons from a dozen of official company engineering blogs. You can find links to the original articles in <a href="http://localhost:8080/blog/code-reviews"></a><a href="https://blogboard.io/search?searchQuery=code%20review">this blogboard search</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-this-article">What's in this article?</h2><p>We'll cover several topics:</p><ol><li>Why do code reviews?<br>Besides the obvious, quality assurance, there are other benefits to code reviews</li><li>Code reviews as quality assurance<br>We'll cover the general recommendations on what to look for in a code review, why having a review checklist is beneficial, and you'll get a fairly long checklist that you can use as a base for your own list</li><li>Code reviews as a team improvement tool<br>If you've done more than a few code reviews, you know they're useful for more than just preventing bugs. We'll summarize common views on how reviews are beneficial as a learning and team bonding tool</li><li>Preparing a pull request for review<br>Lessons for pull request authors. There are rules of thumb consistently pointed out that help to prepare a PR for a smooth review</li><li>Reviewing code - Be human!<br>Lessons for reviewers on how wording and tone of your comments can make a huge difference in effectiveness of the whole review effort.</li></ol><p>The topics are covered fairly independently, so if you're curious about a particular topic feel free to skip ahead.</p><h2 id="why-do-code-reviews">Why do code reviews?</h2><p>It should be obvious that the primary purpose of code review is to assess quality of the changes being introduced. I mean, the dictionary definition of <em>review </em>says precisely that</p><blockquote><strong>review</strong> <em>(noun) - </em>a formal assessment of something with the intention of instituting change if necessary.</blockquote><p>Of course, code being code, there's a lot of things that can be checked and tested automatically, so there's nuance to what actually needs to be checked in an actual code review. We cover that in the next section.</p><p>On the other hand, code review is a form of communication between the <em><strong>author</strong> </em>of the change (these days usually <em>a pull request</em>) and one or several <em><strong>reviewers</strong>. </em>So it has side effects that go beyond preventing bugs from slipping in or keeping the codebase consistent in terms of style and architecture. </p><p>When done well, code reviews help accelerate learning across the team, create psychological safety for all team members, help establish and communicate best practices, teach proper communication and improve team dynamics. When done poorly, they can help deteriorate all of the above.</p><h2 id="code-reviews-as-quality-assurance">Code reviews as quality assurance </h2><p>There are a bunch of ways in which code reviews help maintain the quality bar for the codebase and the product. In the end it comes down to catching mistakes at the level which can hardly be automatically tested, such as architectural inconsistencies. Also, the code for automated tests should be reviewed, so there's a meta level at which reviews help with QA. </p><p>In <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">Giving High Leverage Code Reviews</a>, Casey Rollins advocates for having a checklist with all the usual things that need attention. </p><blockquote>When I’m reviewing a pull request, I often do multiple “passes” where I focus on one attribute at a time. I start at the beginning and review the pull request with a single attribute in mind before moving on to the next. When I’ve worked through the checklist, I submit the review.<p>This checklist moves from general to specific checks because it’s important to focus on the high-level attributes first. It doesn’t make sense to offer a variable name suggestion if you’re also suggesting that an entire class or function be refactored.</p></blockquote><p>You can have your own checklist or make it a shared list for the team or a project. There's a ton of material written on the usefulness of checklists. In <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>, </em>David Allen puts forward a simple idea -<em> </em>our minds are great at processing information, but terrible at storing and recalling it. That's why checklists are a great way of externally storing and breaking down a planned or repetitive task.</p><p>Compiled from several articles (<a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">1</a>, <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">3</a>) here's a high-level list of things to be concerned about when reviewing a code change:</p><ul><li>Story alignment - does the change meet the requirements of the task at all; ie. does the code implement any and all of the specified functionalities?</li><li>Consistency across the codebase</li><li>Architectural considerations - how does the new piece of code fit the existing architecture. Can the new feature architecture be improved, is it too generic or not extensible enough?</li><li>Simplicity/over-engineering</li><li>Performance concerns - are there specific cases (eg. peak load times) when the code will break? Do the queries pull more data than necessary? Could new queries benefit from adding new indexes to the database?</li><li>Accidental errors such as typos or errors in math formulas - these can be either obvious or really tricky to notice, especially with math heavy code</li><li>Compliance with laws and regulations - depending on the business this might be the most important thing</li><li>Security concerns - are there any exploitable pieces of code being introduced? Are any secrets being shared or stored unsafely?</li><li>Readability and style - a seemingly perfect piece of code might not be immediately understandable and readable to a different pair of eyes. Is it possible to understand the changes without the author explaining them?</li><li>Best practices - programming languages usually have their best practices - are they met in the pull request? Also, with time any project, team and company will evolve their own set of best practices - code reviews are a way to enforce and spread knowledge about them</li><li>Localization - are all language dependent resources localized properly?</li><li>Dependencies - are there external libraries or APIs being introduced? Are there other simpler/faster/better ways to do this with different dependencies or without any?</li><li>Interactions and side effects - how does the new piece of code interact with the rest of the codebase; does the new function implementation break any existing functionality; are all relevant unit tests updated/added</li><li>Logging - it's practically impossible to debug server code properly without good logging. Is everything logged/traced correctly</li><li>Error handling - how are the errors handled on the backend; how are they communicated to the user; are fallbacks activated where possible?</li><li>Testability/Test coverage - is the new piece of code covered with automated tests? Have all the suspicious test cases been checked either automatically or manually? Is the code written in a way that's suitable for unit testing?</li><li>External documentation - in case it's necessary is the external documentation updated to reflect the change?</li></ul><p>It's a pretty long list. In addition to it, a recurring piece of advice is not to use code reviews in place of static code analysis tools. If your review is mostly about code formatting, variable naming and alphabetical ordering, it might be a good time to include an automated code analysis tool into your development workflow.</p><p>In <em><a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">Effective Code Reviews: Bettering Products, Teams, and Engineers</a> </em>from PayPal engineering<em>, </em>Gabriel McAdams points out several important benefits of code reviews related to team dynamics:</p><ul><li>Team cohesion - by making everyone's code subject to peer review, code review process promotes <em>individual accountability, healthy conflict</em> and the idea that everyone's<em> working together</em> to make the product better. As said in <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a>: <em>Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not imply that your code does not need review.</em><br>In summary, McAdams puts it nicely: <em>Trust + healthy conflict + individual accountability + working together to better the team = team cohesion.</em></li><li>Free career improvement training - simply by virtue of reviewing other people's code you become more skilled at reading and understanding new code. I've heard it said that one of the foremost traits of great engineers is the ability to dive into and dissect a completely unfamiliar piece of code. Over time you learn how to spot common practices, little tricks, pieces of syntactic sugar, architectural abstractions and how to appreciate different mental models used to solve the same problem.</li></ul><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a> from the Palantir Blog, Robert Fink lists several ways in which knowledge sharing and social side-effects happen via code reviews:</p><ul><li>Authors are motivated by the peer review process to do all the necessary pre-checks, tighten the loose ends and generally tidy up the code before sending to review</li><li>A code review explicitly communicates changes made to product functionality to team members</li><li>The author maybe used a technique, abstraction or an algorithm that reviewers are unfamiliar with. The opposite can also be the case - reviewers might be aware of a more appropriate way to solve a given problem</li><li>Positive communication strengthens social bonds within the team (might especially be true for remote teams)</li></ul><h2 id="preparing-a-pull-request-for-review-help-the-reviewer">Preparing a pull request for review - help the reviewer</h2><p>Code reviews should be seen as a team effort. Once you view them that way it becomes clear that both sides - the author and the reviewers - have their distinct sets of responsibilities.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.engineering/the-code-review-mindset-3280a4af0a89">this short post</a> on Medium Engineering blog, Xiao Ma describes how a different perspective changes the way code reviews are done, how feedback is taken and how people on each side benefit by adopting a <em>positive mindset</em> about code reviews.</p><p>When we talk about the responsibilities of the pull request author, there are several key things recurring in all code review guides.</p><ol><li><strong>Make pull requests as atomic as possible</strong><br><a href="https://shopify.engineering/great-code-reviews">At Shopify</a> they advise to keep <em>your pull requests small </em>- it helps the reviewer dive into it and finish it as an atomic piece of work in their workday. In practice this can mean keeping your pull requests limited to <em>a single concern. </em>A single concern here means a single bug fix, a feature, an API change etc. Don't mix refactoring that doesn't alter behavior with bug fixes or new features. This is …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>I wrote this post as a result of my frustration with popular business books and with non-fiction books in general. I am not saying every book is like this, some books are insightful and bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. But I have noticed that some authors have an idea and without fleshing it out and properly researching it they decide to write a book about it. Throw in cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias and an incompetent publishers and you have got yourself a popular non-fiction book. There is no peer review and if you sensationalize things you can earn a lot of money. </p>
<p>You cannot even trust books by experts in the field. I bought into the hype of the book Why We Sleep  by Matthew Walker the author seemed legit and well respected within his field. He even appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience. After reading the book I  began espousing the benefits of 8 hour sleep until I read <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">this</a> wonderful article by Alexey Guzey. So who should you trust? Should you stop reading non-fiction altogether? I suggest doing the opposite, read as much as you can and be wary of any broad sweeping statements. Even though some books might get something wrong, the good ideas are still valuable. And as with business you can only get better at it (i.e. filtering signal) by exposing yourself to more of it.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>The traditional CentOS Linux distribution as we know it is dead. Here is another drop in the ocean of opinion pieces that follow the news of its death. After cooling down from the initial rush of blood to my head, here is my take on this event.</p>

<h2>Why Did This Probably Happen</h2>
<p>With the advent of DevOps and SRE, businesses and startups are moving away from the old-school concept of traditional server clusters to running their applications on disposable containers. The trend is clear and true. Developers are increasingly less reliant on a tried-and-true Linux distribution that lasts for a decade. With containers, developers can develop, test, deploy, and rollback with blazing fast velocity.

</p><h2>How It Will Affect All of Us</h2>
<p>Without a doubt one of the most popular Linux distributions to ever exist, CentOS was prevalent among all kinds of computing systems ranging from simple database servers to billion-dollar computer clusters. There are countless organizations have made the business decision to keep using the traditional model, or organizations that do not require microservices at all. With CentOS drawn from below their feet, a lot of organizations will be forced to migrate to another option, or fork out a pretty penny for RHEL. Besides, on-prem deployment of any container orchestration tool still requires a stable Linux distribution.</p>

<p>The second ripple effect it will have is towards the skilled professionals who have spend decades on CentOS. Not every company is willing to pay up for RHEL or risk using CentOS Stream. For those who migrate to Debian or OpenSUSE, they will have to retrain and adapt with different tools.</p>

<h2>Questioning IBM/Red Hat Decisions</h2>
<p>The most obvious of them all was, was it necessary for CentOS to die? With CentOS Stream to track ahead of RHEL, it is still possible for CentOS to remain functional and serve its purpose. This is clearly a business decision to increase profits. It used to be that developers wanted to write for RHEL but did not want pay for it; CentOS filled that need. What also happened was that some companies decided that they wanted the free experience all the way. Red Hat now provides free use of the Red Hat Universal Base Image for developers. With this, companies no longer have an excuse.</p>

<p>Secondly, why the PR disaster? In hindsight, there is no way to deliver this news gently to the public. However, I felt that Red Hat gave the bird to the open source community, especially those who contributed to CentOS, by pulling the plug on Centos 8 towards the end of 2021. There wasn't even a courtesy to end it later then CentOS 7's EOL date, June 30th 2024. A raw-dogged "Pay up, now" to everyone. </p>

<p>Last of all, what is the next move from Red Hat/IBM? With CentOS gone, there is a huge vacuum for another to take its place. RHEL sources are still available and can still be repackaged. While Red Hat currently has massive influence over Linux in general, is this a arrogant statement proclaiming "Hey, you can't live without me"? Another ominuous take with conspiratorial undertones would be that Red Hat plans to eventually scrap the FOSS model, but I would have to wear my tin hat for this one.

</p><h2>So, What Happens Now?</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after the release, all the attention is now directed to towards filling the space that CentOS will leave behind. Undoubtedly, Ubuntu and SUSE would try to assert their presence with their open source alternatives. Debian, the largest behemoth of them all, hopefully will receive funding and participation like never before. A silver lining of this event would perhaps be the buzzing excitement of what will be and can be. It is time to be excited about Linux again. I, for one, have to begin migrating my CentOS containers and virtual machines to Debian.</p>

<p>CentOS's founder, Gregory Kurtzer, is working with the community to establish Rocky Linux. Join them at https://webchat.freenode.net/#rockylinux .</p>

        <div><p>Over the past weeks and months, we’ve seen people coming to YouTube to learn more about where and how to vote or learning more about a candidate or an issue. We’ve seen news organizations grow their audience. And we’ve seen people turn to YouTube for the latest election results or simply to follow an historic event with the highest voting turnout in over a century in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our main goal going into the election season was to make sure we’re connecting people with authoritative information, while also limiting the reach of misinformation and removing harmful content. The work here is ongoing and we wanted to provide an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div><h2>Removing content that violates our policies</h2><p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a> prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence. Since September, we've terminated over 8000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies. Over 77% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views.&nbsp;</p><p>We also work to make sure that the line between what is removed and what is allowed is drawn in the right place. Our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote. We also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical U.S. Presidential election. However in some cases, that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come. As always, news coverage and commentary on these issues can remain on our site if there’s sufficient <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/">education, documentary, scientific or artistic</a> context.</p></div>

And the most viewed channels and videos are from news channels like NBC and CBS.</p></div>

Collectively, these information panels have been shown over 4.5 billion times. Starting today, we will update this information panel, linking to the “2020 Electoral College Results” page from the Office of the Federal Register, noting that as of December 8, states have certified Presidential election results, with Joe Biden as the President-elect. It will also continue to include a link to CISA, explaining that states certify results after ensuring ballots are properly counted and correcting irregularities and errors.</p></div>

        <div><p>Now let’s look at recommendations, one of the main ways our viewers find content. Limiting the reach of borderline content and prominently surfacing authoritative information are important ways we protect people from problematic content that doesn’t violate our Community Guidelines. Over 70% of recommendations on election-related topics came from authoritative news sources and the top recommended videos and channels for election-related content were primarily authoritative news. In fact, the top 10 authoritative news channels were recommended over 14X more than the top 10 non-authoritative channels on election-related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these encouraging results, we recognize there's always more to do. For example, while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1% of what's watched on YouTube in the U.S., we know we can bring that number down even more. And some videos, while not recommended prominently on YouTube, continue to get high views, sometimes coming from other sites. We're continuing to consider this and other new challenges as we make ongoing improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections-related work. Our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn't abused to incite real-world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation. We welcome ongoing debate and discussion and will keep engaging with experts, researchers and organizations to ensure that our policies and products are meeting that goal. And as always, we'll apply learnings from this election to our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of elections around the world.<br></p></div>

      <section>
        <p>In my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">last post</a> I examined how first principles thinking fails. This post is going to be about a single, concrete example — about an argument that started me down this path in the first place.</p><p>A couple of months ago, a friend sent me a blog post titled <em><a href="https://ensorial.com/2020/dont-raise-money/">Startups Shouldn’t Raise Money</a></em>, over at a website called ensorial.com. I thought that the post was tightly argued and reasonably put together, with each proposition leading logically and coherently to the next. I also noticed that the author had taken the time to construct their argument from first principles … which meant it was difficult to refute any individual clause in their chain of reasoning.</p><p>But I also thought it was wrong. I told my friend as much.</p><p>“How is it wrong?” he immediately challenged.</p><p>“Well …” I began. And then I stopped. I realised I didn’t have a good argument for <em>why</em> it was wrong. Every axiom and intermediate proposition were ideas that I agreed with. And it wasn’t so simple as the conclusion being flat out mistaken — you <em>could</em> probably run a small, successful internet business using the ideas laid out in the posts’s argument (internet-based businesses tend to be simpler to manage, and there are many niches you can occupy).</p><p>But I felt uneasy because I thought the framing wasn’t as <em>useful</em>. This was a more complex thing to debunk.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2><p>It’s easy to think that arguments have just three terminal truth values: right, maybe, and wrong. In practice, arguments (and in particular, the sort of argument that we use to justify actions) have many possible truth values. These include things like ‘got the details wrong, but is by-and-large correct’, or ‘is correct but for a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-right-level-of-abstraction/">different level of abstraction</a>; doesn’t apply here’, or ‘is partially correct, but isn’t as useful compared to a different framing of things.’ The ensorial.com piece is interesting because I think it is an instance of that last one. It was what pushed me to start thinking about all the various ways first principles thinking could go wrong.</p><p>The author’s argument unfolds as follows:</p><ol><li>Startups are risky.</li><li>Raising capital to do a startup reduces skin in the game (you’re spending other people’s money, after all).</li><li>Once you have less skin in the game, it is easier to make bad decisions. The author argues this is due to a) having a capital buffer to cushion you, and b) having more time to waste.</li><li>The alternative is to forego raising venture capital and to create a sustainable business from the beginning, ‘growing linearly with the number of people that give you money for your product.’</li><li>This aligns incentives: you grow only by solving customer problems that they would pay you for. And you’ll pick the shortest path, because you don’t have the luxury of time given to you by an infusion of other people’s money.</li><li>Therefore: startups shouldn’t raise money.</li></ol><p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s explicitly <em>wrong</em> with this argument. I agree with all the base ideas, and I found myself nodding to the intermediate propositions. The logical correctness of the argument wasn’t a problem. No, my unease stemmed from experience: I <em>knew</em> this wasn’t the right way to think about raising capital. But I couldn’t begin to construct an argument that went against it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/argument_chain.f369ba07141442ea959636c21f56e207.png" alt=""></figure><p>My friend and I spent no more than 10 minutes discussing this piece. But in the months after our conversation, I continued to return to the author’s argument. I thought it was interesting because it represented a type of thinking error that you and I are likely to encounter in our lives. The form of the error is subtle, and therefore more difficult to detect; the best description I have for it is: ‘perfectly rational, logically constructed, and not really <em>wrong</em> — but not as useful or as powerful as some other framing.’</p><p>Of course, my obsession was for instrumental reasons: how might you recognise a better framing when you found one? I’ll admit that I was a little naive here: I thought that if I could generalise the structure of this argument, I would be better able to recognise similar errors in the future. Alas, I have not been able to do this to my satisfaction.</p><p>(In practice, most of the older entrepreneurs I know seem to understand the problems with such sensemaking. Plausible arguments are dealt with in a simple manner: you try the recommendations that unfold from the analysis, but you remain alert to see if they give you exactly the results you want. If they don’t, you keep the frame for the time being, but you continue to look out for a better explanation. And how would you know if you have found a better way of thinking about your situation? Simple: you listen carefully. In the words of Malaysian magnate Robert Kuok, “you learn to distill wisdom from the air.”)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The most I’ve been able to do is to articulate <em>how</em> the author messed up — and therefore how first principles thinking may fail — something that I <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">explored in my previous post</a>. The core idea is simple: I believe the author started from a limited set of axioms. If you start from a wrong set of axioms, you would eventually end up with a flawed conclusion. In this case, I think the ensorial.com author started from a deficient understanding of business.</p><p>To generalise a little, people with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits. But those who actually run businesses know that running a business is all about managing cash flows.</p><p>And the ensorial.com author’s argument fails because he doesn’t appear to understand this.</p><h2 id="john-malone-and-the-invention-of-ebitda">John Malone and the Invention of EBITDA</h2><p>In 1972, a 32 year old man named John Malone was offered the top job at Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), a cable company. He took charge on April Fool’s Day, 1973.</p><p>At the time of his hiring, Malone was president of Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument that supplied cable boxes and credit to the cable systems companies. He had been offered the Jerrold Electronics job when he was 29 years old, just two years earlier. Before JE, he was at McKinsey Consulting. And before McKinsey, he had a job at AT&amp;T’s famed Bell Labs, where he applied operations research to find optimal company strategies in monopoly markets. Malone concluded that AT&amp;T should increase its debt load and aggressively reduce its equity base through share repurchases — a highly unorthodox recommendation at the time. His advice was delivered to AT&amp;T’s board and then promptly ignored.</p><p>Malone had been thinking about the interplay between debt, profit, cash flow, and corporate taxes for some time. In 1972, when he was first offered the TCI job, he had already noticed a number of structural properties in the cable industry that piqued his interest:</p><ol><li>The cable industry had highly predictable subscription revenues. Cable television customers in the 60s — especially those in rural communities — were eager to upgrade to cable for better TV reception. These subscribers paid monthly fees and rarely cancelled.</li><li>Cable franchises were essentially a legal right to a local monopoly, which meant that cable system operators had limited competition once it established itself in a given locale.</li><li>The industry itself had very favourable tax characteristics — smart cable operators could shelter their cash flow from taxes by using debt to build new systems, and by aggressively depreciating the costs of construction. Once the depreciation ran out on particular systems, they could then sell them to another operator, where the depreciation clock would start anew.</li><li>Most importantly, the entire market was growing like a weed: over the course of the 60s and into the start of the 70s, subscriber counts had grown over twentyfold.</li></ol><p>Of course, Malone didn’t have much time to reflect on these observations. He landed at TCI and found the company at the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p>Bob Magness, the founder of TCI, had grown the company over the course of two decades using a ridiculous pile of debt — about 17 times revenues, at the time of Malone’s hiring. Malone spent his first couple of years at TCI fighting to keep the company alive. He flew into New York every couple of weeks, hat in hand, renegotiating <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp">covenants</a> and asking for extensions on debt repayments. At one point during a meeting with TCI’s bankers, Malone threw his keys on the table and threatened to walk, leaving the company to the banks. The bankers capitulated, granting TCI a much needed extension.</p><p>Malone and Magness also had to worry about hostile takeovers, given TCI’s low stock price in the early 70s. They executed a series of complicated financial manoeuvres a year or so after Malone took over, placing a large chunk of stock in a holding company to grant them majority control. Later, they created a separate class of voting stock. These moves gave them hard control of the company, allowing Malone the freedom to focus on righting its finances.</p><p>After three years of hell, TCI was finally pulled back from the brink of financial disaster. And then Malone got to work.</p><p>Malone understood a few things about the cable industry that many outsiders didn’t. First, he understood that cable was like real estate: incredibly high fixed costs up front as you built or bought the systems, and then highly predictable, monopoly cash flows for a long time afterwards. He understood that if he used debt to finance acquisitions, he could keep growing the company, and use the depreciation on acquired systems (plus the write-offs from the loans itself) to delay paying taxes on that cash flow. Third, Malone understood that untaxed cash flows from all of those cable subscribers could be used to a) service the debt, b) pay down some of those loans — only when necessary; Malone wanted to keep the debt-to-earnings ratio at a five-to-one level — but more importantly c) demonstrate to creditors that TCI was a worthy debtor. And finally, Malone understood the benefits of size: the larger TCI got, the lower the cost of acquiring programming (i.e. shows and programs), because it could amortise those costs across its entire subscriber …</p></section></div></div>

        <p>Opening a page in the Google Cloud Console always takes a long time.</p>
<p>Here are some metrics I collected on a high-end 2018 MacBook Pro on a UK-based Gigabit internet connection.</p>

<div id="slow-gcp-table">
<table>
<thead>

</table>
</div>
<p>Download size is the compressed size, JavaScript size is uncompressed. Main Content is the time when e.g. the Cloud Functions become visible, Fully Loaded is when no more changes are made to the UI.</p>

<p>We can see that each page loads over 15 MB of JavaScript code. A look at the performance timeline in Chrome DevTools confirms that running this code is the primary cause of the poor page performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/timeline.png" alt="DevTools CPU timeline showing a large amount of JavaScript work"></p>
<p>This article will take a closer look at the page load process of the Google Cloud Functions page, and examine how it could be sped up.</p>
<p>You can use these strategies to investigate and improve the performance of the apps you're working on.</p>
<h2 id="loading-the-html-document">Loading the HTML document</h2>
<p>The initial HTML request is very fast and only takes about 150ms. It contains an embedded SVG spinner that shows while the first chunk of JavaScript code is loading.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-spinner.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="loading-the-initial-java-script-bundles">Loading the initial JavaScript bundles</h2>
<p>These are the first two JavaScript bundles the page starts loading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>routemap</strong> 21 KB (103 KB uncompressed)</li>
<li><strong>core,pm_ng1_bootstrap</strong> 1.3 MB (4.8 MB uncompressed)</li>
</ul>
<p>These files don't take too long to download, but running the code freezes the UI for a while. The spinner SVG becomes stuck at this point, until it's replaced by a skeleton UI for Google Cloud Console page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-initial-load.png" alt="Filmstrip showing initial rendering of the GCP page"></p>
<p>Here's what happens when the browser wants to run some JavaScript code.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parsing</strong> (done lazily at first, and then as needed later on)</li>
<li><strong>Compilation</strong> (also happens lazily)</li>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong> –&nbsp;the browser runs module initialization code, i.e. code that runs when loading a module rather than when calling one of its functions</li>
<li><strong>Running core app code</strong> – renders the application using the initialized modules</li>
</ol>
<p>For the whole Google Cloud page, just parsing the source code takes 250ms, and compilation takes another 750ms (not including the 113 ms spent on "Compile Script").</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/devtools-profile.png" alt="DevTools profile showing a breakdown of CPU activity"></p>
<p>The initial render of the Angular app takes about 1s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/initial-bundle.png" alt="JavaScript execution flamechart"></p>
<p>Eventually we start to see a new spinner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/second-spinner.png" alt="Page frame and new spinner"></p>
<h2 id="loading-page-bundles">Loading page bundles</h2>
<p>Once the generic Google Cloud UI is rendered the page starts loading 18 additional JavaScript files with an overall size of 1.5 MB.</p>
<p>Making a lot of separate requests isn't actually a problem though – it can improve performance by increasing the likelinhood of cache hits, and splitting up bundles makes it easy to load only necessary code.</p>
<p>After loading the first set up bundles the app starts making fetch requests and loads 3 more bundles at a total size of 6 MB.</p>
<p>When loading the page on my normal network the requests all kind of blurred together and it was hard to see which requests were sequential. So this screenshot shows the request chart on a throttled connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/more-page-bundles.png" alt="Request waterfall showing three sets of JavaScript being loaded sequentially"></p>
<h2 id="loading-the-list-of-cloud-functions">Loading the list of Cloud Functions</h2>
<p>The request loading the list of Cloud Functions takes about 700ms. But it doesn't start as soon as the bundles are loaded, in part because there's a <code>testIamPermissions</code> request that needs to finish first.</p>
<p>As a result the CPU ends up being idle for half a second –&nbsp;this time could be used better if the request started sooner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/loading-functions.png" alt="Waterfall showing requests made to load the list of cloud functions"></p>
<p>Finally the app re-renders and we get the list of Cloud Functions we wanted to see.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/cloud-functions.png" alt="Page showing GCP Cloud Functions"></p>

<p>Chrome DevTools has a code coverage tool tracks which parts of the code actually run on the current page. This can help identify code that doesn't have to be loaded.</p>
<p>The Cloud Functions page runs 53% of the JavaScript code it downloads. This is actually a bit disappointing, as it means that even if only necessary code is loaded it would still only cut the total JavaScript size of the page in half.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-coverage.png" alt="Chrome DevTools Code Coverage tool"></p>
<h2 id="moving-configuration-into-json">Moving configuration into JSON</h2>
<p>A good amount of the code actually consists of configuration objects. For example, this 200 KB object with 4997 keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/configuration.png" alt="Configuration object in a JavaScript bundle"></p>
<p>Loading this as a JSON string with <code>JSON.parse</code> could be faster, as JSON is simpler to parse than a JavaScript object. This would be easy to do, but might not result in a huge performance improvement.</p>
<p>Ideally the app wouldn't need to load the full list on the client, but this would be harder to implement.</p>
<h2 id="reduce-code-duplication">Reduce code duplication</h2>
<p>The 200KB JSON object above is actually included in two of the JavaScript bundles. Breaking it out and reusing it would save download and processing time.</p>
<p>The same seems to apply to a bunch of UI components, like this one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-duplication.png" alt="Duplicate code in DevTools code search"></p>
<h2 id="prioritize-primary-content">Prioritize primary content</h2>
<p>The Google Cloud page loads a large initial JavaScript bundle. The longer it takes to load and initialize this code, the longer it takes to load page-specific code and to render the list of Cloud Functions the user wants to see.</p>
<p>But the initial bundle also contains secondary content, like the complex navigation sidebar. This menu becomes functional before the main page content is loaded, but it should only be loaded after the primary content.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/prioritize-primary-content.png" alt="Sidebar menu is open while main content is still loading"></p>
<p>Google Cloud already does this in some cases. For example, the page initially renders a simpler version of the header and then loads more complex features later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/header.png" alt="Header doesn't show project dropdown at first and then shows it later"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the performance of static pages tends to be dominated by render-blocking network requests, single-page apps are often blocked by JavaScript execution or loading account data.</p>
<p>Downloading large amounts of code can hurt performance on slow connections, but due to compression and caching CPU processing often has a greater impact.</p>

Most off-the-shelf providers like Shopify and BigCommerce are built for small stores selling a few million dollars in orders per month, so many e-commerce retailers working at scale start to investigate creating a bespoke solution.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This article will look at what it takes to start building this infrastructure on your own. What are some of the areas to consider? What might the data model look like? How much work is involved?</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll explore an alternative: API-based commerce platforms that manage data for you across product catalogs, pricing, and orders—without locking you into a monolith, and without requiring you to replatform.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> A full summary diagram of the e-commerce data model is at the end of the article.</em></p>

<h2 id="who-are-your-customers-">Who Are Your Customers?</h2>
<p>First, you need to consider <em>who</em> will be purchasing items from your e-commerce application. How might you model customer information in a database as a result? You’ll probably want to have basic information like your customer's name, email address, etc. Do you want your customers to be able to create a profile in your system? Or just fill out a form each time they want to purchase something?</p>
<p>Just starting out, a basic model might look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="Basic e-commerce customer data model" width="308" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=154&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 154w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 308w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=462&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 462w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=616&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 616w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=770&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 770w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=924&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px"></p>
<p>If you want your customers to have a persistent profile, then you need to build some way for them to log in to your application. Moving forward with more real-world requirements, you might also want to keep track of their login attempt history and password history.</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce customer data model" width="891" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=446&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 446w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 891w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1337&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1337w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1782&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1782w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2228&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2228w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2673&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2673w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></p>
<p>You might also want to consider whether your customers are part of a large organization; and, if so, how would they like to handle password resets? Do they need single sign-on or OAuth support?</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-addresses">Deep Dive: Addresses</h4>
<p>Did you notice there’s no address tied to a customer in any of the data models shown so far? It might be your first inclination to include a customer’s address as part of those models. However, most customers will have multiple addresses and multiple <em>kinds</em> of addresses, like billing and shipping. B2B retailers might also have to consider multiple delivery locations based on the number of warehouses and offices they support.</p>
<p>What happens if the billing and shipping address are different? Well, you’ll need to do more than just add extra columns to the <code>Customer</code> table! It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>So how <em>does</em> storing a billing address affect the scalability of your application?</p>
<p>If you were to split the payment and shipping areas into separate (micro)services each having their own database, then putting billing and payment addresses into the <code>Customer</code> area would lead to having “chatty” services. This is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/chattiness.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-known <em>design smell</em> when building microservices</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, you’re better off putting the addresses within the appropriate area/service that requires them, but with that, your data model becomes more complex.</p>
<p>One way to avoid much of this complexity is to consider an <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/oms-software" rel="noopener">order management system (OMS)</a> by an API-first software provider. With this software, you can integrate the OMS into your data model without spending months of engineering time.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-organize-products-and-catalog-">How Do You Organize Products And Catalog?</h2>
<p>The first thing you see when you enter a store (either in-person or digitally) are products ready for you to purchase, and usually displayed with some thought for how you might be likely to shop.</p>
<p>For an e-commerce web application, you will probably want to highlight things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best selling products</li>
<li>Trending products</li>
<li>New products</li>
<li>The ability to browse products by search criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing customers with that information means you first need to keep track of a lot of data about your products: their prices, historical purchase data, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a “first shot” at creating a data model for a product catalog might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="Simple e-commerce product data model" width="562" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=281&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 281w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 562w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=843&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 843w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1124&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1124w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1405&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1405w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1686&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1686w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"></p>
<p>Here’s a <code>Product</code> table with some basic information, like a product’s name, SKU, and price. The product is also linked to another table representing various categories that product is associated with. You might also strategically add indexes and full-text search to the <code>Product</code> table to enable site visitors to efficiently search for various products.</p>
<p>This is a decent first attempt. However, to get an even more realistic and useful e-commerce product catalog, you’ll need to support more requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking pricing history so site administrators can analyze trends in product pricing</li>
<li>Supporting related products to display on a product’s page</li>
<li>Incorporating product vendors so customers can view all products sold by an individual vendor/company</li>
</ul>
<p>To address those extra requirements, you might end up with the following data model:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce product data model" width="816" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=408&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 408w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 816w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1224&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1632&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1632w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2040&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2040w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2448&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2448w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px"></p>
<p>This model still isn’t perfect as it embeds your prices into the product itself, but at least it lets you maintain a previous pricing history.</p>
<p>Another option is to integrate your e-commerce store with a <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/promotions-engine" rel="noopener">pricing and promotions engine</a> from an API-first software provider that handles pricing for you. This will let you roll out different prices to different users based on their intent, location, cart, or order history.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-pricing">Deep Dive: Pricing</h4>
<p>While the more complex product data model still has a product’s price in the same table, this may not be the best thing to do in a real large-scale application.</p>
<p>Consider that your organization has various departments, such as inventory/warehousing, sales, marketing, customer support, etc. You might have dedicated systems that allow merchandisers to change the price of an item since they are the experts in determining how much a product should sell for. Similar to the considerations with a customer’s billing and shipping addresses, this would lead to cross-boundary/service communication if we left the price in the core <code>Product</code> table.</p>
<p>Therefore, you might want to store product prices under the data stores that the sales department owns. But don’t forget, there are many different kinds of “prices” that haven’t been taken into consideration yet, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price (cost) when purchasing stock from vendors</li>
<li>Customer sale price</li>
<li>Discounted sale prices</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s suggested retail price</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling all these in context of your organizational structure would require even more exploration and complexity in your data model. While your engineering team could likely accomplish this task, it’s going to take time. Using ready-made solutions can shave weeks or months off your e-commerce data modeling timeline.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-streamline-orders-">How Do You Streamline Orders?</h2>
<p>Now that you have customers in your database and products available to purchase, you’ll need to think about how to design the order-taking process and data model.</p>
<p>The process of placing an order might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer places products into their cart while browsing.</li>
<li>The customer decides they want to purchase the products that are in their cart.</li>
<li>They proceed to purchase the order.</li>
<li>The customer gets an emailed receipt or confirmation number.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s rarely so simple. Placing orders can be deceptively tricky as there are many moving parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>An active cart</li>
<li>Cart converted into an order</li>
<li>A finalized order with confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to look at a simple data model for an order placement, it might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png" alt="Orders data model" width="837" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=419&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 419w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 837w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1256&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1256w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1674&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1674w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2093&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2093w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2511&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2511w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"></p>
<p>Notice that each row in the <code>ShoppingCartItem</code> table contains the “captured” price of the product. When the customer puts an item into their shopping cart should the price at that moment be “locked-in”? If so, for how long?</p>
<p><em><span>Note:</span> How the price functions is a business requirement that would need to be discussed with your product owners, and so on, as mentioned in the "Deep Dive: Pricing" section earlier.</em></p>
<p>The same question applies to an unpaid order. If a customer has ordered a discounted item, should they be able to keep the promise of that discounted price forever until they pay? Or does it expire?</p>
<p>Other questions to consider for an orders data model might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you tracking analytics on orders?</li>
<li>What happens if a customer returns a defective item?</li>
<li>Should you handle shipping within the same data model or have a dedicated shipping context/schema?</li>
</ul>
<p>With some of these concerns in mind, you might end up with a data model that looks more like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex orders data model" width="1112" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=556&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 556w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1112w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1668&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1668w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2224&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2780&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2780w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=3336&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 3336w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></p>
<p>Some things to take note of in this more complex orders model:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShoppingCartItem</code> now supports an expiration date for a locked-in price.</li>
<li><code>ShoppingCartHistory</code> tracks when items are added, removed, etc.</li>
<li>An order item may be returned (this still does not handle cases where 1 out of X items of the same product are returned).</li>
<li>An order may have multiple shipments (eg, how Amazon will sometimes split an order up into multiple packages/shipments).</li>
</ul>
<p>This article also hasn’t even touched the surface of using alternative data storage methods like JSON documents or event sourcing!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To help you see how all the pieces fit together, here are all the diagrams shown together. I’ve removed a number of links/lines to the <code>Customer</code> table to increase readability:</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, this article still doesn’t even cover many of the basics like payment processing and invoicing. Beyond the features covered here, you might eventually require more advanced features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupon codes</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Third-party integrations with OAuth providers, other retailers, or partners</li>
<li>Shipment tracking notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a data model for an e-commerce application, as you can see, is not so simple. What looks up front to be a straightforward set of database tables is not so simple once you dig into real-world requirements.</p>
<h4 id="there-s-another-way">There’s Another Way</h4>
<p>What if you could have more of these abilities out-of-the-box?</p>
<p><a href="https://fabric.inc/solutions">Fabric</a> is an all-in-one commerce platform that helps you do everything this article talked about, like manage customers, orders, and shipments. Most importantly, it is a microservices-based and API-first platform.

<br/>
December 8, 2020 | https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p>Today's article is about working with external volumes for your
unikernel instance. Many applications won't use this feature but there
are also situations where this makes sense.</p>

<p>The most obvious time when you would want to attach a volume to your
unikernel instance is when you are working with a database. Your
database image probably doesn't change that much but many databases can
grow very large and it makes no sense to keep the same data volume in
your base image.</p>

<p>The second use-case is when you have a base image, say a webserver,
and you want to package additional files or configuation as a build
step. For instance some companies will rotate certificates every few
hours in the day to protect access to various services and this rotation
is usually done out-of-band of deploys. Now unikernel deploys for small
webservers are typically fairly fast but the ability to put your
configuration on a separate partition and re-mount the volume on the fly
every few hours is definitely enticing.</p>

<p>Ok, let's start with the code. For this example we have a simple
little go webserver that implements a root filesystem filewalker. We've
declared that there is a separate partition called 'mnt' in the code but
it is non-existent right now.</p>

<pre><code>import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "net/http"
  "os"
  "path/filepath"
)

func printDir() {
  err := filepath.Walk("/",
    func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
      fmt.Println(path, info.Size())
      return nil
    })
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}

func main() {
  printDir()

  b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(b))

  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    printDir()

    b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(string(b))
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to my website!")
  })

  fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static/"))
  http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fs))

  go func() {
    err = http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }
  }()

  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
</code></pre><p>

If you run it locally you should see something like this:
</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

/sys/devices/system/cpu/online 0
open /mnt/bob.txt: no such file or directory
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating a Volume</h3>

<p>Let's create a simple volume with one file in it - bob.txt.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir mnt
echo "Hi - I'm a text file" &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:12:35 volume: mnt created with UUID 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e and label mnt
</code></pre><p>

You'll see that we can now see it in our local volume store:

</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops volume list
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
|                 UUID                 | NAME | STATUS | SIZE (GB) | LOCATION                                 | CREATED | ATTACHED |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
| 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e | mnt  |        | 1.6 MB    | /Users/eyberg/.ops/volumes/mnt:04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e.raw |         |          |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
</code></pre>

<h3>Attaching a Volume</h3>

<p>You can attach a volume to an instance that is expecting one. So that
means when we create the image we'll want to pass any mount points with
the volume label and mount path - this is loosely similar to how
something in /etc/fstab would work. Ran locally you can test with 'ops
run' but you can pass the same '--mounts' flag when issuing 'ops image
create' for images ran on Google or AWS. Let's try it out locally:
</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt:/mnt
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

/sys/devices/system/cpu 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online 0
Hi - I'm a text file
</code></pre>

<p>Cool! It works! Now let's edit the file.</p>

<pre><code>echo "New text has come to light." &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt2 -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:19:41 volume: mnt2 created with UUID f82da0e3-3980-ddd8-5720-e1b320e21371 and label mnt2
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind we are creating a *new* volume with new contents and then re-attaching the volume to the instance.</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt2:/mnt
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

/sys/devices/system/cpu 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online 0
New text has come to light.
</code></pre>

<p>If you are attaching the volume to an instance on Google or AWS you'd
use the attach command:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume attach g2 mnt mnt2 -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you can detach as well:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume detach g2 mnt -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>What's really great about unikernel volumes when working on AWS or
Google is that this is all managed for you by the cloud provider of choice. There is no duplicate storage layer
you have to manage like you do in container land. Now you know the basics of mounting external volumes into your unikernel images.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 8, 2020 | https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

          <h2 id="changing-license-from-gplv3-to-apache-20-terminusdb">Changing License from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0: TerminusDB</h2>

<p>We have decided to re-license TerminusDB from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0. We want independent software developers (ISVs) to embed TerminusDB in their applications and those developers feel that Apache is a lower risk option. The substantive points of practical difference are far less important – sufficient people believe it to be true and sufficient lawyers have advised teams to be wary of GPL.</p>

<p>In our experience, ISVs and devs in large companies/institutions size up their options at project conception and there remains a niggling doubt that ‘GPL might limit commercial prospects and cause me headaches’. The world has changed – and code freedom is being overtaken by developer freedom.</p>

<p>Open-source software is everywhere. It’s eating the world. In the top 10 databases on <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">DB-Engines</a>, the remaining proprietary databases were released in 1980 (Oracle), 1983 (IBM Db2) and 1989 (Microsoft SQL Server). It is hard to imagine another non-OSS database ever entering the top 10.</p>

<p>We had hoped that our association with the principals of the free software movement would result in community adoption and contribution, but that hasn’t really been the case. We see limited community input that relates to our choice of GPL. That might not be too surprising as when you investigate which license to choose on Stackoverflow, you get popular but wrong-headed comments like:</p>

<p><code>the GNU/GPL bunch are generally extremists when you encounter them in the wild.</code></p>

<p><code>don’t use GPL if you want your project to be commercial</code></p>

<p>With the shift to Apache, TerminusDB is, in a sense, becoming more open source as we are removing restrictions on how you can use the software.</p>

<h3 id="debate">Debate</h3>

<p>The core TerminusDB team had a long debate about licenses before the release of 1.0 last year. The main topics of discussion were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The risks of a cloud provider forking the code then hosting the database</li>
<li>What open source means to TerminusDB as a group</li>
<li>What we, as a community of devs and users, are most comfortable with</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-the-big-bad-cloud-providers">1. The big bad cloud providers</h4>

<p>In the past there was an unwritten rule, that big platforms wouldn’t come along and fork open source code and deliver the same product as a service. Unfortunately, those days are gone. AWS in particular has actively sought to offer very similar services to open source products. This led to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/">Confluent</a> (among others) changing their licences to variations of ‘server side’ and moving away from the open-source tradition. They try to say ‘we are still open source, we are just forbidding a specific type of action’, but it can feel like window dressing for ‘we want to sweat our assets’.</p>

<p>Mongo, for example, is hardly suffering – it’s valued at over $15 billion. With such vast resources, they should be (and are) able to compete in the provision of their own database. MongoDB’s technology is more than competitive with AWS’ DocumentDB, and Mongo’s Atlas DBaaS - which runs on AWS infra - has been a huge success.</p>

<p>I’m sure our perspective will shift over time, but from where we’re standing, having a cloud provider launch a competing service would be a sign of enormous success. (And this is not to say that the cloud providers’ parasitic approach to OSS projects is not a genuine problem, it simply acknowledges that you have to be a widely used OSS project before it *becomes* a problem).</p>

<h3 id="2-free-software">2. Free software</h3>

<p>We don’t think it should be our job to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We do think that the software community should be able to access and use TerminusDB.</p>

<p>In 1974 software became copyrightable in the USA. It subsequently became obvious that researchers were giving out software for free, but businesses were not giving back. GNU/GPL came along to provide a new framework for that interface – the software would be free as in freedom (libre). Everybody would be free to modify and distribute, but proprietary additions would not be allowed.</p>

<p>The problem of businesses not giving back remains today.</p>

<p>GPL and copyleft provisions work well when they dominate open-source, but their waning popularity increases the ability for ISVs and corporates to go for more open licensing and for legal teams to write anti-GPL provisions into internal rules. Only significant developer push back can change that reality (and why push back when there are so many OSS options with permissive licenses).</p>

<p>Maybe if <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MySQL">MySQL</a>, its offshoot <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MariaDB">MariaDB</a>, and our graph brothers <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/Neo4j">Neo4j</a> weren’t the only GPL flag flyers in the top 20 databases, it might be easier to gain adoption with GPL; however, the other big OSS players: Postgres, Cassandra, Elastic &amp; Redis all go for less restrictive licenses.</p>

<p>The Affero GPL (AGPL) is treated as an even greater pariah than the GPLv3. The Google internal policy] bans all use of AGPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It reminds of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13421608">this HN comment</a> on the <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">excellent postmortem</a> of the demise of RethinkDB (recommended reading for all OSS folk):</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-hn.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Our graph database brothers and sisters in <a href="https://neo4j.com/open-core-and-neo4j/">Neo4j moved</a> from the AGPL to ‘AGPL with a commons clause’ to GPLv3 to making some of the code proprietary. Getting the right license for an OSS project that also allows for some commercialization is far from straightforward. (As Neo certainly know – check out this <a href="https://public.igovsol.com/neo4j-court-records/graphfoundation/80-main.pdf">current court case about the formerly GPL enterprise code</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn">Grakn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree/db">Fluree</a> are seeing some success with the AGPL. We genuinely wish them well as we know it is a hard path to walk.</p>



<p>We did get some negative feedback about the GPL prior to launch. Some people working in corporates weren’t comfortable and thought that it would prevent them from using Terminus. Our response was – <strong>we didn’t develop for them</strong>. And that remains the case; however, the GPL skeptical environment is pervasive. There is a person who tweets TerminusDB after every release asking when the Apache version will land – I always ask him why he thinks he needs an Apache version and he doesn’t really know… though he has a vague feeling that the application he builds on top will be less valuable.</p>

<p>We thought we would focus on the cloud offering – <a href="https://terminusdb.com/hub/">TerminusHub</a>, which, as SaaS built on the database, has the benefit of being an in-house ‘product’ that doesn’t worry about the license of the underlying software. However, the community wants to build applications on the software and we want to offer an easy way to build a version control and collaboration layer into ISV applications. We think TerminusDB is the perfect infrastructure to build the next <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. We worry about the syncing, versioning and data collaboration – you worry about your users.</p>

<h3 id="why-shift-licenses">Why shift Licenses</h3>

<p>We do not think that our job is to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We still believe that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">“the fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs.”</a></p>

<p>We would welcome a GPL fork of the TerminusDB code – we are happy to work with any such project should it emerge.</p>

<p>But we wish to build a community first and foremost. In order to facilitate that community, we will be moving to Apache 2.0 immediately.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to focus on creating a great open-source database and allow everybody to use that software in their projects.</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This post is co-authored by George Fraser, the CEO of <a href="http://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, and Arjun Narayan, the CEO of Materialize. This blog post is cross-posted <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/kafka-is-not-a-database">on the Fivetran blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s important to understand the uses and abuses of streaming infrastructure.</p>
<p>Apache Kafka is a message broker that has rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years. Message brokers have been around for a long time; they’re a type of datastore specialized for “buffering” messages between producer and consumer systems. Kafka has become popular because it’s open-source and capable of scaling to very large numbers of messages.</p>
<p>Message brokers are classically used to decouple producers and consumers of data. For example, at Fivetran, we use a message broker similar to Kafka to buffer customer-generated webhooks before loading them in batches into your data warehouse:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" alt="A Message Broker Used as a buffer before loading into a data warehouse" width="960" height="124" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w"></p>
<p>In this scenario, the message broker is providing durable storage of events between when a customer sends them, and when Fivetran loads them into the data warehouse.</p>
<p>However, Kafka has occasionally been described as something much more than just a better message broker. Proponents of this viewpoint position Kafka as a fundamentally new way of managing data, where <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka replaces the relational database as the definitive record of what has happened</a>. Instead of reading and writing a traditional database, you append events to Kafka, and read from downstream views that represent the present state. This architecture has been described as “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning the database inside out</a>“.</p>
<p>In principle, it is possible to implement this architecture in a way that supports both reads and writes. However, during that process you will eventually confront every hard problem that database management systems have faced for decades. You will more or less have to write a full-fledged DBMS in your application code. And you will probably not do a great job, because databases take years to get right. You will have to deal with dirty reads, phantom reads, write skew, and all the other symptoms of a hastily implemented database.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with using Kafka as your primary data store is it provides no isolation. Isolation means that, globally, all transactions (reads and writes) occur along some consistent history. Jepsen provides a <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">guide</a> of isolation levels (inhabiting an isolation level means that the system will never encounter certain anomalies).</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example of why isolation is important: suppose we’re running an online store. When a user checks out, we want to make sure all their items are actually in stock. The way to do this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the inventory level for each item in the user’s cart.</li>
<li>If an item is no longer available, abort the checkout.</li>
<li>If all items are available, subtract them from the inventory and confirm the checkout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we are using Kafka to manage this process. Our architecture might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" alt="A microservice workflow for processing checkouts" width="960" height="753" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w"></p>
<p>The web server reads the inventory level from a view downstream from Kafka, but it can only commit the transaction <em>upstream</em> in the checkouts topic. The problem is one of <strong>concurrency control</strong>: if there are two users racing to buy the last item, <em>only one must succeed</em>. We need to read the inventory view and confirm the checkout at <em>a single point in time</em>. However, there is no way to do this in this architecture.</p>
<p>The problem we now have is called <a href="http://justinjaffray.com/what-does-write-skew-look-like/">write skew</a>. Our reads from the inventory view can be out of date by the time the checkout event is processed. If two users try to buy the same item at nearly the same time, they will both succeed, and we won’t have enough inventory for them both.</p>
<p>Event-sourced architectures like these suffer many such isolation anomalies, which constantly gaslight users with “time travel” behavior that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unread+notification+glitch">we’re all familiar with</a>. Even worse, research shows that anomaly-permitting architectures create outright security holes that allow hackers to steal data, as covered in <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/acid-rain/">this excellent blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/acidrain-sigmod2017.pdf">this research paper.</a></p>

<p>These problems can be avoided if you use Kafka as a <em>complement</em> to a traditional database:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" alt="kafka used for Change Data Capture from an OLTP database" width="960" height="658" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w"></p>
<p>OLTP databases perform a crucial task that message brokers are not well suited to provide: admission control of events. Rather than using a message broker as a receptacle for “fire and forget” events, forcing your event schema into an “intent pattern”, an OLTP database can <em>deny</em> events that conflict, ensuring that only a single consistent stream of events are ever emitted. OLTP databases are really good at this core <strong>concurrency control</strong> task – scaling to many millions of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Using a database as the point-of-entry for writes, the best way to extract events from a database is via streaming <strong>change-data-capture</strong>. There are several great open CDC frameworks like <a href="http://debezium.io/">Debezium</a> and <a href="http://maxwells-daemon.io/">Maxwell</a>, as well as native CDC from <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/change-data-capture.html">modern</a> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28313/cdc.htm">SQL</a> <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/architecture/docdb-replication/change-data-capture/">databases</a>. Change-data-capture also sets up an elegant operational story. In recovery scenarios, everything can be purged downstream and rebuilt from the (very durable) OLTP database.</p>

<p>The database community has learned (and re-learned) several important lessons over decades. Each one of these lessons was obtained at the high prices of data corruption, data loss, and numerous user-facing anomalies. The last thing you want to do is to find yourself relearning these lessons because you <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491944608/video244677.html">accidentally misbuilt a database</a>.</p>
<p>Real-time streaming message brokers are a great tool for managing high-velocity data. But you will still need a traditional DBMS for isolating transactions. The best reference architecture for “turning your database inside out” is to use OLTP databases for admission control, use CDC for event generation, and model downstream copies of the data as materialized views.</p>

    <h2>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Ard<br>}</h2><br>
  <h2>Little Tasks, Little Trust</h2>
  <h3>How Delegating Responsibilities is Better Than Managing By Tasks</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Trust is the highest form of motivation. It brings out the very
    best in people.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    --Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It’s basically a sacred project management mantra by
now: <strong>divide your work into tasks that are as small as
possible</strong>. Estimate them with your team. Then drop them into
the all-knowing product backlog. But no one seems to be looking very
critically at how this practice has affected the software engineering
profession. Back in the 90’s, when I started programming, this was not
how it worked. It was, dare I say, a little more
professional.</p><p>Back then, your boss had a dozen or more things
they were responsible for and when you got hired they breathed a deep
sigh of relief.</p><p>“Finally, now that Vincent is here, I can make
him do A and B; and with Ted doing C, D, and E and Jan doing F, G, and
H, I can finally get to I, J, K, L, and M.”</p><p>Most importantly, A
and B were big things, like whole products or large system
libraries. Building and maintaining them consumed all of your
time. They were your delegated responsibilities, not mere tasks. It
wasn’t that hard to manage people this way either. If you weren’t
doing a good job, the boss would let you know.</p><p>“Hey, Vincent, A
isn’t turning out quite like I was imagining. Can you do a little more
of this — and definitely more cowbell.”</p><p>Then you went back to
your private office (I sure miss private offices, but that is a topic
for another day) and fixed a few things. Later, in a weekly status
meeting you would tell people how it went — yep, that’s right, no
daily stand-ups where you look mournfully at your shoes and admit that
you didn’t make any notable progress yet.</p><p>No backlog grooming
meetings or burn-down charts either. Your manager simply looked at
how <em>your </em>products were coming along. A little trust, some
accountability, and a healthy portion of “give me some space to do my
work.”</p><p>The way we work now is different. Sadly, it’s less
motivating, less efficient, and profoundly less respectful of
individual abilities.</p><h3>whose vision is it again?</h3><p>As I
see it, little tasks are born of a fundamentally different management
attitude. Small tasks are a not-so-subtle way of saying that all the
product vision lies with management. Keep away. Don’t
touch.</p><p>While larger tasks send a completely different
message. Here, management is giving you bigger pieces to chew on,
inviting you to mix some of your own creativity with the end
product. You get to do some design work, think about what the customer
needs, and take pride in what comes out the other end. Sure, the
organization has an overarching strategy, but they still want people
to take on responsibilities, not just errands. They trust you to align
with the overall vision and because you feel like you are part of the
“club”, you actually want to.</p><h3>too much love for the
metrics</h3><p>Small tasks have also taken hold because they fit
nicely with the age-old assembly-line mentality. Sadly, there are
armies of managers that still live by that dogma. For them, it is all
about picking <em>metrics and optimizing them </em>— management by
chart and graph.</p><p>Unfortunately, little tasks in Jira (or any of
the dozens of other issue tracking systems out there) bring the
promise of a whole host of tasty new charts and graphs: burn-down,
burn-up, velocity, lead-time, cycle time, task age, throughput, failed
deployment, flow and control. It’s as irresistible as candy to a
baby.</p><p>But, assigning responsibilities instead of tasks takes
away an assembly-line manager’s favorite tools. Because they are
larger, responsibilities can’t be so easily measured and tracked. So
metrics-managers will fight both tooth and nail to keep your work divided
and cataloged in tiny, traceable instructions.</p><h3>when will I get some design
experience?</h3><p>Sadly, as developers, we do it to ourselves as
well. Once someone gives us a better title, we are right on board with
the program. When a regular developer might have had a chance to do
some research or design, we immediately snatch it away for
ourselves.</p><p>As technical management, we standardize our
frameworks, languages, deployment operating systems, and cloud service
providers. We write wrappers around networking, logging, and
monitoring libraries and demand they always be used. Then, after we
have taken the task of designing and researching the CI/CD tools and
pipeline, we write coding standards for our coding
standards.</p><p>Worse yet, we design every product’s architecture,
and expect any deviation to be approved by us first. All that is left
are tiny morsels. Grunt work for the foot soldiers once the fun has
been stripped away.</p><p>Poor front-line programmers are left
wide-eyed with empty bowls, asking “please sir, can I have some more?
I just wanted to design one little service. I know I am not worthy,
but can I please just write my own sql queries without using that
awful ORM?  PLEASE?”</p><p>Sadly, when those poor programmers finally
seek promotion, hoping for their first real shot at higher level
engagement, they are rebuffed: “You don’t really have any design
experience I am afraid. We are looking for someone who has designed
large systems.”</p><p>To their managers they could rightfully reply,
“that was your doing, not mine!”</p><h3>estimation is never
free</h3><p>There is a grave misconception circulating that if you
just sit down, in a comfy conference room chair, and split a project
into tiny tasks, small enough to be individually estimated,
then when you add them up, Viola! You’ll have a accurate
estimate for the whole project! Easy peasy.</p><p>There are two
problems with this delusion. First, no task, even a small one,
is easy to estimate. I have seen many “tiny”, one-day tasks blow up
into week long campaigns. All because of hidden complexity that comes
popping out like a Pandora’s box once you start coding on
it.</p><p>Second, when you divide work into little tasks, before
actually working on any of them, you are making untested
assumptions. Many of them. The more tasks you define, the more facets
of a hypothetical design you must assume (implicitly of course, since
no one ever writes design assumptions in task descriptions). Soon,
you’ve created a long chain of design choices, all depending on
previous ones, sitting on sticky notes on the wall.</p><p>The problem
is, as soon as you start working on one of them, you will
realize that your implicit design decisions are wrong. Now, you will spend MUCH more time than was
previously estimated for this task and all other tasks that depend on
its faulty design are invalid. The whole house of cards comes
tumbling down. Time for another all-day backlog grooming session? What
a waste!</p><h3>conclusion</h3><p>Back in the day, before everyone
realized that software companies were positioned to make lots of
money, we had some elbow room. We had a lot of responsibility and the
ability to make a lot of decisions. But now, a lot more people have
piled onto the island. Unfortunately, some of them have slowly chipped
away at the domain of the software engineer. One by one, descending
from their vessels they planted their flags:</p><p>“I am Amerigo, the
product guy. Heretofore, no developer will make product decisions, for
they are mine.”</p><p>“And I am Ferdinand, process guy. Heretofore,
no developer will make process decisions, for they are
mine.”</p><p>“I Bartolomeu will enforce compliance.”</p><p>“I Vasco
used to be pretty good at Microsoft Access, I guess I’ll be the
database guy.”</p><p>One by one, until every responsibility that
wasn’t actual open-up-emacs-and-start-typing-stuff programming was
taken away, forbidden even. And then, the remaining, purely technical
tasks were carved up by architecture/standard hoarding engineers,
hungry for something of substance. Only dry, broken carcasses were
left scattered on the ground.</p><p>Of course, there is a solution to
this predicament — delegate <em>responsibilities</em> to everyone,
all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy. Or better yet,
flatten or abolish the hierarchy all together. But until that
happens, you’ll just have to content yourself with measly for-loops
and if-statements — following the coding standard of
course.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Johnny Galbraith, co-founder of Salt Lake City-based e-commerce company Letterfolk, knew that it was going to be difficult to get orders to customers in a timely manner this holiday season, with more people ordering online than ever before.</p><p>He thought he had come up with a solution: to hold his Black Friday sale a week earlier this year. That way, he would be shipping out his products before carriers like FedEx — which he estimates ships 75% of Letterfolk’s packages — would be under the most strain.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>But on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, Galbraith got a call from his FedEx representative: through the holidays, FedEx would only pick up 110 Letterfolk packages per day — something that has never happened to Galbraith in the five years he’s been in business. It was a number that was calculated based on the average number of packages FedEx was picking up from Letterfolk per day in September, plus 10%. But thanks to his early Black Friday sale, Galbraith had a queue of 3,000 orders waiting to go out.</p>

<p>“It was like, ‘this is going to ruin us as a business,'” said Galbraith, whose company sells letterboards and other home decor. “We are being told that just to ship out our existing queue — without any other orders coming it — it would take us up until the holidays to get them out to customers.”</p>
<p>Carriers like FedEx and UPS have been warning for months to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-holiday-crunch-starts-early-with-more-packages-than-means-to-deliver-them-11603013401">expect holiday shipping delays</a>. But some retail executives, like Galbraith, say they were not given advanced notice by carriers that they could face package pickup limits this holiday. It’s an issue that’s affecting companies both big and small — the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-slaps-shipping-limits-on-gap-nike-to-manage-e-commerce-surge-11606926669">reported</a> last week that UPS had temporarily stopped accepting shipments from major retailers like Nike and Macy’s.</p>
<p>Some executives who spoke with Modern Retail said that they feel like their carriers did not give them enough advance notice before applying a limit, and are frustrated by the fact that limits seem to be arbitrarily applied. In the meantime, they’re scrambling to find often expensive alternatives, including renting their own trucks or trying to find space with other carriers.</p>
<p>Representatives from FedEx and UPS would not provide details to Modern Retail about how they calculate package pickup limits.</p>
<p>FedEx has been “proactively working with our customers to understand their expected volume,” a spokeswoman told Modern Retail, and said the company has been preparing for the holidays by hiring more than 70,000 seasonal workers this year, and for the first time, picking up packages seven days a week.</p>

<p>“<span>UPS</span>&nbsp;continues to work closely with our largest customers to steer volume to capacity and ensure the&nbsp;<span>UPS</span> network is reliable for all customers,” a UPS spokesman said. “Agreed upon strategies for our largest customers include shifting package volume away from the heaviest demand shipping days, fully utilizing weekend capacity, and aligning promotional strategies with capacity.”</p>
<p><strong>Making their own deliveries<br>
</strong>For the most part, UPS and FedEx first started imposing shipping limits after Black Friday. Helena Price Hambrecht, founder of aperitif brand Haus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/business/ecommerce-shipping-holiday-season.html?referringSource=articleShare">told the New York Times</a> that FedEx informed her that starting on Wednesday, its drivers would only pick up 500 packages from Haus per week day, through the holidays. FedEx however, did give Haus a larger cap on the weekends. In a follow-up email to Modern Retail, Price Hambrecht did not say exactly when FedEx informed her of the limit, only that “FedEx has been great about communicating changes to us as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>David Malka, chief sales officer of returns processing company goTRG — which works with major retailers like Target, Walmart and Lowe’s to process some of their returns — told Modern Retail that shipping limits of roughly 200 packages per day had been imposed at four of the company’s warehouses. Though he added that the company is getting “conflicting reports” from FedEx about what exactly the limit is at some facilities. Malka, like Gilbraith said that goTRG received no advanced notice from FedEx that package pickup limits would be applied.</p>
<p>The most immediate way that retailers are trying to deal with pickup limits imposed by UPS or FedEx is to redirect some shipments to another carrier. Shortly after Galbraith’s FedEx representative informed him of Letterfolk’s new limit, he immediately set up deliveries through UPS — something he said he hadn’t done previously because he had a good relationship with FedEx.</p>
<p>That’s helped Letterfolk get through some of the 3,000 order backlog, though its <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/pages/holiday-shipping-info">website is still advising customer</a>s that most orders placed during its Black Friday sale will ship within one to three business weeks. However, he said that it’s more expensive right now for Letterfolk to ship through UPS, because his company didn’t have time to negotiate discounted rates.</p>
<p>Some companies are setting up other contingency plans to ensure their packages get into customers hands more quickly. Price Hambrecht told Modern Retail that Haus will be relying on Ohi, a last-mile delivery provider, to deliver more of its packages in the Bay Area and Southern California.</p>
<p>Jay Sauceda, founder of Austin-based 3PL Sauceda Industries, said that his company rented its own truck for the first time for the holidays. Sauceda — which works with companies including apparel brand Rowing Blazers and bra startup Pepper — has yet to be hit with a package pickup per day limit. But if it does, the plan then is to load packages onto the truck and deliver them directly to a FedEx or UPS sorting facility.</p>
<p>Sauceda is also advising its customers to try and encourage customers to get orders in two to three days ahead of shipping cutoffs given by FedEx, UPS and other carriers to ensure packages arrive in time for Christmas and other key dates.</p>
<p>“[The carriers] are in a very unenviable position,” Sauceda said. “So the biggest thing that we are trying to do this year to try to take the tension off.”</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that FedEx has capped the number of Haus packages it will pick up at 500 per week day, not per day as previously stated.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>
                                Tuesday December 08, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/lars-knoll">Lars Knoll</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>I am really excited to announce today’s release of Qt 6.0. It is the first release of a new major version, and marks a major milestone for Qt. </span><strong><em>We started working on the initial ideas a few years ago, and since then, have put a massive effort into creating the next generation of Qt. </em></strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20email%20launch%20hero%201-png-1.png" alt="Qt 6"></span></a></p>

<p><span>Qt 5 has been a fantastic success over the years, and we have seen an enormous growth of our user base and Qt usage over eight years since we released Qt 5.0. But the world&nbsp; has undergone significant changes since 2012. Qt usage in embedded systems has skyrocketed, C++ has evolved, and new 3D graphics APIs have emerged. These are examples of factors that have directly affected Qt.</span></p>
<p><span>As a cross-platform framework, Qt needs to adjust to those changing requirements. We have managed to adapt very well to many of those requirements during the lifetime of Qt 5. However, maintaining full source and binary compatibility within the Qt 5 series made certain things impossible to fix within its lifetime. With Qt 6, we now have the opportunity to make changes and build Qt to be better suited for the years to come.</span><span></span></p>
<div>
<p>Thus, the mission of Qt 6 is to enable Qt to be the productivity platform for the future. Qt 6.0, as a major release of Qt, gave us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality, and better support today and tomorrow's requirements. Qt 6.0 is a continuation of the Qt 5 series, and we have focused on making migration non-disruptive for users. I published a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener">Qt 6 vision blog post</a> capturing those ideas around 18 months ago.</p>
<p>When creating Qt 6, we ensured that Qt’s core values have been adhered to and upheld, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its cross-platform nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single codebase</li>
<li>Its scalability from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li>Its world-class APIs and tools and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/" rel="noopener">documentation</a>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li>Its maintainability, stability, and compatibility, allowing users to maintain large codebases with minimal effort</li>
<li>Its large developer ecosystem with more than 1.5 million users</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt 6.0 is the first release of the Qt 6 series addressing new market demands while keeping the core values at the heart of what we do.</p>
<p>When developing Qt 6, we had an in-depth look at some of Qt's most central parts to identify how we could improve them. We discovered a couple of core focus areas that we invested considerable time in improving. Those areas include:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging C++17</li>
<li>Next generation QML</li>
<li>New graphics architecture</li>
<li>Unified 2D and 3D for Qt Quick</li>
<li>CMake build system (with qmake still supported for applications)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We have of course also spent time doing numerous improvements in other areas, too many to mention them all here, and I suggest you look at the more detailed <span><span><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_6.0" rel="noopener">wiki page</a>. We are also hosting Meet Qt 6.0 webinar sessions covering the <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607340244" rel="noopener">Americas/EMEIA</a> and <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607339968" rel="noopener">EMEIA/APAC</a> time zones. But let's take a look at some of the highlights.</span></span></p>
</div>
<h3><span>C++17</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png" width="168" alt="C++ 17 in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=84&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 84w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 168w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=252&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 252w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=336&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 336w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=420&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 420w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=504&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 504w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px"></span></p>
<p><span>With Qt 6 we now require a C++17 compatible compiler enabling the use more modern C++ language constructs when developing Qt and also allows for integration points on the API side.</span></p>
<h3><span>Core libraries and APIs</span></h3>
<p><span>Much work has gone into Qt Core, as it is the module that implements the most central parts of Qt. We've gone through many areas there and made improvements. To name some of the most central ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The new <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/property-bindings-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">property and binding system</a>: This system now brings the concept of bindings that made QML such a huge success in Qt 5 available from C++. </span></li>
<li><span>Strings and Unicode: With Qt 5, we started aligning Qt fully with Unicode, where we completed a lot of the work, but a few items remained that we now cleaned up for Qt 6. More details will come in a separate blog post later on.</span></li>
<li><span>QList has been a class that was often criticized in Qt 5, as it was heap allocating objects stored in there that were larger than a pointer, leading to pressure on heap allocation methods. In Qt 6, we changed this and unified QList and QVector into one class. See our <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qlist-changes-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post about QList</a> in Qt 6 for details.</span></li>
<li><span>QMetaType and QVariant are fundamental to how our Qt’s meta-object system works. Signals and slots would not be possible without QMetaType and QVariant is required for dynamic invocations. Those two classes got an almost complete rewrite with Qt 6, and you can read about the details <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/whats-new-in-qmetatype-qvariant" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other parts of Qt that are not related to graphics have also seen large changes. For example, Qt Concurrent has undergone an almost complete rewrite and now makes development of multi-threaded applications more effortless than ever. Qt Network has seen lots of clean-up and improvements. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-network-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post</a> for details.</span></p>
<h3><span>New graphics architecture</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></h3>
<p><span>The graphics architecture of Qt 5 was very much dependent on OpenGL as the underlying 3D graphics API. While this was the right approach in 2012 when we created Qt 5, the market around us has changed significantly over the last couple of years with the introduction of Metal and Vulkan. We now have a large set of different graphics APIs that are commonly being used on different platforms. For Qt as a cross-platform framework, this, of course, meant that we had to adjust to this and ensure our users can run Qt on all of them with </span>maximum performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png" width="367" alt="New graphics architecture in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=184&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 184w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 367w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=551&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 551w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=734&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 734w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=918&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 918w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=1101&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 1101w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px"></p>
<p><span>So while Qt 5 relied on OpenGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, the picture completely changes with Qt 6. All of our 3D graphics in Qt Quick is now built on top of a new abstraction layer for 3D graphics called RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface). RHI makes it possible for Qt to use the native 3D graphics API of the underlying OS/platform. So Qt Quick will now use Direct3D on Windows and Metal on macOS by default. For details, have a look at the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/graphics-in-qt-6.0-qrhi-qt-quick-qt-quick-3d" rel="noopener">blog post series about the RHI</a>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OpenGL specific classes in Qt still exist, but are now moved out of QtGui in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-index.html" rel="noopener">QtOpenGL</a> module. We also added a new module called <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtshadertools-index.html" rel="noopener">QtShaderTools</a> to deal with the different shading languages of those APIs in a cross-platform way.</span></p>
<h3><span>Qt Quick 3D and Qt 3D</span></h3>
<p><span>Qt Quick 3D is a relatively new module. It seamlessly extends Qt Quick with 3D capabilities. With Qt Quick 3D, our focus was to create an API that is as easy to use as the existing parts of Qt Quick (for 2D user interfaces) while providing full support for creating complex 3D scenes. The main goal behind this effort has been to enable seamless integration between 2D and 3D content.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This module has seen significant improvements with Qt 6 that we wouldn’t have been able to do in the Qt 5 series. Most importantly it is now always using the RHI abstraction layer to make optimal use of the underlying graphics API and Hardware. Additionally, it now features a much deeper and more performant integration between 2D and 3D content, allowing you to place 2D items into a 3D scene. It also has vastly improved support for glTF2 and physics-based rendering, making it trivial to import assets created in other design tools. There are many other major improvements in the module, a more in-depth description can be found in a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/what-is-new-in-qt-quick-3d-6.0" rel="noopener">separate blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 3D is now also based on top of the RHI abstraction layer, has seen some performance improvements and cleanups. You can find more details in two blog posts by our partner KDAB (<a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt-3d-changes-in-qt-6/" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt3d-renderer-qt6/" rel="noopener">here</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span>Desktop styling for Qt Quick</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20Desktop%20Styling-png.png" alt="Desktop Styling in Qt 6"></span></p>
<p><span>When we created the set of controls for Qt Quick, our focus was to make them lightweight and performant. For that reason, they did not support desktop styling in Qt 5. However, in Qt 6, we found a way to make them look &amp; feel native on desktop operating systems. With 6.0, Qt Quick now supports native styling on both macOS and Windows. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls" rel="noopener">blog post for details</a>.</span><span> Native look &amp; feel for Android and Linux already existed with the Material and Fusion styles in Qt 5. We are improving those for future Qt releases and are also planning to implement a native style for iOS.</span></p>
<h3><span>Interfacing with platform specific functionality</span></h3>
<p><span>Even with Qt offering most functionality required to develop your application platform-independently, there is sometimes a need to interface with platform-specific functionality. In Qt 5, we provided a set of add-on modules (QtX11Extras, QtWinExtras, QtMacExtras) to help with this purpose. But this full separation from the rest of Qt has led to a couple of architectural issues, inconsistencies and code duplication within Qt. In Qt 6, we made an effort to clean this up and fold the functionality offered by those add-on modules into platform specific APIs offered directly in Qt. This will make interfacing with OS/platform-specific APIs much easier in Qt 6. Have a look <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/platform-apis-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;for more details.</span></p>
<h3><span>Build system and&nbsp;</span><span>Packaging</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png" width="189" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=95&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 95w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 189w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=284&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 284w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=378&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 378w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=473&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 473w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=567&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 567w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></span></p>
<p><span>We also made some considerable changes in how we build and distribute Qt.&nbsp; Worth mentioning is that Qt 6 itself is now <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system" rel="noopener">built using CMake</a>. This has also led to significant improvements for all our users that use CMake to build their projects. We will continue to support qmake for the lifetime of Qt 6, so there is no need to make any changes to your build system if you're using it, but we recommend to use CMake for all new projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6 also comes with a much smaller default package, and many of the add-ons are now distributed as separate packages through a package manager. This gives us more flexibility in adapting release schedules of add-ons to market requirements, allowing, for example, for more frequent feature releases as the core Qt packages or making them available for multiple Qt versions at the same time. In addition, we can use the package manager as a delivery channel for 3rd party content. And finally, it gives our users more flexibility as they can choose to download only what they really need. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, we are using the existing Qt …</span></p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>â€˜Darkâ€™ personalities come in</strong> various shades, but at the core of all of them is a tendency to callously use others for personal gain. What is it that these types of people are really gaining, though? Might a benevolent approach to life and others be even more advantageous?</p>
<p>For <span>15 years,</span> research into dark personality traits (including narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) has been rapidly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">expanding</a>. We now know that these traits are far more <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32484407" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evident</a>, on average, in men than women. We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">approximately</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-13625-018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span>1-2 per cent</span></a> of individuals in the general population display extremely dark personality features â€“ enough to meet the clinical threshold for a personality disorder â€“ and about <span>10-20 per</span> cent of individuals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22996170/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">have</a> moderately elevated levels. We know that even people with moderate levels of dark traits can wreak havoc: they are more likely to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616666070" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">lie and cheat</a>, show <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305468" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">racist</a> attitudes, and be <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-04417-005" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent</a> towards others.</p>
<p>As researchers, we have studied these traits ourselves. But in a bid to balance out the extensive literature on dark traits, we have recently started to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">focus</a> on the light side of human personality instead â€“ the â€˜everyday saintsâ€™ among us. These people are genuinely interested in others and treat them well without question, not as a means to an end. They applaud the success of others, believe in the fundamental goodness of humans, and respect the dignity of everyone. Our recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692030310X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 36,000 adults suggests that these traits are common: around <span>30-50 per cent</span> of people show prominent light personality trait profiles, depending on world region, and these traits are particularly common in women.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand which personality profile â€“ dark or light â€“ leads to more success and happiness in the long run. There is an oft-touted saying that â€˜Nice guys finish lastâ€™ and, on the face of it, this might seem correct. If youâ€™re always expending your energy caring about others, perhaps youâ€™re bound to get left behind. If youâ€™re willing to deceive and exploit others without worrying about their feelings, you can look after â€˜number oneâ€™ and rise faster to the top. But does the research back this up?</p>
<p>Experimental studies support the idea of a â€˜successfulâ€™ dark personality, but only up to a point. One <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-11168-026" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that people with psychopathic personality traits win more points on a negotiation task where they are required to compete with a partner, but fewer points on a task that involves cooperation. Those with dark traits are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-018-9823-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">more</a> likely to â€˜defectâ€™ in the classic Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma task â€“ an approach that means maximising your own outcome while duping the other participant.</p>
<p>But their success in the real world is questionable. In corporate settings, those with dark personality traits are slightly more likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51219-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emerge</a> as leaders and are seen as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.925" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">charismatic</a> but, when it comes to getting the job done, they tend to achieve less and are considered poor team players. Our recent study also found that political figures with dark personality traits are more likely to get elected and hold their positions, but other studies <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615611922" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">show</a> that they are much poorer at getting legislation passed. Hedge fund managers with these traits generally <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217733080" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">obtain</a> significantly lower financial returns on the investment funds they manage. Overall, individuals with dark traits <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0025679" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">engage</a> in more counterproductive work behaviour, such as theft and abusive supervision. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they donâ€™t end up with higher average incomes than their peers with light personalities.</p>
<p>Through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on</p>
<p>On top of this, those with dark personality traits donâ€™t have much luck outside of work. Even if they manage to avoid prison (imprisonment being a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18837606/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">high</a> possibility for those with extreme traits), they are at increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suicide</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556964/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent death</a>. They are also not particularly happy: people with dark traits tend to report poor self-image, an inability to intimately connect with others, and little life satisfaction. In contrast, we found that those with light personality trait profiles have fulfilling, intrinsically rewarding lives: they generally have a more positive view of themselves, more positive connections with others and find life more satisfying.</p>
<p>The key factor here seems to be empathy: the capacity to resonate with â€“ and understand the perspective of â€“ the emotional experiences of others. Individuals with light personality traits show a great deal of empathy for others, while those with dark personality traits tend to show very little. In our new research, we found that this seems to be what leads to a more satisfying life. Similarly, being prosocial â€“ acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others â€“ is also significantly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-65092-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> with higher wellbeing.</p>
<p>As a species, weâ€™re fundamentally built for social connectedness, and we depend on cooperation and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.14.3.137" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">trust</a>. When those with dark personalities try to take advantage of this for their own personal gain, they do so at their own peril. In essence, through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on. While those with dark traits might initially capture the attention of others, their social behaviour ultimately leads to limited success in work or politics, and little satisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>So far, we have</strong> made it seem as though people fall into one of two binary groups: dark or light. But in reality, thereâ€™s a third group: we found that about <span>40 per cent</span> of individuals show a balance of dark and light traits. People in this mixed group are similar to the light group when it comes to critical variables involving empathy and social connectedness, but they still show some dark tendencies â€“ hampering their relationships to some degree with deceitful, self-absorbed or hurtful behaviour toward others.</p>
<p>Some might think that the mixed group is the optimal place to be: youâ€™re able to have some connection with others, but wonâ€™t be taken as a pushover. But compared with those with a light personality, mixed individuals have lower levels of life satisfaction and a less positive self-image. It seems that the mixed group are on the way to the light personality profile, so to speak, but fall short of the full expression â€“ and the added dark traits are whatâ€™s holding them back.</p>
<p>As people age â€“ particularly from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles</p>
<p>Regardless of where you fall on these dimensions of personality, we <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">believe</a> in the fundamental ability to grow and change. Large-scale studies have <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0024950" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">documented</a> that your general personality (eg, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness) continues to change throughout your lifetime, and weâ€™ve found the same to be true when it comes to light and dark traits.</p>
<p>Specifically, we found that the extent to which you exhibit light or dark personality traits tends to shift as you get older. As people age â€“ particularly as they progress from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles. Other <a href="https://content.apa.org/record/2014-34008-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that moral character traits, such as conscientiousness and self-control, are generally more common in older people. Age doesnâ€™t completely account for the results â€“ younger people can display light personality traits â€“ but the research suggests that what can fundamentally differentiate light and dark profiles is a process of psychological maturation.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417734875" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">born</a> with an innate sense of fairness, though this is a limited ability. Thus, like language, it is a skill that requires further development. Our research, and studies of our closest relatives, nonhuman primates, both show that moral behaviour can emerge and change across development â€“ in large part through cooperative social interactions. Thus, by embracing and trusting social connections, we can progress toward a light personality trait profile â€“ a pathway that appears to lead to healthy self-actualisation and even transcendence.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re curious about where you fall on the light vs dark personality spectrum, you can answer the <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">questions</a> we used in our study. We have now tested more than 250,000 individuals from across the globe, and you can see how your responses compare with the average. And remember, there is always scope for change: we believe in the fundamental ability to grow and transcend self-centredness through deliberate and sustained changes in our patterns of behaviour and thinking.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to <em>want</em> to change. Unfortunately, most people with extreme levels of dark personality traits donâ€™t want to change who they are. Despite not being particularly happy with their lives, they remain fixated on what they think they need: more and more power, wealth and domination over others.</p>
<p>Of course, some days weâ€™re all motivated to shut out other people, and simply look out for ourselves. This can be especially true when it seems that those who cheat, deceive and take advantage of others are somehow getting ahead. But rest assured that this doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. We have found that being empathic and connected to others â€“ capitalising on our fundamentally social nature â€“ is ultimately the pathway to a more rewarding life.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <section>  <section> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction"></a></h2>  <p>I’m Sebastian McKenzie, the creator of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>
