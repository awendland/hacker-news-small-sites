<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Be a creator, not just a consumer<br></h2><p>I sit down every weekend to write. It’s a routine I’ve deliberately cultivated for myself during this year as a way to get out of my own head and put my thoughts on (metaphorical) paper. </p><p>It started with this post on cultivating a <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/daily-writing-habit" target="_blank">daily writing habit</a>, which I moved away from after <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/writing-25-blog-posts-in-25-days" target="_blank">25 days</a> into a weekly schedule.</p><p>Some of my writings go out as tweet threads, others as blog posts on this site. Invariably, I am creating and publishing week after week.</p><p>It's not just to achieve end goal (follow systems, not goals) that I write every week. I thoroughly enjoy the process of creation, the act of sitting with lo-fi or synthwave tunes in the background and punching away at the keyboard brain dumping onto a notepad.</p><p>I’ve managed to get <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/all-posts" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> (my co-founder) onto writing as well. He’s still working out a schedule that helps him create and publish good content consistently, but he’s started walking the treadmill which is the important part.</p><p>Recently I’ve been engaging with my team at DelightChat to get into a regular publishing routine. <a href="https://www.akashj.com/" target="_blank">Akash</a> already writes occasionally, Deb published his podcast on <a href="https://saascontentatscale.com/" target="_blank">SaaS content marketing</a>, and Niraj is setting up his blog as we speak.</p><p>However, I didn’t want to be some old fart, a preacher who is saying “get on the horse” without explaining the why.</p><p>So here goes.<br></p><h2>Reasons to write</h2><p>Before proceeding further, I must make one thing clear. While I personally prefer writing, the message here is to create stuff. </p><p>Create art, design album covers, shoot vlogs, record podcasts, write code. The focus is on creation, and becoming a creator in a world where most people are only consuming.</p><p>Here’s how I explained the importance of writing and being a creator to my team.</p><p>The whole world and everything in it, people and entities, are connected by invisible strings. You can visualise it like a web, an interconnected web with billions of points. </p><p>Yes, I’m describing the model of the internet. Yes it’s more relevant than ever, because until recently majority of the world wasn’t online and connected to each other. With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank">4.57 billion</a> people on the internet, we are literally living in the interconnected web. And hence it’s important for you to visualise and grasp the enormity of it.</p><p>Back to reasons.</p><p>You can take this giant web of interconnected beings and entities, and splice it in any direction you want. And you always end up with a subset of people. </p><figure id="w-node-5239bfbcbdf9-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f817d2c1f8d6ba3787fa59e_node%20network%20map%20of%20the%20internet.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>A map of the internet. Which cross-section will you splice?</em></figcaption></figure><p>Example of a large splice - people who enjoy listening to music.</p><p>Example of a smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock music.</p><p>Even smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock and compose tracks and sing in a band in the same genre.</p><p>You can take this concept and apply it to any idea and pull at the strings.</p><p>With this blog post, I’m pulling at the strings that connect people who want to create stuff, have the ability to create stuff, and want to get started but haven’t yet. More specifically, my blog might appeal to people who have the ability and desire to write.</p><p>Anyway, now you have identified a splice or subset. What next?</p><p>The question really becomes, how do you make yourself a valuable entity in a given subset or splice of this giant interconnected web? How do you become a valuable node.</p><p>And there’s only one answer to it.</p><p>The only way to become a valuable node is by pushing/publishing/releasing value into the web. But like an ocean, a drop won’t be noticed by anybody. You need a pond where you can make a splash. </p><p>You need to narrow down and focus on a small enough splice, such that when you tug at its strings, you have a real chance to get noticed. That way the value that you create in the form of written, video, audio, code, etc about topics that your narrow splice of the web cares about has a chance of earning their attention.</p><p>There is no other way. It’s not going to be easy. Many others are trying to grab the same splice of attention. </p><p>But, life is not a zero sum game. </p><p>Multiple people can win. You can win too.</p><p>And that’s brings me to the #1 reason to write or create stuff.</p><p><strong>You can’t win if you don’t participate.</strong><br></p><h2>Common obstacles to writing</h2><p>From my conversations with people, I’ve found the most common obstacles to be</p><ol role="list"><li>You don’t know why to write or create stuff</li><li>You don’t know what to write about</li><li>You don’t have a schedule or consistency</li><li>Procrastination (the human mind is marvelous)</li></ol><p>I’ve already solved the first problem by explaining the why. <br></p><h3>Create a consistent writing schedule</h3><p>The third problem can be solved by committing to a schedule. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/scale" target="_blank">James Clear</a> published on Mondays and Thursdays for three years until his blog finally took off. The rest we already know about. </p><p>I committed to a daily writing schedule at first, which was hard but it helped me get out of my rut. This commitment was made in public and to my girlfriend in person. </p><p>The two factors combined pushed me enough to get over my mental barriers and keep writing daily, especially on days I didn’t feel like. Back then I was writing shorter posts, which I’ve traded for longer thought pieces once a week.</p><p>You too can set a simple but achievable routine. </p><p>Set a reminder on Fridays to think of a topic to create about, spend a few hours on Saturday punching the keyboard furiously until you’ve dumped all your thoughts on paper, and then edit it before hitting publish on Sunday. </p><p>The DelightChat team has a recurring event on the calendar to help maintain a consistent creator schedule.</p><figure id="w-node-1e110a69cf8d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f81679d2365946712414656_consistent%20writing%20schedule%20write%20weekly.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Remember to set a target that’s easy enough to achieve. You’re not aiming for the pulitzer prize, you are trying to create a habit that’s super easy to do, thereby reducing chances of failure.</p><h3>Overcome writing procrastination</h3><p>Here are a few common procrastination arrows your brain is going to shoot at you. I’m going to make you aware of them so you can dodge them. <br></p><p><strong>“I don’t have time to write.”</strong></p><p>Create a schedule, commit to it, tell your friends, family or someone who will ask you and therefore hold you accountable.<br></p><p><strong>“I don’t know what to write about.”</strong></p><p>I’ve answered that in the next section.<br></p><p><strong>“Ding! New notification from WhatsApp.”</strong></p><p>Pour oil on your phone, throw it in the dustbin, and light it on fire.</p><p>Or, you could put it on silent and place it exactly behind your laptop screen (out of eyesight). Has served me well.</p><p><strong>"I don't have something interesting to say. I only want to write if I have something unique to say."</strong></p><p>You are a unique person with a unique perspective and thoughts about life due to your unique circumstances and upbringing and the hundreds and thousands of experiences you've had up until now.</p><p>You have something unique to say. The topic might be old (it always is), but your unique perspective, your anecdotal experience, all add up.<br></p><p><strong>“But I need to setup my blog, set up markdown, and more.”</strong></p><p>No, you need to write. Writing is the goal, not integrating markdown.<br></p><p><strong>“But the text editor I use isn’t friendly. It doesn’t integrate with my blog.”</strong></p><p>Google Keep or Apple Notes works perfectly and is very distraction free. </p><p>Blow up the font size until you can’t see anything else on the screen. It’s what I do and it works.</p><p>Your real challenge, and the only one that matters is sitting down and penning your thoughts, or creating stuff. You can do it on a piece of paper (but do it on Google Keep or Apple Notes, seriously).<br></p><p><strong>“But should I publish on Medium, on Substack, how do I format it into a tweet thread, etc.”</strong></p><p>The medium can come later. The medium is a constraint. </p><p>Constraints can be walked around of using creativity. But it's not a limiting factor by any means. </p><p><strong>Your goal is to write or create.</strong><br></p><p>There is no perfect moment, the right time to start, or a sign from the universe where you suddenly kick procrastination in the face and get started. There is only the here and now.</p><figure id="w-node-3259c2c4fa4e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8275f05451d7829eeee560_beat%20procrastination%20there%20is%20no%20sign%20from%20the%20universe.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href="https://unsplash.com/@austinchan" target="_blank"><em>Austin Chan</em></a><em> </em></figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully these prompts I've written will help you dodge your brain’s procrastination bullets.<br></p><h2>What to write about</h2><p>Throughout the week I gather ideas on what to write about </p><ul role="list"><li>from conversations with my co-founder, team and other people, </li><li>by observing what others have written about and if I have a perspective to share, </li><li>thoughts circling in my head, </li></ul><p>and so on..</p><p>There’s infinite sources for gathering ideas, but it’s important to have an eye for catching ideas (similar to how one can train themselves to spot business or startup ideas). </p><p>And it's equally important to jot down those ideas somewhere safe and easy to access.</p><p>I have a private WhatsApp group to drop ideas whenever I have them.</p><figure id="w-node-3fbdec9be5eb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8166d013df6c908d268c79_writing%20ideas%20store%20in%20whatsapp%20group.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Sankalp was facing a problem with coming up with topics to write about.

<![CDATA[Creating a Slack app that uses fewer resources]]>

  <p>
  I recently created a macOS app called Slack Lite, which beats Slack's desktop app across a few performance metrics.
  Slack Lite uses Slack's official UI, so it's visually indistinguishable from the official client.
  Even so, Slack Lite uses 5x fewer threads, 3.5x less time to startup, and significantly less CPU.
  In the Activity Monitor screenshots below, you can see the raw numbers (Slack Lite's processes are highlighted):
</p>

Slack Helper (Renderer), CPU %: 0.9, Threads: 15.

Slack Helper, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 9.
Slack Helper (GPU), CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 8.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 5.

<img src="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/memory.png" alt="
Table from Activity Monitor's Memory tab:
Highlighted: https://app.slack.com, Memory: 262.4 MB.
Slack Helper (Renderer), Memory: 95.4 MB.
Slack, Memory: 62.8 MB.
Slack Helper (GPU), Memory: 49.7 MB.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, Memory: 24.1 MB.
Slack Helper, Memory: 12.4 MB.
">

<blockquote>
    Edit: this post previously claimed that Slack Lite used 1.2x less memory, but the numbers in the screenshots do not support that claim.
    I retook the screenshots between drafts of this post, and I suspect that's how I introduced that error.
    In practice, the memory difference is negligible.
  </blockquote>


<p>
  It's time to come clean: the performance differences described in this post are not really inherent to Slack Lite.
  I suspect you could get similar numbers by applying this Slack Lite approach to any Electron-based macOS app.
  Slack Lite is a <a href="https://github.com/kofigumbs/multi">Multi</a> app, which means it's using a WebKit WebView behind the scenes.
  Ultimately, the numbers above are a proxy for the Chrome vs. Safari comparison.
</p>

<p>
  I'm neither a performance engineer nor a desktop application engineer, but the Slack Lite approach just <em>feels right</em> to me.
  If I already have a browser engine built into my operating system, why should application developers ship a different one for use with their "native" app?
  Especially if that application is a minimal wrapper for an existing web application.
  I know that the answer circles around developer productivity, but to me the "state of the art" still feels off.
  I also know that other folks are thinking about this tension!
  Here's a neat demo from Twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/nateparrott/status/1275829708354211840" rel="external">@nateparrott</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Here's another experiment we built at <a href="https://twitter.com/browsercompany" rel="external">@browsercompany</a>: "Launcher." Half the apps I use are web apps, and half are macOS apps. What if they behaved the same? (1/5)
    <video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/EbSmCcZWAAES5EK.mp4" autoplay="" muted="" controls="" loop="" alt="Screen recording of a macOS app called Launcher. It appears to work much like Spotlight or Alfred, except that once an item is \" launched\",="" it="" becomes="" a="" full="" macos="" app="" with="" new="" window="" and="" dockbar="" entry."="">
    </video>
  </blockquote>


<p>
  Perhaps the most exciting part of this experiment is that I created the Slack Lite in <a href="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/demo.mp4">30 seconds</a>.
  As I mentioned above, Slack Lite is a Multi app.
  I built Multi specifically for this use case: quickly creating a lightweight macOS app from any group of websites.
  If that approach <em>feels right</em> to you as well, I hope you take a moment to try out Multi, which is open-source and available on GitHub:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>A few days ago I had an idea for a silly skit that I would post on TikTok. I spent about 5-10 minutes filming it with no script or plan and posted it on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shmemmmy/video/6880323857903799558?source=h5_m">my TikTok</a> and my <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1313303791186268160?s=20">Twitter</a>. I went to bed and in the morning was awoken to messages from my friends and acquaintances that I was suddenly on the front page of Reddit.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0dpllvD.png" alt="My video on the front page of reddit" width="400px">
</p>

<p>I was excited about going viral and initially happy that people were liking my silly little video, but of course, as a woman with her face and body suddenly in front of millions of people, that faded quickly.</p>

<p>The video was shared on a programming humor subreddit (without attribution I might add), but my annoyance and fear wasn’t in the missed clout or internet points, but it was that I lost control of being able to delete the post, delete comments, or block commenters when it was posted on a new platform.</p>

<p>Here’s just a small example of the comments that started streaming in</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pYyqNRq.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BsaeIjB.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BOXJoSG.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
</p>

<p>And how did this impact me personally? While the video was going viral, I felt like prey and couldn’t focus. I knew people were watching, judging, possibly trying to find me elsewhere on the internet to harass me in real-time. I started getting notifications people were trying to log in to my internet accounts. I locked everything down with 2FA (which I should have had anyway). My past experiences have primed me to expect the worse and feel foolish to hope for the best.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-next">What happened next:</h3>

<p>I reported all of the terrible comments (as did friends) but ~24 hours later, almost none of them had been removed. I reached out to the moderators of the subreddit with an appeal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is my first time being posted on Reddit, and I’m a bit disappointed by the moderation here. There are clearly disgusting sexual comments directed at me and unrelated to the video content or programming humor ranging from the stupid (“boobs”) to the more troublesome - including people directing people to go to my social media to get a better look at my body parts and violent imagery about me. All of these comments I have been reporting over the past 24 hours and very few of them have been removed.</p>

  <p>I would hope you can be more vigilant about moderating these types of comments because it does not create a very welcoming environment for women in tech. The sub isn’t SexistProgrammerHumor and I am personally seeing and reading these sexualized comments about my body (as are thousands of other people including my friends, partner, acquaintances, and coworkers).</p>

  <p>I would urge you to please add a new sub rule about these types of comments if you are interested in being a more welcoming place where I would feel comfortable posting my content. Also if a woman is the subject of a viral post, these types of comments and behavior should be expected and nipped in the bud as unacceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t expecting much but the next day I received a response which was basically the best I could have hoped for. I do appreciate the response, and here’s to hoping this doesn’t happen on this sub again, but of course there are thousands of other subs/communities online and other women posting content still out there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First I’d like to apologize for what happened here, this is seriously unacceptable and we really screwed up moderating this as the tread should’ve been locked way earlier. I’ve removed most if not all of the offending comments and the most egregious offenders have been permanently banned.</p>

  <p>We’re definitely going to adjust our rules to ban sexualized comments of any kind, since again any behaviour like this is unacceptable and I’m sorry we didn’t have clearer rules for this earlier.</p>

  <p>We’re also going to look into enlisting more mods, to help us better manage situations like this.</p>

  <p>We’re here to help in any way we can, so please don’t hesitate to write back if anything else is going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure some of you have thoughts about this and I will try to address them.</p>

<h3 id="but-content-creators-should-expect-some-level-of-criticism-on-the-internet">“But content creators should expect some level of criticism on the internet”</h3>

<p>Yes, you are correct. And there were some actual “criticisms” posted that I was able to brush off easily. One example: “You can see her hand move when she is starting/pausing the filming”. And you’re right! My video editing skills for a silly TikTok I didn’t know was going to go viral were sub-par and this is a valid criticism.</p>

<p>But there’s a huge difference between a critique of the filming process and threads discussing me personally - everything about how annoying my voice is to debating my breast size (and directing people to go look at my social media to settle the debate). Whether you think these constitute valid criticisms or not, I think we can agree it will make people feel unsafe.</p>

<p>I didn’t post the video on Reddit myself for this exact reason. I find it to be a pretty toxic place for women and POC. There are places on Reddit where this commentary is allowed and even encouraged (see all the NSFW and controversial subreddits), but a programming humor subreddit allowing this is just continuing the trend of making women feel unwelcome in this industry.</p>



<p>While at first, it seems like a solid idea to ignore the haters, so to speak, first of all, if no one is reading the worst comments, we’re not reporting these things so nothing will ever change. Secondly, a discussion that starts as mild can escalate to doxxing, organized dogpiling, or threats. Not knowing that this is happening could be dangerous.  </p>

<h3 id="these-people-are-just-incels-and-the-scum-of-the-internet">“These people are just incels and the scum of the internet”</h3>

<p>When I was in college there were 2 anonymous message boards (YikYak and ACB) where students would post terribly racist and sexist things in addition to harassing individual girls at the school (not me because I wasn’t popular). It’s especially alarming to me that this was at an Ivy League school where most of these kids were raised “well” and would continue to go on to start companies, go to the best graduate programs, and be the “future leaders” of our world. And I’m sure most of these kids would have NEVER said any of those things in person, but being anonymous gives you a strange power and a weird desire to say harmful things.</p>

<p>I think people rush to dismiss these trolls as “the scum of the internet incels”, but I think that this is wrong. I think it’s way closer to home than that. I think they are Ivy League grads, fellow software engineers in SF, and people I ride the subway with. Normal people who really live normal lives in real life, but take out some internal rage online under the veil of anonymity.</p>

<p>Further, I think dismissing them as lost causes or “just trolls” minimizes the problem and gives an excuse for their behavior.</p>

<h3 id="i-know-what-some-of-you-are-still-thinking-i-agree-that-its-bad-but-when-you-put-yourself-out-there-on-the-internet-this-should-be-expected">I know what some of you are still thinking. “I agree that it’s bad, but when you put yourself out there on the internet, this should be expected”</h3>

<p>I think this is bullshit. Why should a woman have to expect to be harassed every time she puts herself out there online?</p>

<p>If somehow, you’ve made it this far as someone who has posted a nasty comment under the safety of anonymity before, I urge you to consider your words and how you are contributing to unsafe communities.</p>

<p>Platforms and their moderators can stop turning a blind eye to this type of behavior. It’s time to spend some resources, set clear rules, and enforce them. Your bottom line won’t matter if more than half of the human race feels unsafe on your platform.</p>

<p>I think we can all do better. We can call out and report this behavior as unacceptable when we see it. We can ask for and expect our communities to be held to a higher standard. I call on all of you to see and report these things. While it is not ideal that the onus is on us to take action, if we see it and don’t report it, nothing will ever change.</p>

<p>Maybe one day a woman will be able to post a silly video on the internet without fear.</p>

But it may surprise consumers to learn what can actually happen to all those unwanted items.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A <em>Marketplace</em> investigation into Amazon Canada has found that perfectly good items are being liquidated by the truckload&nbsp;— and even destroyed or sent to landfill. Experts say hundreds of thousands of returns don't end up back on the e-commerce giant's website for resale, as customers might think. &nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> journalists posing as potential new clients went undercover for a tour at a Toronto e-waste recycling and product destruction facility with hidden cameras. During that meeting, a representative revealed they get "tons and tons of Amazon returns," and that every week their facility breaks&nbsp;apart and shreds&nbsp;at least one tractor-trailer load of Amazon returns, sometimes even up to three to five truckloads. &nbsp;</p>  <p>"We're not the only ones. We couldn't handle all of Amazon. There's no way. It is so — it's like cockroaches, it multiplies. It's incredible," said the operations manager. &nbsp;</p>  <p>CBC News is concealing her identity because both this company and others that help Amazon dispose of or resell its online returns are afraid they'll lose their contracts if they speak publicly. &nbsp;</p>  <p>"Some of it will go into landfill," said the operations manager.

The trackers became a guide into the secretive world of e-commerce returns.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Many returns took a circuitous route, often covering several hundreds — sometimes even thousands — of kilometres to reach their final destination. <em>Marketplace</em> returned toy blocks that travelled over 950 kilometres before reaching a new customer in Quebec. And a printer clocked over 1,000 kilometres while circling around southern Ontario.</p>  <p>Of the 12 items returned, it appears only four were resold by Amazon to new customers at the time this story was published.

	<p><small>September 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently in the Fediverse, I read <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104927850229553836">this toot</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you know that #Unix groups have passwords? Apparently if you set
one, you then have to use newgrp to log in to that group.</p>

<p>I have never seen anyone use unix group passwords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Via <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye">@mhoye</a>.)</p>

<p>There are some things to say about this, but the first thing you
might wonder is why the <code>newgrp</code> command exists at all. The best
answer is that it's mostly a Unix historical relic (or, to put it
another way, a fossil).</p>

<p>In basically all current Unixes, processes can be in multiple groups
at once, often a lot of them. However this is a feature added in
BSD; it wasn't the case in the original Research Unixes, including
V7, and for a long time it wasn't the case in System V either. In
those Unixes, you could be listed as a member of various groups in
<code>/etc/groups</code>, but a given process was only in one group at a time.
The <code>newgrp</code> command was how you switched back and forth between
groups.</p>

<p>In general, <code>newgrp</code> worked in the way you'd expect, given Unix.  It was
a setuid root program that switched itself into the new group and then
<code>exec</code>'d into your shell (after carefully dropping its setuid powers).</p>

<p>(The actual behavior of <code>newgrp</code> in V7 is an interesting topic,
but that's for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NewgrpV7Behavior">another entry</a>.)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/">tuhs.org</a>, a
<code>newgrp</code> command appears in Research Unix V6, but it doesn't seem
to be in V5. You could have written one, though, as there was a
<code>setgid()</code> system call at least as far back as V4 (and V4 may be
where the idea of groups was invented). Somewhat to my surprise,
the existence of group passwords also dates back to V6 Unix.</p>

<p>(Before I started looking into this, I would have guessed that group
passwords were added somewhere in the System III/System V line of AT&amp;T
Unix, as AT&amp;T adopted it to 'production' usage.)</p>

<p>PS: I'm pleased to see that OpenBSD seems to have dropped the <code>newgrp</code>
command at some point. Linux and FreeBSD both continue to have it, and I
can't imagine that Illumos, Solaris, or any other surviving commercial
Unixes have gotten rid of it either.</p>

<p>Making code run fast on GPUs requires a very different approach to making code run fast on CPUs because the hardware architecture is fundamentally different. If you come from a background of efficient coding on CPU then you’ll have to adjust some assumptions about what patterns are best.</p>
<p>Machine learning engineers of all kinds should care about squeezing performance from their models and hardware — not just for production purposes, but also for research and training. In research as in development, a fast iteration loop leads to faster improvement.</p>
<p>This article is a practical deep dive into making a specific deep learning model (<a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">Nvidia’s SSD300</a>) run fast on a powerful GPU server, but the general principles apply to all GPU programming. The SSD300 is an object-detection model trained on COCO, so output will be bounding boxes with probabilities for 81 classes of object.</p>

  How Far Can We Push a Python-based Inference Pipeline?

</h3>
<p>Part of the point of this article is to see what throughput we can get without leaving behind the flexibility of Python or the familiarity of the library the model was created with (Pytorch). We will not go super deep into custom CUDA kernels or use a standard “serving” framework because we will find many large optimizations available at a high level. We’ll start from a naively implemented simple video inference pipeline, following on from my introductory <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pytorch_pipeline/">Pytorch Video Pipeline</a> article.</p>
<p>Sample code is here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/pytorch-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/pytorch-video-pipeline</a>.</p>

<p>The baseline version of the code will use the postprocessing functions in the <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300</a> repo as per the <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">PyTorch Hub page</a>. The implementers of this model do not pretend this sample code is production ready and we will find many ways to improve it. In fact, the published <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD#inference-performance-results">benchmarking results</a> for this model do not run the postprocessing code at all.</p>
<p>Top-level per-frame processing logic looks like this:</p>

<p>The important parts are highlighted above:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>buffer_to_image_tensor</code> converts Gstreamer buffers (decoded from video frames) into Pytorch tensors.</li>
<li><code>preprocess</code> turns the 0 to 255 integral RGB pixel values into scaled -1.0 to +1.0 float values.</li>
<li><code>detector(image_batch)</code> runs the SSD300 model, and it’s important to note that the model and input tensor are on a CUDA device (GPU) at this point.</li>
<li><code>postprocess</code> turns model output into bounding boxes and scores for each class label.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will dig into these functions later, for now let’s examine baseline performance.</p>
<h3 id="tracing-with-nvidia-nsight-systems">
  Tracing with Nvidia Nsight Systems
  <a href="#tracing-with-nvidia-nsight-systems">#</a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nsight Systems</a> is a great tool to help with high-level GPU tuning. It shows CPU/GPU resource utilization, and is able to trace OS system calls, CUDA, CuDNN, CuBLAS, NVTX and even some technologies we don’t care about.</p>
<p>NVTX is an important API we’ll use for instrumenting regions and events in our code — this will be allow us to map traced utilization patterns to logic in the code.</p>
<p>Having run the baseline video pipeline with tracing enabled, opening Nsight Systems shows around 40 seconds of activity decoding and processing the video file (click for full resolution):</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pipeline_tuning/images/tuning_baseline_high_level.png">

        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>

</a>

<p>As you can see, there is plenty of information. Nsight Systems shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource utilization over time aggregated by hardware device (different CPUs and GPUs).</li>
<li>Resource utilization over time aggregated into processes and threads.</li>
<li>Call duration for numerous toolkits, including OS calls and the custom NVTX ranges I’ve put in our code. These will become clear as we zoom in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve added annotations for some problems that are clear even at this very high level. CPU usage is high, GPU usage is low, and there are a lot of memory transfers between host (system memory) and device (GPU memory).</p>
<p>Let’s drill in to show processing for a couple of frames. Note the NTVX ranges in grey corresponding to logical parts of the code:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pipeline_tuning/images/tuning_baseline_two_frames.png">

        <img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pipeline_tuning/images/tuning_baseline_two_frames_hu7ea67ed14e6f682d2580cb4b03ba3b9b_461248_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520">
        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Postprocessing taking &gt;90% of elapsed time is a disaster — from a high-level this is the first thing to fix, but what is causing it?</p>
<p>During postprocessing we can see that CPU usage is very high, GPU usage is very low (but not 0%), and there are constant memory transfers from device to host. The most likely scenario is that the postprocessing is largely being done on CPU, but it is constantly pulling small pieces of data from the GPU required for the processing.</p>
<p>Let’s drill in to show activity for a couple of milliseconds:</p>

        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the CUDA API timeline, we can see a lot of memory transfers and the green synchronization around them. The CUDA synchronization calls are further evidence that this postprocessing is being done partly on CPU and partly on GPU and is synchronized in a very fine-grained fashion. Let’s fix it.</p>
<p>Here is the baseline postprocessing code:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>At the point of the highlighted line, the arguments <code>locs</code> and <code>labels</code> are tensors on the GPU (these are returned directly from the SSD300 inference). The <code>decode_results</code> code is accessing the tensors elementwise and doing work on CPU, causing the repeated fine-grained requests for data to be sent from GPU to system memory.</p>
<p>The initial fix is super simple — we will send these entire tensors to system memory in a single operation.</p>

<p>Running the baseline code without tracing enabled gave us 9 FPS throughput and this improved code runs at just under 16 FPS. A 78% improvement is not bad for just typing <code>.cpu()</code> twice. This leads to a good rule of thumb for GPU programming:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Avoid Fine-Grained Synchronization</strong></p>
<p>Your host (CPU) code is dispatching work to an incredibly powerful co-processor which can do complex work asynchronously. However, host/device communication latency and synchronization are costly — try to dispatch large chunks of work and avoid fine-grained memory transfers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The updated Nsight Systems view showing processing for two frames (below) has a clear difference. Instead of a constant stream of small transfers from device to host we now see one large transfer at the start of the postprocessing phase.</p>

<p>Postprocessing still takes over 80% of frame-processing time and the process is still heavily CPU bottlenecked. What if we could do the postprocessing using the GPU?</p>

<p>Turning preprocessing and postprocessing into heavily vectorized GPU code can be tricky for some models but is one of the highest-impact performance improvements you can make.</p>

<p><em>Cloud native storage tool has grown its contributor base by 260% since joining CNCF&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – October 7, 2020 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Rook. To move from the maturity level of <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">incubation to graduation</a> Rook has demonstrated growing adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p>



<p>Rook is an open source cloud native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud native environments. Rook delivers its services via a Kubernetes Operator for each storage provider. It was originally accepted as a CNCF project in 2018. It is the thirteenth CNCF project, and the first project based on block, file, or object storage, to graduate.</p>



<p>“Storage is an important aspect of any cloud native deployment, and Rook fills a gap for teams who historically ran persistent storage outside of cloud native environments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO/COO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Rook is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes through the operator paradigm, we are excited to see the project graduate and look forward to cultivating their growing community.”</p>



<p>Since joining CNCF, user adoptions, the community ecosystem, and project maturity have been steadily growing and improving. Rook is being used in production by several companies, including Calit2 UCSD, Finleap Connect, Geodata, and many <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">others</a>.</p>



<p>The maintainer team currently consists of <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/OWNERS.md">7 members</a>, with a healthy distribution of organizations including Cloudical, Nexenta, Red Hat, Suse, and Upbound. Since becoming an incubating project in September 2018, contributors to the core Rook repository have grown by 260% from 90 to 279. Over the last 12 months, 184 <a href="https://rook.devstats.cncf.io/d/22/prs-authors-table?orgId=1&amp;var-period_name=Last%20year&amp;var-repogroup_name=All">distinct contributors</a> have authored more than 1,140 pull requests.</p>



<p>“Rook was born from the need for automated storage management in cloud native environments. Rather than plugging external storage solutions into Kubernetes, we recognized that a storage platform was needed within a Kubernetes cluster,” said Travis Nielsen, Rook maintainer and senior principal software engineer at Red Hat. “We are very proud of this graduation that recognizes the maturity of the project and our dedication to quality, security, and reliability in production!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In 2018, when we donated Rook to CNCF, there was strong interest and community around Kubernetes and a need for automated storage management for the cloud native community. It was important to make sure that Rook remained free and community-driven to continue to drive innovation for the broader ecosystem,” said Jared Watts, co-founder of Rook and founding engineer at Upbound. “We’re proud of Rook’s thriving community, thanks to CNCF leadership and support, and look forward to pushing the ecosystem forward as a mature, production-ready cloud native storage solution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOwrwYmBUpLUm6W5J5rhXvdVit818hWJ/view?usp=sharing">security audit</a> was performed by the CNCF Security SIG in December 2019, which resulted in 13 findings ranging from High to Low in severity, many of them common amongst open source projects. The Rook maintainers have taken steps to address these issues. The Security SIG reviewed the project and recommended to the TOC that the project should graduate with no substantive concerns regarding its architecture or health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We never lost a byte of data even though upgrading through the pre-GA releases and had an exceptional experience with the helpful Rook community,” said Christian Hüning, technical director at Finleap Connect. “It is running flawless and delivers us the performance and resilience we require for our most critical business applications.”</p>



<p>“These are air-gapped installs running critical software on Kubernetes,” said Marc Campbell, founder and CTO at Replicated. “We rely on Rook to manage Ceph so that we get highly-available, redistributable block and object store without having to build it ourselves.”</p>



<p>“We’re happy to see the maturity of the project as it has gone through the different phases within the CNCF ecosystem and its introduction of the various other backends that we could use in the future,” said Moh Ahmed, cloud infrastructure engineer at the Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks.</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project has achieved passing level criteria for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1724">CII Best Practices</a> and adopted its own <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a> structure.</p>

<h4>Part 1 - Complexity</h4>
<p>This world is a complex, interconnected web of systems. We've tried to make sense of this by creating various (seemingly-unrelated) disciplines. With the huge number of disciplines, I think you'll agree with me when I say that it's impossible for any one person to be an expert in all of these fields.</p>
<p>It's turtles all the way down, however, and even as you go deeper into a field, there's still so much complexity that you would despair at the idea of ever really understanding anything even within the confines of one specific field.</p>
<p>Most fields seem to exhibit a fractal pattern. By this, I mean that the more you try to <em>zoom in</em> onto a specific aspect of a system, the more detail is revealed. The same is true whether you're talking about economics or physics or biology. A whole new world of detail is revealed at all the different levels.</p>
<p>Of course, when confronted with complexity, our first instinct is to <em>reduce</em> and to treat these in isolation, and we've tried to come to terms with the complexity within fields by creating <strong>specializations</strong>, which are essentially sub-fields. </p>
<p>This is why a microbiologist seems to speak a completely different language from an ecologist. This might make you wonder whether the two fields are even related; one could argue that they both view the world through a radically different set of lenses.</p>
<p>As human knowledge progresses and we're able to understand systems at different levels, we're continuously spawning newer and newer specializations and hyperspecializations.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this concept clearer than in computer science where incredibly complex systems have been built to deliver cat videos to your screen. There's nothing special about my choice of computer science here, as I'm sure there are similar levels of complexity lurking beneath the surface of any domain.</p>
<p>You could spend years and years in deep study and you still wouldn't really fully <em>get</em> how a computer worked. There would always be gaps in your knowledge. Even behind something as seemingly simple as allowing you to read these words on your screen, there is so much hidden complexity. There are towers and towers of abstractions that enable this to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your CPU (essentially a tiny piece of silicon that can't do much but add two numbers together) executed a few million instructions during the time you were reading this sentence. Welcome to Computer Architecture!</li>
<li>These instructions are in most cases not understandable by a human. So we invented a <em>high-level language</em> and wrote another software to convert this high level language into the instructions. Welcome to Compilers!</li>
<li>There are multiple applications running on this system at the same time; somehow, a piece of code (the Operating System), managed to abstract all this away such that the applications are able to pretend that they're the only application running on the system. Similarly, there are other resources (RAM, files, I/O devices) that all need to be shared between the hundreds of programs running on your system. Welcome to Operating Systems!</li>
<li>Your device doesn't exist in isolation. In fact, a lot of its capabilities arise in relation with other devices. Just for the purpose of loading this website and viewing it, it had to send signals out into the ether which somehow (like a labelled envelope) found its way to the right servers and then they responded back with the data you were requesting. Welcome to Networks!</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, all of the cases above are huge simplifications. I haven't even begun scratching the surface. If you're curious to learn more, <a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when">look at how much detail</a> is hidden behind a simple Google search.</p>
<p>So how do you even begin to understand and make sense of things which seem to have so many interconnected pieces?</p>
<p>A short digression here: there is a famous result in psychology about working memory (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">Miller's Law</a>). It suggests that humans can, on average, hold about 7 objects in their short-term memory at one time. Basically, if you're playing around with concepts in your head and thinking about how things relate with one another, there seems to be a cognitive limit of about 7 items.</p>
<p>Of course that is quite fuzzy and it is of course dangerous to generalize too much from any one result. However, I'd suggest that we can take away this lesson from Miller's Law: humans can't hold too many things in their head at the same time. Software systems are very complex beasts and it's beyond the scope of any person to hold in their head all the minute details of how something is working. </p>
<p>This is where <em>Abstraction</em> comes in. This is one of the fundamental building blocks of Computer Science, Engineering, and Problem Solving in general. Abstraction is when you squint your eyes and treat something as a <em>black box</em>. You are temporarily choosing to not care about what's happening inside the black box because other details are more important. </p>
<p>For an example of abstraction think about <em>interfaces</em> to objects you commonly use. A car for example hides a lot of complicated circuitry and machinery, but at the end of the day, all you need to care about is the steering wheel and a couple of pedals. That's the abstract view of a car. I don't care how that car turns these inputs into the multiple complicated outputs of fuel intake, torque etc. I completely ignore that because it's not important to me. I just want to get from point A to point B and I just need to know how to use the interface of the car to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>A well-designed interface (this is true of software interfaces too!) would allow you to focus on fewer aspects of the car and expend lesser <em>cognitive effort</em> when driving the car; I'm talking about manual vs automatic vs self-driving cars. </p>
<p>Sure, that's all well and good, but this article is about <em>Dealing with Complexity</em>, not about <em>Pretending it doesn't exist</em>. After all, someone does ultimately have to design and work with the underlying complexity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity">Tesler's Law</a>). You'd be a terrible automobile engineer if you were only able to see a car as its interface!</p>
<p>Things are even harder when you're a student and trying to learn more about a certain field you have no prior knowledge in; with so much to learn, how do you decide what is worth digging deeper into?</p>
<p>So hold on to this idea of abstraction, and let's talk about Fractal Learning, which is the focus of this blog post.</p>
<h4>Part 2 - Fractal Learning</h4>
<p>Fractal learning is essentially a strategy used to make sense of complex systems without getting too lost in the details. It's about being in that Goldilocks zone of not wasting your time learning too much (you have other things to do) while at the same time getting an overall understanding of how things fit together.</p>
<p>I first came across this concept in the excellent <a href="https://intermezzos.github.io/book/second-edition/fractal-learning.html">IntermezzOS Book</a>. It beautifully encapsulates the challenges of students and researchers working to make sense of complex systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's impossible to learn everything at once. If you keep digging, you'll find more questions, and digging into those questions leads to more questions... at some point, you have to say "okay, I know enough about this for now, it's time to move on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's that picture of a tree again:</p>
<p><img alt="tree" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/tree.gif"></p>
<p>Let's imagine that this tree represents your field of interest. Your job is to somehow navigate this tree (or a branch) and learn <em>everything</em>. Now, clearly, learning everything isn't going to happen in this lifetime, but you still want to know enough to get a good idea of how everything fits together.</p>
<p>How do you do it?</p>
<p>Most people seem to follow one of two strategies - and these strategies come under the umbrella of <em>tree-traversal algorithms</em> in computer science. </p>
<p>Let's dig a bit deeper into both of these as they are relevant to the discussion.</p>
<p>The first is depth-first search (I call it <em>falling down the rabbit hole</em>). It's represented by this animation<sup id="sf-fractal-learning-1-back"><a href="#sf-fractal-learning-1" title="Source">1</a></sup>:</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/dfs.gif"></center>
<p>Here, you start at the root of the tree (represented by 1) and you keep going deeper and deeper along any one path. You stop when you can go no further and then try one of the other paths.</p>
<p>To better visualize it, here is the same algorithm working to solve a maze<sup id="sf-fractal-learning-2-back"><a href="#sf-fractal-learning-2" title="Source">2</a></sup>:</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/dfsmaze.gif"></center>
<p>I hope you get why I called it falling down the rabbit hole; you're just digging deeper and deeper into a specific topic without really taking a step back to explore other related topics. This is a laser-focused strategy that focuses on exclusion. It's the equivalent of the child who keeps asking "Why?" for a specific topic until she can no longer get a meaningful answer. If someone followed only this strategy for learning about things, she would have very detailed and specific knowledge about that one thing but have absolutely no idea about even closely related things.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the other strategy - breadth-first search (I call it <em>flooding</em>):</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/bfs.gif"></center>
<p>This is the polar opposite of the previous approach. Here you are quite timid, and you never go more than one level at a time, and you make your way level-by-level.</p>
<p>Here it is again, within the maze context<sup id="sf-fractal-learning-3-back"><a href="#sf-fractal-learning-3" title="Source">3</a></sup>:</p>
<center><img alt="dfs" src="https://reisub0.github.io/images/bfsmaze.gif"></center>
<p>Again, I hope it makes sense why I called it flooding; it works similarly to how water slowly rises to flood an area. Here you dig very shallowly and take the time to understand the basics of everything before making your way deeper. This is focused on being inclusive and getting a sense of how everything fits together, even if it's not relevant. Someone who followed only this strategy would be a jack of all trades, he would know the fundamentals of everything; but like the figure of speech goes, he would be a master of none.</p>
<p>So which should you follow: breadth-first or depth-first?</p>
<p>Sadly, as with a lot of things in life, the answer is: it depends. You will have to use your judgment and intuition to decide which approach to use depending on the situation. Both approaches have their trade-offs.</p>
<p>Of course, given enough time, both approaches would cover the entire tree. As we saw, both approaches managed to solve the maze.</p>
<p>But we don't really have much time, do we?</p>
<p>In the following examples (both of which are …</p></div></div>

<p>Apple is requesting that Telegram shut down three channels used in Belarus to expose the identities of individuals belonging to the Belarusian authoritarian regime that may be oppressing civilians. Apple’s concern is that revealing the identities of law enforcement individuals may give rise to further violence.</p>
<p>Telegram, however, would prefer to keep the channels open, but the company said that it feels it has no choice in the matter. These channels are a tool for Belarus’ citizens protesting the recently rigged presidential election, but, with a centralized entity like Apple calling the shots on its own App Store, there’s little the protesters can do about it, explains Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.</p>

<p>“I think this situation is not black and white and would rather leave the channels be, but typically Apple doesn’t offer much choice for apps like Telegram in such situations,” Durov wrote in his Telegram channel.</p>
<p>The tension between Apple and Telegram is part of the wider issue surrounding Belarus’ 2020 election, which saw incumbent Alexander Lukashenko re-elected despite claims and evidence the election was rigged. The result has seen thousands of Belarusian citizens take to the streets to protest.</p>
<p>This tension also highlights a problem with centralized app stores. “Unfortunately, I assume these channels will end up getting blocked on iOS, but remain available on other platforms,” Durov added.</p>

                        <p><span>If you drive the&nbsp;long stretch of Interstate 5 known as the Westside Freeway, from the foot of&nbsp;the Grapevine through Buttonwillow and on to Los Banos, you’ll be cruising along the edge of the richest and most productive farm land in the world. If, halfway through that journey, you stop at a place called Kettleman City (a name more ambitious than accurate) and stand at the edge of the parking lot behind the In-and-Out Burger looking due east down a gentle slope, you’ll be staring at what was once the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Of course, from your perch at the In-and-Out, you won’t see any water. Tulare Lake is long gone, all 700 square miles of it; its water restrained behind dams in the foothills and channelled away into the irrigation canals that make the Central Valley so productive. In its place are hundreds of square miles of cotton and corn, and an elaborate system of drains, ditches, channels and sumps designed to keep the lake bed farmable.</p>
<p><span>The massive rearranging of California’s water resources, which began with the Gold Rush and continues to the present day, is a triumph of ingenuity and engineering, and the utter destruction of the original, pre-1849 biome.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Before to the discovery of gold, the Central Valley was far wetter than it is today. In a sense, the valley respirated water, breathing in during the wet seasons and breathing out during the dry. In winter when the rains came and in spring when the snow melted, water poured into the valley, swelling the rivers and filling the low places with seasonal lakes, bogs, potholes and vernal pools. When the rains stopped in late spring, and the weather turned hot, the remaining water evaporated and the grasses dried up. </span></p>

<p><span>The hydraulic system of the Central Valley has three main zones: the Sacramento Valley, the northern San Joaquin Valley and the southern San Joaquin Valley, also&nbsp;called the Tulare Basin. Water from the two northernmost zones flow into San Francisco Bay via the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers which meet east of the bay in the Delta, the largest estuary in the western United States.&nbsp;</span><span>The third zone, the southern San Joaquin Valley, is usually&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Endorheic_basin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorheic</a>. </span></p>
<p>Before the replumbing of the rivers, in most years water did not leave the Tulare Basin. In wet years, however, Tulare Lake overflowed into the San Joaquin River, sending water up through the Delta and out the Golden Gate. There were two other lakes at the far southern end of the valley, Kern Lake and Buena Vista Lake, both now drained away by canals and dams. During the wettest years these lakes would also overflow, linking up with each other and Tulare Lake to form a single, vast body of water. The missing lakes and the tens of thousands of acres of tule swamp and grassland that ringed them thus waxed and waned with the seasons, part of a complex ecology that supported enough fish, fowl and fauna to make it one of the richest biomes in the world.</p>
<p><span>The arrival of the Spanish settlers to California in the 18</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span> century did little to upset the natural arrangement of the Central Valley. Beyond stock grazing, the <em>californios</em> had little interest in the interior of the state; it was too far from the coast and too hot in the summer for their tastes. Better to stay in Monterey and Santa Barbara and let the <em>indios</em> have the Central Valley.</span></p>

<p><span>For their part, the natives of the Central Valley were content to hunt and gather rather than cultivate.&nbsp;</span>Acorns from the oaks that lined the creeks and rivers were gathered in baskets and stored in holes until needed. Birds and wild game were hunted with throwing sticks and bows and arrows, or trapped in snares.&nbsp;<span>A simple wicker fish weir in a creek yielded hundreds of pounds of salmon during the spring and winter runs. This bounty, when dried, could feed the tribe for months.&nbsp;</span><span>(In the wet years, the salmon even made it from the San Joaquin River into Tulare Lake, to the great joy of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.calwater.ca.gov/Admin_Record/C-076127.pdf">Yokut</a><span> who lived in the tule reeds along its banks.) </span></p>
<p><span>As one wag has said, if the pilgrims had landed in California instead of Plymouth Rock, the rest of the country would never have been settled. Indeed, the Anglos who began to enter the state in the early decades of the 19</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span> century —&nbsp;</span><span>Yankee merchants, run away sailors and fur trappers —&nbsp;</span><span>were dismissive of both the californios and the indians, and for the same reason, because they were insufficiently industrious, content to herd cattle or fish salmon rather than develop the land to its “full potential”. </span></p>
<p><span>The modern settlement of the Central Valley began&nbsp;when Americans started to arrive overland via the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. Many of these newcomers became Mexican citizens, took Mexican wives, and received Mexican land grants along the Sacramento, Feather and American Rivers, grants that&nbsp;were measured in Spanish leagues (4,428 acres), of which five leagues would be considered the usual size. By 1846, when the last of the Mexican land grants were made, much of the Valley had been parceled out. </span></p>
<p><span>As for the people who were already there,<span>&nbsp;</span>perhaps half of the Central Valley indians died in 1833, a year after mountain man Ewing Young&nbsp;led a group of trappers through the valley, inadvertently spreading malaria as they went. Parts of the valley were “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YXBWkiIkk54C&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=malaria+california+1832&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K10ZxvJzEO&amp;sig=BWUq5PvdFtka80UUQA7PppI18hs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIxeSbhsqQxgIVBpyICh20kAU2#v=onepage&amp;q=malaria%20california%201832&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtually depopulat[ed]</a>” by the disease, and the survivors left scattered, weakened, and easily pushed aside or exploited by the American settlers.<span>&nbsp;</span>By 1845, the number of indians in all of California was probably 150,000, about half of what it had been when the Spanish arrived 70 years earlier. Fifteen years later, in 1860,<span>&nbsp; </span>a dozen years&nbsp;after the discovery of gold, there were only 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span>All of this, however, is prequel to the real topic, why California landscape&nbsp;and wildlife are so radically different from what they were, and why the biggest changes happened&nbsp;in those dozen years after 1848.</span></p>

<p><span>Most&nbsp;accounts of the environmental damage caused by the Gold Rush focus on the easily explained, direct effects of mining. Washing away entire hillsides with water monitors sent mountains of debris into the rivers; processing the resultant slurry with buckets of mercury <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2000/fs06100/pdf/fs06100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poisoned the soil</a>. &nbsp;However, t</span><span>he most lasting changes to California’s waterways, landscapes and biomes were caused by trying to feed the miners and settlers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>100,000 newcomers headed for California in first year and half of the Gold Rush, 50,000 in the first five months came overland from the United States, alone, and much has been said about the famously difficult trip they endured. Less has been said, however, about the difficulty of feeding all of those men in a place where there were few farms or fishing boats, most of which, in any event, were abandoned minutes after the news of gold was announced.</span></p>

These will have practical usages and would most likely be on many-core CPUs or CUDA GPUs. Today’s is the first one to discuss a parallel algorithm implementation for CSV file parser.</em></p>

<p>In the old days, when our spin disk speed maxed out at 100MiB/s, we only have two choices: either we don’t care about the file loading time at all, treating it as a cost of life, or we have a file format entangled with the underlying memory representation to squeeze out the last bits of performance for data loading.</p>

<p>That world has long gone. My current workstation uses a software RAID0 (mdadm) over two 1TB Samsung 970 EVO NVMe storage for data storage. This setup usually gives me around 2GiB/s read / write speed (you can read more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3JYEIsjH8">about my workstation here</a>).</p>

<p>The CSV file format is firmly in the former category of the two. The thing that people who exchange CSV files care most, above anything else, is the interoperability. Serious people who actually care about speed and efficiency moved to other formats such as <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> or <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>. But CSV files live on. It is still by far the most common format in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/docs/datasets">Kaggle</a> contests.</p>

<p>There exist many implementations for CSV file parsers. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a> would be two common implementations. That doesn’t account for standard implementations such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">the one from Python</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these implementations shy away from utilizing many-cores. It is a reasonable choice. In many likely scenarios, you would load many small-ish CSV files, and these can be done in parallel at task-level. That is an OK choice until recently, when I have to deal with some many GiBs CSV files. These files can take many seconds to load, even from tmpfs. That indicates a performance bottleneck at CPU parsing time.</p>

<p>The most obvious way to overcome the CPU parsing bottleneck is to fully utilize the 32 cores of Threadripper 3970x. This can be embarrassingly simple if we can reliably breakdown the parsing by rows. Unfortunately, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> prevents us from simply using line breaks as row delimiters. Particularly, when quoted, a cell content can contain line breaks and these will not be recognized as row delimiters.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a> first implemented a two-pass approach for parallel CSV parsing. Later it is documented in <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/chunker-sigmod19.pdf">Speculative Distributed CSV Data Parsing for Big Data Analytics</a></em>. The paper discussed, besides the two-pass approach, a more sophisticated speculative approach that is suitable for the higher-latency distributed environment.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I implemented a variant of the two-pass approach that can max out the NVMe storage bandwidth. It is an interesting journey as I didn’t write any serious parser in C for a very long time.</p>

<h3 id="the-csv-file-parsing-problem">The CSV File Parsing Problem</h3>

<p>CSV file represents simple tabular data with rows and columns. Thus, to parse a CSV file, it is meant to divide a text file into cells that can be uniquely identified with row and column index.</p>

<p>In C++, this can be done in zero-copy fashion with <code>string_view</code>. In C, every string has to be null-terminated. Thus, you need to either manipulate the original buffer, or copy it over. I elected the latter.</p>

<h3 id="memory-mapped-file">Memory-Mapped File</h3>

<p>To simplify the parser implementation, it is assumed we are given a block of memory that is the content of the CSV file. This can be done in C with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="openmp">OpenMP</h3>

<p>We are going to use <a href="https://openmp.llvm.org/">OpenMP</a>’s parallel for-loop to implement the core algorithm. Nowadays, Clang has pretty comprehensive support for OpenMP. But nevertheless, we will only use the very trivial part of what OpenMP provides.</p>

<h3 id="find-the-right-line-breaks">Find the Right Line Breaks</h3>

<p>To parallel parse a CSV file, we first need to break it down into chunks. We can divide the file into 1MiB sequence of bytes as our chunks. Within each chunk, we can start to find the right line breaks.</p>

<p>The double-quote in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> can quote a line break, that makes us find the right line breaks harder. But at the same time, the RFC defines the way to <em>escape</em> double-quote by using two double-quote back-to-back. With this, if we count double-quotes from the beginning of a file, we know that a line break is within a quoted cell if we encounter an odd number of double-quotes so far. If we encounter an even number of double-quotes before a line break, we know that is a beginning of a new row.</p>

<p>We can count double-quotes from the beginning of each chunk. However, because we don’t know if there are an odd or even number of double-quotes before this chunk, we cannot differentiate whether a line break is the starting point of a new row, or just within a quoted cell. What we do know, though, is that a line break after an odd number of double-quotes within a chunk is the same class of line breaks. We simply don’t know at that point which class that is. We can count these two classes separately.</p>

<p>This is our first pass.</p>

<h3 id="columns-and-rows">Columns and Rows</h3>

<p>After the first pass, we can sequentially go through each chunk’s statistics to calculate how many rows and columns in the given CSV file.</p>

<p>The line breaks in the first chunk after even number of double-quotes would be the number of rows in the first chunk. Because we know the number of double-quotes in the first chunk, we now know what class of line breaks in the second chunk are the start points of a row. The sum of these line breaks would be the number of rows.</p>

<p>For the number of columns, we can go through the first row and count the number of column delimiters outside of double-quotes.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-the-cell-strings">Wiring the Cell Strings</h3>

<p>The second pass will copy the chunks over, null-terminate each cell, escape the double-quotes if possible. We can piggyback our logic on top of the chunks allocated for the first pass. However, unlike the first pass, the parsing logic doesn’t start at the very beginning of each chunk. It starts at the first starting point of a row in that chunk and ends at the first starting point of a row in the next chunk.</p>

<p>The second pass turns out to occupy the most of our parsing time, simply because it does most of the string manipulations and copying in this pass.</p>

<h3 id="more-optimizations">More Optimizations</h3>

<p>Both the first pass and second pass unrolled into 8-byte batch parsing, rather than per-byte parsing. For the second pass, we did some bit-twiddling to quickly check whether there are delimiters, double-quotes, or line breaks that needed to be processed, or we can simply copy it over.</p>

<p>The above performance accounts for the best you can get if file IO is not a concern. With the said 970 EVO RAID0, we can run another round of benchmark against the real disk IO. Note that for this round of benchmark, we need to drop system file cache with: <code>sudo bash -c "echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"</code> before each …</p></div></div>

<b></b><p><b>Abstract</b>. Lamport showed that a replicated deterministic state machine is a general way to implement a highly available system, given a consensus algorithm that the replicas can use to agree on each input. His Paxos algorithm is the most fault-tolerant way to get consensus without real-time guarantees. Because general consensus is expensive, practical systems reserve it for emergencies and use leases (locks that time out) for most of the computing. This paper explains the general scheme for efficient highly available computing, gives a general method for understanding concurrent and fault-tolerant programs, and derives the Paxos algorithm as an example of the method.</p>
<b><span size="4"><p>1. Introduction</p>
</span></b><p>A system is available if it provides service promptly on demand. The only way to make a highly available system out of less available components is to use redundancy, so the system can work even when some of its parts are broken. The simplest kind of redundancy is replication: make several copies or ‘replicas’ of each part.</p>
<p>This paper explains how to build efficient highly available systems out of replicas, and it gives a careful specification and an informal correctness proof for the key algorithm. Nearly all of the ideas are due to Leslie Lamport: replicated state machines [5], the Paxos consensus algorithm [7], and the methods of specifying and analyzing concurrent systems [6]. I wrote the paper because after I had read Lamport’s papers, it still took me a long time to understand these methods and how to use them effectively. Surprisingly few people seem to know about them in spite of their elegance and power. </p>
<p>In the next section we explain how to build a replicated state machine that is both efficient and highly available, given a fault-tolerant algorithm for consensus. Section 3 gives some background on the consensus problem and its applications. Section 4 reviews the method we use for writing specifications and uses it to give a precise specification for consensus in several forms. In section 5 we introduce the basic idea behind the Paxos algorithm for consensus and derive the algorithm from this idea and the specification. Finally we explain some important optimizations and summarize our conclusions. </p>
<b><span size="4"><p>2. Replicated State Machines</p>
</span></b><p>Redundancy is not enough; to be useful it must be coordinated. The simplest way to do this is to make each non-faulty replica do the same thing. Then any non-faulty replica can provide the outputs; if the replicas are not fail-stop, requiring the same output from f replicas will tolerate f – 1 faults. More complicated kinds of redundancy (such as error-correcting codes) are cheaper, but they depend on special properties of the service being provided.</p>
<p>In this section we explain how to coordinate the replicas in a fully general and highly fault tolerant way. Then we explore an optimization called ‘leases’ that makes the coordination very efficient in nearly all cases.</p>
<b><p>2.1 Coordinating the Replicas</p>
</b><p>How can we arrange for each replica to do the same thing? Adopting a scheme first proposed by Lamport [5], we build each replica as a deterministic state machine; this means that the transition relation is a function from (state, input) to (new state, output). It is customary to call one of these replicas a ‘process’. Several processes that start in the same state and see the same sequence of inputs will do the same thing, that is, end up in the same state and produce the same outputs. So all we need for high availability is to ensure that all the non-faulty processes see the same inputs. The technical term for this is ‘consensus’ (sometimes called ‘agreement’ or ‘reliable broadcast’). Informally, we say that several processes achieve consensus if they all agree on some value; we give a formal definition later on.</p>
<p>So if several processes are implementing the same deterministic state machine and achieve consensus on the values and order of the inputs, they will do the same thing. In this way it’s possible to replicate an arbitrary computation and thus make it highly available. Of course we can make the order a part of the input value by defining some total order on the set of inputs, for instance by numbering them 1, 2, 3, ... </p>
<p>In many applications the inputs are requests from clients to the replicated service. For example, a replicated storage service might have Read(a) and Write(a, d) inputs, and an airplane flight control system might have ReadInstrument(i) and RaiseFlaps(d) inputs. Different clients usually generate their requests independently, so it’s necessary to agree not only on what the requests are, but also on the order in which to serve them. The simplest way to do this is to number them with consecutive integers, starting at 1. This is done in ‘primary copy’ replication, since it’s easy for one process (the primary) to assign consecutive numbers. So the storage service will agree on Input 1 = Write(x, 3) and Input 2 = Read(x).</p>
<p>There are many other schemes for achieving consensus on the order of requests when their total order is not derived from consecutive integers; see Schneider’s survey [11]. These schemes label each input with some value from a totally ordered set (for instance, (client UID, timestamp) pairs) and then devise a way to be certain that you have seen all the inputs that can ever exist with labels smaller than a given value. This is complicated, and practical systems usually use a primary to sequence the inputs instead.</p>
<b><p>2.2 Leases: Efficient Highly Available Computing</p>
</b><p>Fault-tolerant consensus is expensive. Exclusive access by a single process (also known as locking) is cheap, but it is not fault-tolerant—if a process fails while it is holding a lock, no one else can access the resource. Adding a timeout to a lock makes a fault-tolerant lock or ‘lease’. Thus a process holds a lease on a state component or ‘resource’ until an expiration time; we say that the process is the ‘master’ for the resource while it holds the lease. No other process will touch the resource until the lease expires. For this to work, of course, the processes must have synchronized clocks. More precisely, if the maximum skew between the clocks of two processes is e and process P’s lease expires at time t, then P knows that no other process will touch the resource before time t – e on P’s clock.</p>
<p>While it holds the lease the master can read and write the resource freely. Writes must take bounded time, so that they can be guaranteed either to fail or to precede any operation that starts after the lease expires; this can be a serious problem for a resource such as a SCSI disk, which has weak ordering guarantees and a long upper bound on the time a write can take.</p>
<p>Locks in transaction processing systems are usually leases; if they expire the transaction is aborted, which means that its writes are undone and the transaction is equivalent to skip. A process that uses leases outside the scope of a transaction must take care to provide whatever atomicity is necessary, for example, by ensuring that the resource is in a good state after every atomic write (this is called ‘careful writes’), or by using standard redo or undo methods based on logs [4]. The latter is almost certainly necessary if the resource being leased is itself replicated.</p>
<p>A process can keep control of a resource by renewing its lease before it expires. It can also release its lease, perhaps on demand. If you can’t talk to the process that holds the lease, however (perhaps because it has failed), you have to wait for the lease to expire before touching its resource. So there is a tradeoff between the cost of renewing a lease and the time you have to wait for the lease to expire after a (possible) failure. A short lease means a short wait during recovery but a higher cost to renew the lease. A long lease means a long wait during recovery but a lower cost to renew.</p>
<p>A lease is most often used to give a process the right to cache some part of the state, for instance the contents of a cache line or of a file, knowing that it can’t change. Since a lease is a kind of lock, it can have a ‘mode’ which determines what operations its holder can do. If the lease is exclusive, then its process can change the leased state freely. This is like ‘owner’ access to a cache line or ownership of a multi-ported disk.</p>
<b><p>2.3 Hierarchical Leases</p>
</b><p>In a fault-tolerant system leases must be granted and renewed by running consensus. If this much use of consensus is still too expensive, the solution is hierarchical leases. Run consensus once to elect a czar <i>C</i> and give <i>C</i> a lease on a large part of the state. Now <i>C</i> gives out sub-leases on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> to masters. Each master controls its own resources. The masters renew their sub-leases with the czar. This is cheap since it doesn’t require any coordination. The czar renews its lease by consensus. This costs more, but there’s only one czar lease. Also, the czar can be simple and less likely to fail, so a longer lease may be acceptable. </p>
<p>Hierarchical leases are commonly used in replicated file systems and in clusters.</p>
<p>By combining the ideas of consensus, leases, and hierarchy, it’s possible to build highly available systems that are also highly efficient.</p>
<b><span size="4"><p>3. Consensus</p>
</span></b><p>Several processes achieve consensus if they all agree on some allowed value called the ‘outcome’ (if they could agree on any value the solution would be trivial: always agree on 0). Thus the …</p></div>

		<p>One fairly common complaint about postgres is that is that each connection uses
too much memory. Often made when comparing postgres' connection model to one
where each connection is assigned a dedicated thread, instead of the current
model where each connection has a dedicated process.</p>
<p>To be clear: This is a worthwhile discussion to have. And there are several
important improvements we could make to reduce memory usage.</p>
<p>That said, I think one common cause of these concerns is that the easy ways to
measure the memory usage of a postgres backend, like <code>top</code> and <code>ps</code>, are quite
misleading.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly hard to accurately measure the increase in memory usage by
an additional connection.</p>
<p>In this post I’m mostly going to talk about running Postgres on Linux, since
that is what I have the most experience with.</p>
<p>My bold claim is that, <strong>when measuring accurately</strong>, a <strong>connection only has
an overhead of less than 2MiB</strong> (see <a href="#conclusion">conclusion</a>).</p>
<h2 id="a-first-look">A first look</h2>
<p>Just using the common operating system tools make the overhead look much bigger
than it actually is. Especially when not utilizing
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS">huge_pages</a>
(not recommended), the memory usage for each process will look high.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at a freshly established connection, in a freshly started
postgres cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">andres@awork3:~$ psql
postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT pg_backend_pid();</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ pg_backend_pid │
├────────────────┤
│        <span>2003213</span> │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

andres@awork3:~/src/postgresql$ ps -q <span>2003213</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>2003213</span> <span>16944</span>
</code></pre></div><p>About 16MiB.</p>
<h2 id="massive-leaks-luckily-not">Massive leaks!?! Luckily not.</h2>
<p>What’s worse, the memory usage will appear to grow over time. To show this
problem, I’ll use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgprewarm.html">pgprewarm</a>
extension to load all pages in a table into postgres' buffer pool:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SHOW shared_buffers ;</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ shared_buffers │
├────────────────┤
│ 16GB           │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT SUM(pg_prewarm(oid, 'buffer')) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
┌────────┐
│  sum   │
├────────┤
│ <span>383341</span> │
└────────┘

andres@awork3:~$ ps -q <span>2003213</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>2003213</span> <span>3169144</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now postgres memory usage appears to be around 3GB. Even though the individual
connection did not actually allocate much additional memory. The added memory
usage is proportional to the amount of shared buffers touched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_relation_size(oid))) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ pg_size_pretty │
├────────────────┤
│ <span>2995</span> MB        │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And even worse than that, if yet another connection also uses those pages, it
will also show as having a huge memory usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>3244960<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT sum(abalance) FROM pgbench_accounts ;</span>
┌─────┐
│ sum │
├─────┤
│   <span>0</span> │
└─────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

andres@awork3:~/src/postgresql$ ps -q <span>3244960</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3244960</span> <span>2700372</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Of course postgres does not actually use 3+2.7 GiB of memory in this
case. Instead, what is happening is that, with <code>huge_pages=off</code> off, ps will
attribute the amount of shared memory, including the buffer pool, that a
connection has utilized for each connection. Obviously leading to vastly
over-estimating memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="huge-pages-accidentally-kind-of-save-the-day">Huge pages accidentally kind of save the day</h2>
<p>Many CPU micro-architectures normally use a page size of 4KiB, but also
optionally can use larger page sizes, most commonly 2MiB.</p>
<p>Depending on operating system, configuration, and the type of applications used
such larger pages can be utilized transparently by the operating system, or
explicitly by applications. See e.g.
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Hugepages">Debian wiki page about huge pages</a> for some
details.</p>
<p>Repeating the previous experiments with <code>huge_pages=on</code> makes them look a lot
better. First, looking at a “new connection”:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">andres@awork3:~$ ps -q <span>3245907</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3245907</span>  <span>7612</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, a new connection now appears to use only about ~7MiB. This reduction in
memory usage is caused by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table">page table</a>
needing less memory, as it now only needs to contain <code>1/512</code>th of the previous
entries, due to the larger page size.</p>
<p>And more importantly, the test where a lot of the memory is accessed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>3245843<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># ;SELECT SUM(pg_prewarm(oid, 'buffer')) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
…
postgres<span>[</span>3245851<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT sum(abalance) FROM pgbench_accounts ;</span>
…

andres@awork3:~$ ps -q 3245907,3245974 -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3245907</span> <span>12260</span>
<span>3245974</span>  <span>8936</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In contrast to above, these connections now appear to only use 12MiB and 9MiB
respectively, where previously they used 3GiB and 2.7GiB. Quite the apparent
change ;)</p>
<p>This is due to the way the use of larger pages is implemented in Linux, not
because we used orders of magnitude less memory: huge pages used just aren’t
shown as part of the <code>RSS</code> column of ps/top.</p>
<h2 id="getting-less-unreal">Getting less unreal</h2>
<p>Since Linux 4.5 the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=rssanon"><code>/proc/$pid/status</code></a>
file shows the memory usage split into finer sub-categories:</p>
<pre><code>VmRSS		size of memory portions. It contains the three following parts (VmRSS = RssAnon + RssFile + RssShmem)
RssAnon		size of resident anonymous memory
RssFile		size of resident file mappings
RssShmem	size of resident shmem memory (includes SysV shm, mapping of tmpfs and shared anonymous mappings)
</code></pre><p>Looking at these stats with <code>huge_pages=off</code>:</p>

the shared memory accesses.</p>

<p>Just adding up the memory usage of the non-shmem values still over-estimates
memory usage. There’s two main reasons:</p>
<p>First, it doesn’t actually make sense to include <code>RssFile</code> when measuring a
postgres backend’s memory usage - for postgres that overwhelmingly just are the
postgres binary and the shared libraries it uses (postgres does not <code>mmap()</code>
files). As nearly all of that is shared between all processes in the system,
it’s not a per-connection overhead.</p>
<p>Secondly, even just looking at <code>RssAnon</code> over-estimates memory usage.  The
reason for that is that ps measures the entire memory of the process, even
though the majority of a new connection’s overhead is shared between the user
connection and the supervisor process. This is because Linux does not copy all
memory when <code>fork()</code>ing a new process, instead it uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">Copy-on-write</a> to only copy pages
when modified.</p>
<p>There is no good way to accurately measure the memory usage of an individual
forked process, but since version 4.14 the Linux kernel at least provides an
approximation
(<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=493b0e9d945fa9dfe96be93ae41b4ca4b6fdb317">commit with description</a>)
in a process' <code>/proc/[pid]/smaps_rollup</code> file. <code>Pss</code> shows the “the process’
proportional share of this mapping” across all of a process' mappings (Search
linux’s documentation page for
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=smaps_rollup">smaps_rollup</a>
and
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=Pss">Pss</a>,
which unfortunately does not have direct links). For memory shared between
processes it will divide the memory usage by the number of processes using a
mapping.</p>

                    <p>Over the last 2 years, <a href="https://metaview.ai/" rel="noopener nofollow">Metaview</a> has gathered data from tens of thousands of hours of interviews. Metaview’s technology records and transcribes these interviews, then automatically enriches this already valuable asset with data-points that are associated with effective interviewing.</p><p>For example: Candidate speaking time, question count, % of time spent on sharing context, interruptions. These are just some of the unique interview metrics Metaview gathers. We then evaluate how these metrics impact KPIs top organizations already care about such as hiring funnel conversion rate, offer-acceptance rates, interviewer calibration, and candidate NPS.</p><p>This is the most robust and richest data set of its type on the planet.</p><p>One of the things we’re most passionate about is using this data to help individuals improve as interviewers. With that in mind, we wanted to share some of the most common and easily addressable mistakes we have seen new and inexperienced interviewers make.</p><p>If you’re a new interviewer yourself, this should help you immediately consider some changes to your style.</p><p>If you’re a talent leader, this should help guide you on how you can most influence the quality of interviews being conducted within your organization.</p><p>Most people that are new to interviewing cover the basics of a personal introduction (though, 16% do forget to do even that!). However, Metaview data shows us that <strong><strong>only 28% of new interviewers set expectations for the interview</strong></strong> with the candidate.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.metaview.ai/content/images/2020/10/you-x-ventures-Ti7LQ0r-zy4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Image for post" srcset="https://blog.metaview.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/you-x-ventures-Ti7LQ0r-zy4-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://blog.metaview.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/you-x-ventures-Ti7LQ0r-zy4-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://blog.metaview.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/you-x-ventures-Ti7LQ0r-zy4-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://blog.metaview.ai/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/you-x-ventures-Ti7LQ0r-zy4-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Setting expectations means that the structure and purpose of the interview are clear in the mind of the candidate. This is vital because:</p><ul><li>It reduces any anxiety the candidate may have around <em><em>when</em></em> they’ll get a chance to show their capabilities, or ask their questions. This improves the flow of an interview.</li><li>It reduces anxiety around <em><em>how</em></em> they are being judged, and makes it clear what they need to demonstrate in the interview. This improves the candidate’s sense of closure at the end of the interview.</li><li>Sharing these expectations often serves an explicit reminder to the interviewer themselves on what they need to cover.</li></ul><h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2><p>After a high-level introduction, interviewers can outline the structure and purpose of the interview using the following format: <em><em>“The aim of this interview is to learn more about [x]. I’ll [y], and I’d love for you to [z]. I’ll keep an eye on time and make sure we have [n] minutes for your questions at the end. Sound good?”</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Example 1</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>“The aim of this interview is to learn more about your experiences as an Account Executive. I’ll ask a few questions about some specific experiences you have, and I’d love for you to get into the detail on these situations as much as possible. I’ll keep an eye on time and make sure we have 10 minutes for your questions at the end. Sound good?”</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Example 2</strong></strong></p><p><em><em>“The aim of this interview is to learn more about the way you break down complex problems. I’ll lay out a couple of example scenarios, and I’d love for you to approach the conversation as if I was on your team and we were working on solving this together. I’ll keep an eye on time and make sure we have 10 minutes for your questions at the end. Sound good?”</em></em></p><p>Do this, and you’ll find interviews will run smoother, and will reveal more about the actual thing you’re looking to learn about.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

It is crucial that both parties come away from the conversation more informed about the chance of there being a fit than they were before the interview.</p><p>Based on Metaview data, <strong><strong>59% of new interviewers fail to focus the majority of their questions on real experiences</strong></strong> (through behavioural questions), and a whopping <strong><strong>83% don’t ask for a single concrete example</strong></strong> from the candidate’s past throughout the entirety of the interview.</p><p>The problem here is that it has been proven that past performance is the best predictor of future performance, so if interviews are not covering real past situations and actions then it is unlikely you are coming away with reliable learnings.</p><h2 id="what-to-do-1">What to do</h2><p>New interviewers too often ask vague questions that can easily be answered with a picture-book answer devoid of detail. As a rule, if you’re asking the candidate about something you expect they should have experience with, then it is best to focus the questions on those experiences.</p><p><strong><strong>Example 1</strong></strong></p><p>⚠️ Don’t ask: <em><em>“How do you manage stakeholders?”</em></em></p><p>🙌 Ask: <em><em>“What techniques have worked well for you when managing lots of stakeholders?”</em></em></p><p>🤯 Or, if you really want to get the detail: <em><em>“Can you tell me about a specific time you had many stakeholders you had to manage and how you went about doing that?”</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>Example 2</strong></strong></p><p>⚠️ Don’t ask: <em><em>“What sort of a teams do you like to be a part of?”</em></em></p><p>🙌 Ask: <em><em>“What sort of teams have you most enjoyed being part of in the past?”</em></em></p><p>🤯 Or, if you really want to get detail: <em><em>“Thinking about the team you’ve been in where you were performing at your best, can you tell me what the key characteristics of that team were?”</em></em></p><p>As you get closer and closer to the concrete detail, the chances of an unsatisfactory answer increase. This is exactly why new interviewers tend to avoid these, but it’s also exactly what the hiring team needs to learn!</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

The most effective ways to improve in these areas are to ensure your new interviewers have an opportunity to see what good looks like, and are receiving regular and structured feedback.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>
<p>Challenged to write about a single Unicode character, I chose the humble asterisk. In this post, Julia takes a back seat but it’s working hard behind the scenes. <sup id="fnref:Franklin1"><a href="#fndef:Franklin1">[1]</a></sup> The font used for the examples is JuliaMono.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The asterisk has a long history. The first appearance of this simple mark was probably on a cave wall somewhere, but we like to assign inventions to known individuals, so the inventor of the asterisk was: Aristarchus of Samothrace, in about 200 BCE.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that this wasn’t the other Aristarchus, Aristarchus of Samos, the famous mathematician with an interest in astronomy, because ἀστερίσκος means “little star”. The man from Samothrace howrver was a librarian, scholar, critic, and proofreader, who liked to make numerous marks (*) in the margin of texts and manuscripts, like notes, queries, and critical comments.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2a-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>* Like this.</p>
<p>As well as writing little stars in the margin he also used other marks, such as the one we now call the reference mark (<code>\u203b</code>)*.</p>
<p>* Perhaps this was a refinement of the asterisk, or perhaps it came first. They look quite similar...</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-203b-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>This use of the asterisk and related marks has continued right up to the present day. Medieval scribes and scholars used a range of symbols to indicate their marginal annotations, and these continued as the printing revolution superseded hand-written manuscripts. Marginal notes were often replaced by footnotes, and the asterisk and dagger were the primary two symbols used for indicating these.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2a_2020-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>Another name for the dagger was the obelisk, hence the comic book characters Asterix and Obelix (which are probably familiar to you if you grew up in Europe).</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/asterix.jpeg" alt="asterix and obelisk"></p>
<p>If you’re writing a book, you can re-use these two indicators on every page, but if you want more than two footnotes on the same page, you have to reach into some of the less rarely seen marks, such as the double dagger (a ‘diesis’); the triple dagger; the section sign; the pilcrow; the ‘parallel to’; and the asterism.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2021_2e4b_a7_b6_2225_2042-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>Medieval scribes, and readers who enjoy writing in the margins of books, can get carried away with the possibilities. The pointing hand or manicule* is also seen in the margins of manuscripts, and adds some human interest to the dullest of scriptural documents.</p>
<div><p>* also called the printers’ fist</p>
<p>☜</p></div>
<p>If you run out of symbols, you might have to start doubling up on them. A heavily-footnoted page could work through the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodestring-1602263615373276e9-tidy.svg" alt="image"></p><p>But by now you’re probably using too many footnotes on a single page. It could be time to switch to numbered footnotes, numbered from 1 to n for the whole chapter rather than starting at 1 on each page. These days, we can leave it to the software (such as \( \LaTeX \) or, for this web page, Franklin <sup id="fnref:Franklin2"><a href="#fndef:Franklin2">[2]</a></sup>) to do that for us.</p>
<h2 id="aspersion"><a href="#aspersion">Aspersion</a></h2>
<p>To this day, the word “asterisk” carries with it a few additional meanings derived from its history as a pointer to important additional content. It’s used in advertising, to indicate the presence of small print which you should probably read - but perhaps they hope you don’t. In American journalism, often dominated by sport and politics, the word “asterisk” has come to mean “no, you’d better read more about this before you decide what to think”. It was famously applied to George W Bush after his disputed “victory”* in the 2000 US presidential election, when the cartoonist Doonesbury started portraying Bush as a literal asterisk.</p>
<p>* Bush got fewer votes than Al Gore in Florida, but still won there.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/doonesbury.jpeg" alt="gw bush in doonesbury"></p>
<p>In baseball, there's always talk of <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/06/27/roger-maris-and-the-myth-of-the-asterisk/">asterisks</a> set against players’ recorded achievements. According to the New York Times, the US Tennis Open this year (2020) should be called “The Asterisk Open”, because of the many players who couldn’t attend, and so the winner isn’t the best player.<sup id="fnref:tennis"><a href="#fndef:tennis">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another famous bearer of the insinuating asterisk is drug-peddler and bike-pedaller Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/nyt-lance-armstrong-asterisk.png" alt="lance armstrong"></p>
<p>So the word itself has picked up a bit of a smell.</p>
<h2 id="asterisk_assessment"><a href="#asterisk_assessment">Asterisk assessment</a></h2>
<p>So far, this is the history of the asterisk as told in books and web pages. Keith Hou­s­ton’s excellent book <em>Shady Characters</em> <sup id="fnref:shady"><a href="#fndef:shady">[4]</a></sup> covers the history of most of the punctuation marks in great detail. But his chapter on the asterisk concentrates entirely on the asterisk’s use as a footnote indicator, and ends more or less here.</p>
<p>Today we're used to seeing it used for many more things than footnotes, such as multiplication. In mathematics, various symbols have been used for multiplication, although the default operation is multiplication: for mathematicians, if you place two symbols in intimate contact, they’ll naturally multiply without needing any help from a third symbol.</p>
<p>The Julia language allows for implicit multiplication between numbers and variables:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt;

julia&gt; x = 2
2

julia&gt; 2x
4</code></pre>
<p>although Python doesn’t:</p>
<pre><code>% python
Python 3.8.1 (default, Mar  8 2020, 13:39:36)
[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2x
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
2x
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Most languages use <code>*</code> for multiplication. Mathematica* is more capable than most. Spaces denote multiplication, but you can also use a <code>*</code> for multiplication if you want to.</p>
<p>* probably renamed to the Wolfram Language since I last used it</p>
<p>Let's go back in time again, to see how the asterisk started this journey.</p>
<h2 id="galileo_galileo"><a href="#galileo_galileo">Galileo Galileo</a></h2>
<p>Up to the 1600s, the asterisk was used mainly for footnotes and decorative purposes in scientific books. For example, it finds its astronomical roots in the famous publication by Galileo, <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em>, the Sidereal (Starry) Message, printed in 1610.</p>
<p>These asterisks show what Galileo called the Medicean Stars, which we now call the Galilean Moons, orbiting Jupiter.*</p>
<p>* It looks like the typesetter is using the same “O” to represent Jupiter here that was used on the title page for “GalileO GalileO” and “COsmO Medici”. The asterisk ‘plot markers’ do the job perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/sidereal-messenger.png" alt="Galileo sidereal message"></p>
<h2 id="symbols"><a href="#symbols">Symbols</a></h2>
<p>Science, and mathematics, the language of science, had gradually developed from medieval manuscripts written in elaborate Latin sentences to printed books embroidered with algebraic symbols. Mathematics moved away from the wordy descriptive approach to a more algebraic style.*</p>
<p>* This always wasn’t an unopposed process. It's been called “The struggle between symbolists and rhetoricians”. <sup id="fnref:Florian"><a href="#fndef:Florian">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the 1500s on, various authors enthusiastically promoted new syntax and probably hoped that their favourite symbols would take hold and become standard. No doubt the printers of mathematical books were happy to add the cost of designing, punch-cutting, and hot-lead-moulding all those extra new pieces of type to the final invoice.*</p>
<p>* Perhaps these days it’s not that much easier to add new symbols to a font.</p>
<p>In 1668, the Swiss author Johan Heinrich Rahn was the first to introduce the asterisk to indicate multiplication, in his algebraic treatise <em>Teutsche Algebra</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/rahn-multiply.png" alt="rahn"></p>
<p>That spiral character denotes ‘involution’ (an old word for exponentiation). His book also contains, on another page, the first printed use of the division symbol ÷.</p>
<p>Until recently, Rahn’s score had been: won 1, lost 1. The multiplying asterisk didn’t catch on at all at the time, although his division sign did.</p>
<h3 id="the_saltire"><a href="#the_saltire">The saltire</a></h3>
<p>Earlier, in 1631, William Oughtred<sup id="fnref:Oughtred"><a href="#fndef:Oughtred">[6]</a></sup>* had published the <em>Clavis Mathematicae, The Key to Mathematics</em>, and this famous textbook, with its profusion of new symbols, was very influential and studied by many, including the young Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>* 1574 – 1660 • He was a clergyman, mathematician, teacher, inventor - he taught Christopher Wren, among others. He invented the slide rule and introduced the abbreviations “sin” and “cos” for the sine and cosine functions.</p>
<p>Oughtred’s book popularized the saltire, a rotated plus sign, for use as the visible multiplication symbol. Here’s the first time it appeared in print:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/oughtred-clavis.png" alt="oughtred"></p>
<p>In the hands of this typesetter, it’s quite small compared with the other operators. It wouldn't easily be confused with the usually seriff-ed letter X.</p>
<p>Here's ×, the times sign (<code>\u00d7</code>), and the saltire:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-d7_2613-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>* The saltire also goes by the name St Andrew’s Cross - who was crucified on a larger wooden version. In heraldry, it’s formed by ‘a bend and a bend sinister’.</p>
<p>Sadly, × doesn’t work as a multiplication sign in Julia, although it’s easy enough to make it work:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; const × = *
* (generic function with 385 methods)

julia&gt; x = 3 × 4
12

julia&gt; a = "hello" × "world" # ⁉
"helloworld"</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if there are any unexpected side effects when doing this.</p>
<h2 id="leibniz"><a href="#leibniz">Leibniz</a></h2>
<p>The influential mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz didn’t like Oughtred’s saltire symbol, and wrote to Bernoulli in 1698:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not like the <code>×</code> symbol as a symbol for multiplication, since it is easily confounded with <code>x</code>;&nbsp;… often I simply&nbsp;relate two quantities by an interposed dot and indicate multiplication with <code>ZC ⋅ LM</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The saltire probably found more favour in England than Germany. Newton adopted it, doubtless after seeing a need for it. Here’s the first edition of his Principia Mathematica<sup id="fnref:principia"><a href="#fndef:principia">[7]</a></sup>, published in 1687.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/newton-principia-first.png" alt="newton principia first edition"></p>
<p>I’d say Leibniz definitely has a ‘point’ here, because Newton's used a lowercase <code>x</code> as a surrogate saltire, although to be fair he doesn't often use <code>x</code> as a variable. But in the revised 1723 edition, Newton improves most of his font choices*:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/newton-principia-third.png" alt="newton principia third edition"></p>
<p>* That letter Q is eye-catching.</p>
<p>Now the saltire is much larger and, without the serifs used for most mathematical printing at the time, is less likely to be confused with an X of any size.</p>
<p>More so than Oughtred and Rahn, Leibniz was very influential: he popularized the dx/dy notation, the integration symbol, the multiplication dot, signs for congruence and similarity, and many more, and even used an asterisk for the occasional multiplication.</p>
<h3 id="too_useful"><a href="#too_useful">Too useful</a></h3>
<p>In general, though, the multiplying asterisk wasn’t often used in most mathematics (as opposed to arithmetical) texts, and was more likely to be used to indicate footnotes or for other more specialized uses. If multiplication was required, Leibniz’ dot was considered …</p></div></div>

Changes have been made to enhance usability - see the <i>Who we are</i> section for more detail. Any major changes are noted on the game's page. </p>
	  
          <h2>Thanks</h2>
          <p>In addition to the people who worked on the archive and the website, we would like to give a big <strong>thank you</strong> to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MattGodbolt">Matt Godbolt</a> for developing <a href="http://bbc.godbolt.org/">jsbeeb</a>, and sharing it with the world on <a href="https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb">github</a>. It makes the website come alive - anyone can play the BBC Micro games right in the browser!</p>

           <h2>Who we are</h2><p>
The games on this website, almost without exception, were originally curated by Mick Brown, who announced the "30th Anniversary BBC &amp; Electron Collection" in 2014 and started <a href="http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=8270">releasing disc images on the Stardot forum</a> in May of that year. 
</p><p>
The collection is made up of games that Mick had first copied to his own "unofficial" compilation discs thirty years before. 
</p><p>
Mick has enhanced the games by adding user-friendly instructions (taken from cassette inlays or other authentic sources) and ensuring that the games are compatible with a range of emulators as well as real Acorn hardware.
</p><p>
Our thanks go to Mick for the countless hours of work he has put into compiling, enhancing, testing, and re-testing the games in this collection.
</p><p>
Thanks also to Paul Houghton for developing the <a href="http://bbcmicro.co.uk//bbcmicro.co.uk">bbcmicro.co.uk</a> website, and to Gary for hosting it.
</p><p>
Lee "Eagle Eyes" Newsome proofread the game instructions, tested every game several times, and coordinated the work on the website project.
Huge thanks to Dave Moore (user Arcadian on Stardot) for his enduring commitment to preserving and promoting all things Acorn, online and off, including the creation of the invaluable <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/">Stairway To Hell</a> archive. 
</p><p>
We're grateful to the incredibly knowledgeable members of the Stardot forum for their generous help and support.
</p>

<p>Two months ago, I wrote a tutorial that explains how to get DRM support on Chromium on the Raspberry Pi.

How is the video playback quality in Chromium? Do you know if it uses hardware acceleration or just the CPU?</p></blockquote><p>Last week I had some time to run some tests and extended the tutorial to add support for hardware acceleration for the video decoding.</p><p>To answer that question, the video playback quality is good, however, per default Chromium uses Software (CPU) to decode the video. This means, no hardware acceleration.</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/3bf/6a9/0f8/5f2ee61e14113689348494__655.jpg" width="400px" alt="Graphics Feature Status - Software Acceleration" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/3bf/6a9/0f8/5f2ee61e14113689348494__655.jpg 655w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/3bf/6a9/0f8/5f2ee61e14113689348494__400.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/3bf/6a9/0f8/5f2ee61e14113689348494__655.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/3bf/6a9/0f8/5f2ee61e14113689348494__655.jpg 655w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/3bf/6a9/0f8/5f2ee61e14113689348494__400.jpg 400w"><br><span>Fig. 3: Graphics Feature Status - Chromium on Raspberry Pi 4.</span></p></div><p>But, we will change that on this tutorial!</p><h2><span id="hardware-and-software-297543">Hardware and Software</span></h2><p>You will need the following hardware and software for this tutorial:</p><h2><span id="diy-video-decode-using-hardware-acceleration-297543">DIY: Video Decode using Hardware Acceleration</span></h2><p>You need to install a few libraries, but first, the basic step is to update the system typing the following on a Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade</code></pre>
<p>Then, install the libraries typing:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa libgles2-mesa-dev xorg-dev</code></pre>
<p>To be able to activate the hardware acceleration, first we need to enable the 3D video driver (so-called Fake KMS), and then set the memory to e.g. <code>128 MB</code> (this is usually a default value).
To do that:</p><ol><li>Start the <code>raspi-config</code> configurator, typing in a Terminal:
<pre><code>sudo raspi-config</code></pre></li><li>Go to <code>Advanced Options</code> &gt; <code>GL Driver</code></li><li>Select the option <code>GL (Fake KMS) OpenGL desktop driver with fake KMS</code> and Click OK</li><li>Go to <code>Advanced Options</code> &gt; <code>Memory Split</code></li><li>Type <code>128</code> and click OK</li><li>Select Finish and Reboot the system.</li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you're new to this configurator, you can navigate the menu using the <code>arrows</code> and the <code>tab</code> key from your keyboard.</p><p>Once your Raspberry reboots, you can check that the 3D drivers are loaded and working:</p>
<pre><code>cat /proc/device-tree/soc/firmwarekms@7e600000/status
cat /proc/device-tree/v3dbus/v3d@7ec04000/status</code></pre>

        <p>After having just dropped out of university, at 19-years-old; I received a line of advice that <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/books">changed my life</a>.</p>
<div><p>On one unforgettable evening, I got to attend a meal that sat some of the world’s leading experts on food health and safety. Each of them had flown in from different parts of the world, as they gathered for a board meeting for the scientific journal my father founded. During the dinner, one member of the board, <em>Dr. Joseph Jen</em> (who oversaw four agencies of the <em>U.S. Department of Agriculture</em> during the Bush administration) turned to me and asked what I was up to. Despite his self-assured nature and intimidating presence,  I took the opportunity to honestly inform him that I had just left university upon feeling unchallenged and that I was looking to satisfy my ambitions somehow. I then asked him for his advice as to what to do about the matter.</p><p>
&nbsp;
This is when he uttered the line. The line that would stick with me for years to come. The line that would help focus my efforts as I revisited it time and time again before contemplating a career shift or life decision.&nbsp;</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Think of your career as a toolbox: your job is to fill it with as many tools as possible.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years have gone by and <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/now">you can now find me</a> overseeing the product development, user experience design, and culture for an app company as their VP of Product. How did I end up here? Besides the usual variables outside of my control, like luck; it was in fact my adoption of the Toolbox Strategy that Dr. Jen gave me that one evening in 2016, that uniquely positioned me as a tremendously valuable asset for the job marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, I had worked from the preconceived notion that in order to be any good at something, and thus valuable to the job market, you would need to be a <strong>specialist</strong> at that very thing. This was a great cause of anxiety for me during my first few days at university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course I was about to begin studying was <em>Information and Interface Design (BA)</em>. What I had discovered early on, was that all of my coursemates had some classical, academic training in either graphic design or art. Some students had even completed an art foundation year beforehand on the recommendation of the course leader. Meanwhile, there I was, fresh out of school, with no relevant qualifications to hand, having previously studied philosophy, ethics, and English. And in my mind, my lack of a pertinent academic background marked me as <em>doomed</em>. From the very first moment, I felt completely behind. I feared that I would never become a great designer.</p>
<p>But by comparing myself with my coursemates with <em>specialism</em> in mind, I was starting on the wrong foot. I could only see the value that an individual brought to the table through a narrow lens. Over time, however, I began to look at my value in a different manner. With each project, there was a presentation. And with each presentation, I started to see that my mismatch of previous academic experience was giving me a slight edge: for all the research work I did to study different cultures and backgrounds in my ethics class, allowed me to better understand the needs of people I was designing for. All the deep thinking that I did in philosophy made me consider more options as I chose which creative solution I would design. And all the extensive writing I did in English essays, gave me the tools to tell more engaging stories and better explain my process for how I came to my design solutions. These skills didn’t make me a better designer, but the combination of such skills served me in a way that put me paces ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, by the end of the year, I was beginning to grasp the underpinnings of the very strategy that Dr Jen would later give me the words for. I was widening my lens. Readjusting my focus. Discovering how the combination of unrelated past experiences was actually serving me this entire time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was adopting the <strong>Toolbox Strategy</strong>. Where your career is a toolbox; and your life is a constant pursuit of various skills and areas of knowledge to fill it with. Then, in order to equip yourself with rare insights, you simply cross-reference your learnings from the pursuit of each tool. Thus making you: uniquely valuable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professor of Brand Strategy at NYU, <a href="https://amzn.to/2S1cV6d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scott Galloway</a>, advises that in order to be remarkable, you must <em>“develop not just one area of expertise, but two skills that don’t naturally go together.”</em> Galloway compares young careerists to Lindt Chocolate and their ability to bring dark chocolate and chilli peppers together to create something uniquely valuable, as he asks: “what two attributes are you going to bring together that differentiates you?</p>

    <blockquote>Develop not just one area of expertise, but two skills that don’t naturally go together - @profgalloway</blockquote>

</div>
<p>Likewise, after consulting with <a href="https://justincampbellplatt.com/thankful-list">a great mentor of mine</a> on a long afternoon walk; he advised me that if I were to be ambitious about anything in my career, it should be to develop what he called: <em>“4 pillars of understanding”</em>. That I should master the practices of four seemingly separate fields to build an amalgamation of ideas that no one else could possess. My mentor of course walked-the-walk before giving such advice as he built a successful business on the back of his specific knowledge in Maths, Computer Science, Economics, and Psychology.</p>
<p>For years, I believed being valuable required creating the largest possible <em>circle of competence</em>. But what I have realised, is that by adopting the Toolbox Strategy, each skill and area of knowledge that you acquire gives you another circle. The unique value that you can then offer the marketplace is clear. It is, in fact, derived not from the circles themselves, but rather from the Venn diagrams you create as the perimeters of your circles’ overlap.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So how do I best acquire my&nbsp;tools?</h2>
<p><strong>Work in a startup.</strong> This is as prescriptive as my advice can get. And whilst I’m sure there are other ways in which you can develop more than one skill at a time - there is simply no better place in the working world for someone who wants to acquire an abundance of tools for their toolbox. Join one early enough and wearing multiple hats will be the very nature of your job. One day you’ll be designing user flows, another day you’ll be managing product development, and in another, you’ll be figuring out how to better market your product. At a startup, not only will your range of skills acquired be large, but your rate of learning each skill will be rapid. You will learn things by the end of the week that you will wish you had known at the beginning of it.</p>
<p><strong>Seek out uncomfortable jobs.</strong> As a designer, it can be tempting to join a company that already has design rooted in their culture. Being the, even the eighth, junior experience designer at Airbnb does seem tremendously exciting and sexy. Thinking about having so many of your colleagues validating your seat at the table is delightful for any creative. In contrast, the thought of joining a company that has never recognised the ROI of design or simply considers it to be a process to make things ‘look nice’ may be completely uninspiring. Thinking about how much you’re going to have to fight for your existence can seem exhausting for prospective creatives.</p>
<p>But be warned. If you take the former job, whilst you’ll leave with an impressive company to flaunt on your CV, you will lack the skills to match the expectation that future employers will have of you. Since you didn’t do the work that made Airbnb known for design in the first place, you will struggle to create any of the impact required from you in the role to justify the pay or title.</p>
<p>For designers, the companies that seem least interested or knowledgable in your field are usually the very best to work for. <em>High risk, high reward.</em> And for anyone else, become the marketer that takes a company from zero-to-one, rather than the tenth marketer who optimises funnels for an already well-known brand and your job will grant you tremendous insight into the very skills that actually help build products, strategies, and companies.</p>
<p><strong>Be okay with not having a linear career.</strong> Your goal is to align yourself with learning a range of skills, not with having a slowly progressing series of job titles. As you acquire your range of skills you will find yourself doing different things for very different people. You will be an <em>Associate Customer Success Manager</em> in one company, <em>Junior Marketer</em> in the next, only to find yourself as <em>Head of Product</em> in following. Rather than seeking validation in climbing some invisible ladder that ultimately leads to the same work just with more responsibility and stress, find comfort in the fact that your odd-looking LinkedIn profile is an indicator that you’re likely developing an incredible range of skills.</p>
<p>The same goes for your salary too. To truly develop skills from multiple disciplines, you will be required to walk in and out of companies playing in different markets. Each company will, therefore, look at your CV with differing opinions of your value. This means that if your salary at each position you take in your early career were to be charted on a graph, your line should look less like the sensible, Apple stock price - and more like the volatile, Bitcoin price.</p>

<h2>What’s in your&nbsp;toolbox?</h2>
<p>Even now, in my role as VP of Product, I’m very much still in pursuit of tools for my toolbox. I’m constantly studying different fields: including economics, psychology, and brand strategy. I’m making use of <em>deliberate practice</em> to develop new skills such as Interior Design, persuasive writing, and making life operating tools in Notion. It’s not entirely clear to me yet how each of these tools will overlap. Or even if they will …</p></div></div>

<p><em>tldr: work has started to make <a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a> work as a backend in curl for HTTP.</em></p>



<p>curl and its data transfer core, libcurl, is all written in C. The language C is known and infamous for not being memory safe and for being easy to mess up and as a result accidentally cause security problems.</p>



<p>At the same time, C compilers are very widely used and available and you can compile C programs for virtually every operating system and CPU out there. A C program can be made far more portable than code written in just about any other programming language.</p>



<p>curl is a piece of “insecure” C code installed in some ten billion installations world-wide. I’m saying insecure within quotes because I don’t think curl is insecure. We have our share of security vulnerabilities of course, even if I think the rate of them getting found has been drastically reduced over the last few years, but we have never had a critical one and with the help of busloads of tools and humans we find and fix most issues in the code before they ever land in the hands of users. (And “memory safety” is not the single explanation for getting security issues.)</p>



<p>I believe that curl and libcurl will remain in wide use for a long time ahead: curl is an established component and companion in scripts and setups everywhere. libcurl is almost a de facto standard in places for doing internet transfers.</p>



<p>A rewrite of curl to another language is not considered. Porting an old, established and well-used code base such as libcurl, which to a far degree has gained its popularity and spread due to a stable API, not breaking the ABI and not changing behavior of existing functionality, is a massive and daunting task. To the degree that so far it hasn’t been attempted seriously and even giant corporations who have considered it, have <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/" data-type="post" data-id="12576">backpedaled such ideas</a>.</p>



<h2>Change, but not change</h2>



<p>This preface above might make it seem like we’re stuck with exactly what we have for as long as curl and libcurl are used. But fear not: things are more complicated, or perhaps brighter, than it first seems.</p>



<p>What’s important to users of libcurl needs to be kept intact. We keep the API, the ABI, the behavior and all the documented options and features remain. We also need to continuously add stuff and keep up with the world going forward.</p>



<p>But we can change the internals! <em>Refactor</em> as the kids say.</p>



<h2>Backends, backends, backends</h2>



<p>Already today, you can build libcurl to use different “backends” for TLS, SSH, name resolving, LDAP, IDN, GSSAPI and HTTP/3.</p>



<p>A “backend” in this context is a piece of code in curl that lets you use a particular solution, often involving a specific third party library, for a certain libcurl functionality. Using this setup you can, for example, opt to build libcurl with one or more out of <em>thirteen</em> different TLS libraries. You simply pick the one(s) you prefer when you build it. The libcurl API remains the same to users, it’s just that some features and functionality might differ a bit. The number of TLS backends is of course also fluid over time as we add support for more libraries in the future, or even drop support for old ones as they fade away.</p>



<p>When building curl, you can right now make it use up to <strong>33</strong> different third party libraries for different functions. Many of them of course mutually exclusive, so no single build can use all 33.</p>



<p>Said differently: you can improve your curl and libcurl binaries without changing any code, by simply rebuilding it to use another backend combination.</p>

No Hyper in this map yet…</figcaption></figure>



<h2>libcurl as a glorified switch</h2>



<p>With an extensive set of backends that use third party libraries, the job of libcurl to a large extent becomes to act as a switch between the provided stable external API and the particular third party library that does the heavy lifting.</p>



<p><strong>API &lt;=&gt; glue code in C &lt;=&gt; backend library</strong></p>



<p>libcurl as the rock, with a door and the entry rules written in stone. The backends can come and go, change and improve, but the applications outside the entrance won’t notice that. They get a stable API and ABI that they know and trust.</p>



<h2>Safe backends</h2>



<p>This setup provides a foundation and infrastructure to offer backends written in other languages as part of the package. As long as those libraries have APIs that are accessible to libcurl, libraries used by the backends can be written in any language – but since we’re talking about memory safety in this blog post the most obvious choices would probably be one of the modern and safe languages. For example <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png" alt="" width="204" height="204" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png 500w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px"></a></figure></div>



<p>With a backend library written in Rust , libcurl would lean on such a component to do low level protocol work and presumably, by doing this it increases the chances of the implementations to be safe and secure.</p>



<p>Two of the already supported third party libraries in the world map image above are written in Rust: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche">quiche</a> and <a href="https://mesalink.io/">Mesalink</a>.</p>



<h2>Hyper as a backend for HTTP</h2>



<p><a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a> is a HTTP library written in Rust. It is meant to be fast, accurate and safe, and it supports both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png 640w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></figure></div>



<p>As another step into this world of an ever-growing number of backends to libcurl, work has begun to make sure curl (<em>optionally</em>) can get built to use Hyper.</p>



<p>This work is gracefully funded by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">ISRG</a>, perhaps mostly known as the organization behind <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. Thanks!</p>



<h2>Many challenges remain</h2>



<p>I want to emphasize that this is early days. We know what we want to do, we know basically how to do it but from there to actually getting it done and providing it in source code to the world is <em>a little bit of work</em> that hasn’t been done. I’m set out to do it.</p>



<p>Hyper didn’t have a C API, they’re <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2278">working on making one</a> so that C based applications such as curl can actually use it. I do my best at providing feedback from my point of view, but as I’m not really into Rust much I can’t assist much with the implementation parts there.</p>



<p>Once there’s an early/alpha version of the API to try out, I will first make sure curl can get built to use Hyper, and then start poking on the code to start using it.</p>



<p>In that work I expect me to have to go back to the API with questions, feedback and perhaps documentation suggestions. I also anticipate challenges in switching libcurl internals to using this. Mostly small ones, but possibly also larger ones.</p>



<p>I have created a git branch and make my work on this public and accessible early on to let everyone who wants to, to keep up with the development. A first milestone will be the ability to run a single curl test case (any test case) successfully – unmodified. The branch is here: <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper">https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper</a> – beware that it will be rebased frequently.</p>



<p>There’s no deadline for this project and I don’t yet have any guesses as when there will be anything to test.</p>



<h2>Rust itself is not there yet</h2>



<p>This project is truly ground work for future developers to build upon as some of the issues dealt with in here should benefit others as well down the road. For example it immediately became obvious that Rust in general encourages to <em>abort</em> on out-of-memory issues, while this is a big <em>nono</em> when the code is used in a system library (such as curl).</p>



<p>I’m a bit vague on the details here because it’s not my expertise, but Rust itself <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2265#issuecomment-696915382">can’t even properly clean up its memory</a> and just returns error when it hits such a condition. Clearly something to fix before a libcurl with hyper could claim identical behavior and never to leak memory.</p>



<h2>By default?</h2>



<p>Will Hyper be used by default in a future curl build near you?</p>



<p>We’re going to work on the project to make that future <em>a possibility</em> with the mindset that it could benefit users.</p>



<p><strong>If</strong> it truly happens involve many different factors (for example maturity, feature set, memory footprint, performance, portability and on-disk footprint…) and in particular it will depend a lot on the people that build and ship the curl packages you use – which isn’t the curl project itself as we only ship source code. I’m thinking of Linux and operating system distributions etc.</p>



<p><strong>When </strong>it might happen we can’t tell yet as we’re still much too early in this process.</p>



<h2>Still a lot of C</h2>



<p>This is not converting curl to Rust.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t be fooled into believing that we are getting rid of C in curl by taking this step.</strong> With the introduction of a Hyper powered backend, we will certainly reduce the share of C code that is executed in a typical HTTP transfer by a measurable amount (for those builds), but curl is much more than that.</p>



<p>It’s not even a given that the Hyper backend will “win” the competition for users against the C implementation on the platforms you care about. The future is not set.</p>



<h2>More backends in safe languages?</h2>



<p>Sure, why not? There are efforts to provide more backends written in Rust. Gradually, we might move into a future where less and less of the final curl and libcurl executable code was compiled from C.</p>



<p>How and if that will happen will of course depend on a lot of factors – in particular funding of the necessary work.</p>



<p>Can we drive the development in this direction even further? I think it is much too early to speculate on that. Let’s first see how these first few episodes into the coming decades turn out.</p>

<h5>2018-02-15 - By Robert Elder</h5>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is to discuss the works of computer programmer Jim Roskind. &nbsp;Specifically, his work related to the C/C++ programming languages will be emphasized. &nbsp;I became motivated to do this short write-up when I realized that a lot of his work on C/C++ programming was done in the 1990-1996 era, just after digital communication formats became popular, but just before 'blog' type documentation format became popular. &nbsp;As a result, a number of references to his works are becoming dead links, or are simply lacking any context somewhere in a decaying ftp site that nobody knows about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is unlikely to be interesting to anyone with a casual interest in C programming, but it is instead intended for individuals looking to develop an extremely intimate understanding of the C/C++ programming languages and their histories. &nbsp;My interest in reviewing Roskind's work has been to look for compiler test cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I'll discuss a bit about the man himself:  &nbsp;As far as I can tell in my Googling, and assuming that I haven't confused multiple people with the same name, he was an independent consultant around 1990[1], was a co-founder of Infoseek Corporation[2][3] in 1994, joined Netscape in 1995[2], appeared in the popular documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m52s">Project Code Rush</a> around 1998, joined Google in 2008 and designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> in 2012. &nbsp;He has a number of other technical accomplishments that I haven't listed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of contributions to C programming, here are a couple files from around 1990 that are particularly worth mentioning:</p>

<p><code><pre>c++grammar1.1.tar.Z
c++grammar2.0.tar.Z
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you're reading this in the future and various links to these files may no longer be working, below are various hashes of these files. &nbsp;If you are lucky, searching for them might hopefully lead you to a mirror somewhere (at the moment they don't). &nbsp;I also checked for different sources of these files, and although I can find lots of references, I could only find a single mirror where I could download them:</p>

<p><code><pre>md5     5c5e10f21f7f77dba73f2fff792eb5d4  c++grammar1.1.tar.Z

</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after checking the license of these files, I think it should be fine to mirror them myself too:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/assets/c%2B%2Bgrammar1.1.tar.Z">c++grammar1.1.tar.Z</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/assets/c%2B%2Bgrammar2.0.tar.Z">c++grammar2.0.tar.Z</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The c++grammar1.1.tar.Z document appears to simply be an earlier version of the c++grammar2.0.tar.Z version. &nbsp;Inside the c++grammar2.0.tar.Z version, you will find the following files (according to freegrm5.txt):</p>

<ul>
<li>FREEGRM5.TXT - This introductory file</li>
<li>GRAMMAR5.TXT - Parsing ambiguities in C++, and in my grammar</li>

<li>AUTODOC5.TXT - Documentationfor my machine generated analysis</li>
<li>Y.OUTPUT - Machine generated analysis of the C++ grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word 'my' as used in the above list should be interpreted to refer to Jim Roskind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might question what the purpose is of digging up ancient grammars for YACC now that gcc and clang have moved on from this paradigm, but for me this information is still useful. &nbsp;The detailed analysis provided by Roskind is a good source for developing compiler test cases and learning how the language evolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there were a few discussions made on comp.compilers in the early 90s by Roskind that, at first glance, might seem like any other un-noteworthy piece of commentary in technical discussion forum, but they are in fact widely cited because they are the only time anyone has ever discussed the issue. &nbsp;One that I found very useful was <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/l/c/roskind.html">Jim Roskind on C ambiguity</a>. &nbsp;The post was useful because of several very special corner cases involving typedefs that it illustrates. &nbsp;In case that link goes dead, here is another reference to the general email thread on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.compilers/gqeQy3mXqnA">Google Groups comp.compilers</a>. &nbsp;And to back up my claim about citations, that post by Roskind is cited in <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01633123/document">"A Simple, Possibly Correct LR Parser for C11", Jacques-Henri Jourdan, FranÃ§ois Pottier</a>, among a number of other places.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you end up browsing the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack">The Lexer Hack</a>, you might notice that the first reference in the article is a source of Jim Roskind. &nbsp;Unfortunately, as of today, the reference is a dead link! &nbsp;But if you pay attention, you'll note that the link references a file called 'grammar5.txt' with a date of 1991-07-11, and this is exactly the date inside the 'grammar5.txt' that you can find in the tar file mentioned above!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure, but I believe the actual use of the term 'lexer hack' might actually be a reference specifically to <em>Jim Roskind's</em> lexer hack. &nbsp;Inside of grammar5.txt, there is a note: &nbsp;"I will refer to this feedback loop (from the parser that stores information in  a  symbol  table,  wherein  the lexer extracts the information) as the "lex hack"." &nbsp;That sounds to me like he came up with the term first!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if it piques your interest, here is the table of contents listed in grammar5.txt:</p>

<p>Sometime in 2010 or 2011, José Javier Mena Mustelier’s friends invited him to join a <em>Defense of the Ancients </em>battle in eastern Havana. His <em>compadres</em> recalled a sort of LAN party, at which young people gathered on a local network to play pirated video games together. At the time, getting an internet connection in Cuba looked like a distant dream. The United States’ economic embargo had made it nearly impossible to find routers and other equipment, while the government kept a close watch on the circulation of information. Cables scattered throughout buildings created small, hyperlocal intranets. But they rarely went beyond the neighborhood. Mustelier joined his friend, but the game suffered delays as contestants struggled to stay connected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back then, a Cuban citizen could legally buy a computer but not network equipment. Internet service was <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/cuba/freedom-net/2019">expensive and slow</a>; only around 16% of the island’s population <a href="https://pt.slideshare.net/DataReportal/digital-2018-cuba-january-2018">had access to the web</a> in 2011. (Nowadays, monthly use of even the slowest private Wi-Fi connection comes to 120 convertible Cuban pesos a month, nearly four times the <a href="http://www.onei.gob.cu/sites/default/files/salario_medio_2019_completa.pdf">average Cuban salary.</a>) As a response, in 2011, a group of more than 100 Havana residents decided to unify their hyperlocal networks into a larger structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Havana “street network” (or SNET) would soon become one of the largest such community networks in the world. At its peak, user estimates hovered around 100,000 IP addresses. Isolated from the internet and beyond the government’s control, young Cubans set their own terms on forums, social media platforms, and local websites. During the network’s decade-long golden era, it offered a rare example of citizen and community exchange in a country where the state carefully controls communication, until the state finally took it over. To many users, SNET’s amateur, volunteer intranet provided a better service than the network the Cuban government ultimately replaced it with.</p>



<p>Mustelier was part of this effort to bring&nbsp;together groups of computers that were already connected from the beginning. This meant gathering necessary hardware, like longer cables and better routers and servers. To acquire it, SNET’s founders relied on <a href="https://www.revolico.com/">Revolico</a>, Cuba’s version of Craigslist, which runs&nbsp;classified ads on- and offline, as well as on friends and family who traveled abroad. The group would then link the small neighborhood networks, set up servers, and tinker with the equipment.</p>



<p>Yenier Medina Chávez, another SNET founding member, told <em>Rest of World </em>that they “used $60 equipment for something that would require a $500 machine.” Routers meant for households were made into primary links to the system; 100-meter cables connected houses. Chávez also contacted the devices’ manufacturers. “When we told them the details of what we were doing,” he recalled, “they did not believe us.”</p>



<p>SNET in time became a kind of citywide internet, one divided into neighborhoods with sites of all kinds. Some resembled social networking sites like Facebook; others offered copies of Wikipedia and video game platforms, like Steam. Members hacked popular multiplayer games, such as <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Dota</em>, and ran them on SNET. Artists would release their latest works there, and cinephiles could stream their movies of choice. Users would contribute monthly to a tip jar to cover the costs.</p>

<p>Workarounds of this sort have a long-standing tradition in Cuba. Since most can’t afford streaming, they rely instead, for example, on external hard drives called <em>paquetes semanales </em>(“weekly packages”), on which television shows, albums, and offline versions of entire sites are available for download.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Administrators describe SNET as an attempt to “connect the Cuban family.” It came at very low cost to users, while also offering a glimpse of what was available outside the island.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This access was limited. Websites for international publications were unreachable, unless someone hosted articles on a connected server. SNET’s moderators would often curate information for thematic forums and sites. To avoid government interference, users were obliged to obey strict ground rules. They were not to discuss religion, politics, or topics that could “destabilize” the Cuban state — including news and controversial public posts. Viewing pornography, posting insults, or attempting to connect SNET to the World Wide Web could lead to a temporary or permanent ban.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ensuring compliance with these rules required hundreds of volunteers, including software developers and gaming enthusiasts. Volunteers were tasked with tracking down users who harassed or leaked private photos of other members. They sometimes took extreme measures, like infecting a harasser’s computer with viruses or even attempting to delete their files from hard drives remotely.</p>



<p>The street network felt homemade and small-scale. Although users could choose to be anonymous, they depended on their neighbors to connect their computers physically to the network as well as on local administrators to restore access, in case they lost their passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SNET was an open secret in Havana, its routers visible on the city’s avenues. In 2016, the state-run news site<em> Cubadebate </em>launched its technology section with <a href="http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2016/09/16/snet-la-primera-comunidad-inalambrica-en-cuba-fotos-infografia-y-pdf/">an article about it</a>, which members <a href="https://pt-br.facebook.com/SNET.Cuba/posts/1132667190135498?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAJJvwRjjeH_GPs3IeObLSARM05NAXlNF5440T_hAuNylByNSo1cOXFc8PpYN3Gn1zfSgU0_ExfjHB9LV5ZES55RI4IaOM17ioi5fC3WakBkFnfreRBhDYSk6yFhsIbdmYgHKRuMlpOOKf8U3nYO_RUXUQKEQn5HhtjkFDVCV6w7b1csvKdfQ02Hhz6ShEepkSqSLTZdChLEyhkqrITBWDeHdhUu4CbG8J5MtjbyU0eBOYWwYabbf13MuLzuarcQcVT6JRtEevq8C91YcImP6sHFlnqOkldswNSMSWrEXJb6DLsvFgU14bgd5kHO2e91B2Z6KqmFfKNHiXjnqnaPEhJqlqd4rAdvg&amp;__tn__=-R">took as a sign</a> the government knew of their endeavors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the country’s growing access to the internet proved detrimental to SNET. In 2015, the state-run telecommunications giant ETECSA expanded its public Wi-Fi hot spots. Three years later, it provided nationwide 3G mobile internet. In mid-2019, the ministry of communications authorized private wired and wireless connections for local businesses and individuals; 63% of Cubans <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2020-cuba">can now connect</a> to the web, joining platforms like Facebook and Instagram as well as <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/pt/top-websites/cuba/">Cuban </a>sites (which are more affordable to access).&nbsp;</p>



<p>New laws restrict community-run networks, requiring each constituent to be registered, sanctioned, and overseen. As a result, Cuba’s network has lost its homemade feel and become a state-run institution, where decisions have little to do with LAN parties and <em>compadres</em>. Coming up with new sites, launching a tool for beta testing, and moderating forums have become complex bureaucratic processes. Authorities had promised to deliver a revamped nationwide intranet, previously only accessible at public computer centers. But to do so, they needed SNET; members were forced to donate their own equipment in order to expand the state-approved intranet into people’s homes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit, and the computer centers closed down, <a href="http://www.cuba.cu/ciencia-y-tecnologia/2020-04-08/mas-de-18-mil-usuarios-acceden-desde-sus-casas-a-la-red-de-joven-club-en-medio-de-la-covid-19/51303">18,000 users could still access </a>the new national network from home, including state-approved <a href="http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2020/07/23/joven-club-lanza-tres-videojuegos-para-divertirse-y-aprender-en-el-verano-videos/#.XzKfsChKjIV">games, like Fighting Covid-19</a>, and educational content. But the state-run site remains faulty. Parts of the original platforms have not migrated to official servers — instead languishing in the neighborhoods where they were conceived, as divided as they were before SNET. Former members regret the loss of their network: “In a way, the state was the big winner,” said Mustelier.</p>

<p>This week, we continue our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, IVa, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week, we looked at how a blacksmith reshapes our iron from a spongy mass called a bloom first into a more workable shape and then finally into some final useful object like a tool.  But as we noted last week, the blacksmith doesn’t just need to manage the shape of the iron, but also its hardness and ductility.</p>



<p>As we’ll see this week, those factors – hardness and ductility (and a bunch of other more complex characteristics of metals which we’re going to leave out for simplicity’s sake) – can be manipulated by changing the chemical composition of the metal itself by <em>alloying</em> the iron with another element, carbon.  And because writing this post has run long and time has run short, <em>next</em> week, we’ll finish up by looking at how those same factors also respond to mechanical effects (work hardening) and heat treatment.</p>

And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>





<h2>What Is Steel?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the absolute basics: <em>what is steel</em>?  Fundamentally, <strong>steel is an alloy of iron and carbon</strong>.  We can, for the most part, dispense with many modern varieties of steel that involve more complex alloys; things like stainless steel (which add chromium to the mix) were unknown to pre-modern smiths and produced only by accident.  Natural alloys of this sort (particularly with manganese) might have been produced by accident where local ores had trace amounts of other metals.  This may have led to the common belief among ancient and medieval writers that iron from certain areas was superior to others (steel from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum">Noricum </a>in the Roman period, for instance, had this reputation, note Buchwald, <em>op. cit.</em> for the evidence of this), though I have not seen this proved with chemical studies.</p>



<p>So we are going to limit ourselves here to just carbon and iron.  Now in video-game logic, that means you take one ‘unit’ of carbon and one ‘unit’ of iron and bash them together in a fire to make steel.  As we’ll see, the process is at least moderately more complicated than that.  But more to the point: <strong>those proportions are totally wrong</strong>.  Steel is a combination of iron and carbon, <em>but not equal parts or anything close to it</em>.  Instead, the general division goes this way (there are several classification systems but they all have the same general grades):</p>



<p>Below 0.05% carbon or so, we just refer to that as iron.  There is going to be some small amount of carbon in most iron objects, picked up in the smelting or forging process.<br>From 0.05% carbon to 0.25% carbon is mild or low carbon steel.<br>From about 0.3% to about 0.6%, we might call medium carbon steel, although I see this classification only infrequently.<br>From <strong>0.6% to around 1.25%</strong> carbon is <em>high-carbon steel</em>, also known as <strong>spring steel</strong>.  For most armor, weapons and tools, this is the ‘good stuff’ (but see below on pattern welding).<br>From <strong>1.25% to 2%</strong> are ‘ultra-high-carbon steels’ which, as far as I can tell didn’t see much use in the ancient or medieval world.<br><strong>Above 2%</strong>, you have <strong>cast iron</strong> or <strong>pig iron</strong>; excessive carbon makes the steel much too hard and brittle, making it unsuitable for most purposes.</p>

Cast iron production was discovered much earlier in China than in most of the rest of the world, but cast iron products were brittle and not generally suitable for demanding use.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I don’t want to get too bogged down in the exact chemistry of how the introduction of carbon changes the metallic matrix of the iron; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel#Properties">you are welcome to read about it</a>.  <strong>As the carbon content of the iron increases, the iron’s basic characteristics – it’s ductility and hardness (among others) – changes</strong>.  Pure iron, when it takes a heavy impact, tends to deform (bend) to absorb that impact (it is ductile and soft).  Increasing the carbon-content makes the iron harder, causing it to both resist bending more and also to hold an edge better (hardness is the key characteristic for holding an edge through use).  In the right amount, the steel is springy, bending to absorb impacts but rapidly returning to its original shape.  But <em>too much</em> carbon and the steel becomes <em>too</em> hard and not ductile enough, causing it to become brittle.</p>



<p>Compared to the other materials available for tools and weapons, high carbon ‘spring steel’ was essentially the super-material of the pre-modern world.  High carbon steel is <em>dramatically</em> harder than iron, such that a good steel blade will bite – often surprisingly deeply – into an iron blade without much damage to itself.  Moreover, good steel can take fairly high energy impacts and simply bend to absorb the energy before springing back into its original shape (rather than, as with iron, having <em>plastic</em> deformation, where it bends, but doesn’t bend back – which is still better than <em>breaking</em>, but not much).  And for armor, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/04/collections-archery-distance-and-kiting/">you may recall from our previous</a> look at arrow penetration, a steel plate’s ability to resist puncture is <em>much</em> higher than the same plate made of iron (bronze, by the by, performs about as well as iron, assuming both are work hardened).  of course, different applications still prefer different carbon contents; armor, for instance, tended to benefit from somewhat lower carbon content than a sword blade.</p>



<p>It is sometimes contended that the ancients did not know the difference between iron and steel.  This is mostly a philological argument based on the infrequency of a technical distinction between the two in ancient languages.  Latin authors will frequently use <em>ferrum</em> (iron) to mean both iron and steel; Greek will use <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%2Fdhros&amp;highlight=iron">σίδηρος </a>(sideros, “iron”) much the same way.  The problem here is that high literature in the ancient world – which is almost all of the literature we have – has a strong aversion to technical terms <em>in general</em>; it would do no good for an elite writer to display knowledge more becoming to a tradesman than a senator.  That said in a handful of spots, Latin authors use <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dchalybs1&amp;highlight=steel"><em>chalybs</em> </a>(from the Greek χάλυψ) to mean steel, as distinct from iron.</p>



<p>More to the point, while our elite authors – who are, at most dilettantish observers of metallurgy, never active participants – may or may not know the difference,<strong> ancient artisans clearly did</strong>.  As Tylecote (<em>op. cit.</em>) notes, we see surface carburization on tools as clearly as 1000 B.C. in the Levant and Egypt, although the extent of its use and intentionality is hard to gauge to due rust and damage. There is no such problem with Gallic metallurgy from at least the La Tène period (450 BCE – 50 B.C.) or Roman metallurgy from c. 200 B.C., because we see evidence of smiths quite deliberately varying carbon content over the different parts of sword-blades (more carbon in the edges, less in the core) through pattern welding, which itself can leave a tell-tale ‘streaky’ appearance to the blade (these streaks can be faked, but there’s little point in faking them if they are not already understood to signify a better weapon).  There can be little doubt that the smith who welds a steel edge to an iron core to make a sword blade understands that there is something <em>different</em> about that edge (especially since he cannot, as we can, precisely test the hardness of the two every time – he must know a method that <em>generally</em> produces harder metal and be working from that assumption; high carbon steel, properly produced, can be much harder than iron, as we’ll see).</p>

The sword itself has a mild steel core with high carbon steel edges and a thin coating of high-carbon steel along the flat.  Almost certainly the higher carbon edge was welded on to the mild steel core during manufacture, an example of a blacksmith quite intentionally using different grades of steel.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, our ancient – or even medieval – smiths do not understand the chemistry of all of this, of course.  Understanding the effects of carbuzation and how to harness that to make better tools must have been something learned through experience and experimentation, not from theoretical knowledge – a thing passed from master to apprentice, with only slight modification in each generation (though it is equally clear that techniques could move quite quickly over cultural boundaries, since smiths with an inferior technique need only imitate a superior one).</p>



<h2>Making Steel</h2>



<p>Now, in modern steel-making, the main problem is an excess of carbon.  Steel, when smelted in a blast furnace, tends to have far too much carbon.  Consequently a lot of modern iron-working is about walking the steel down to a usefully low amount of carbon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking#Modern_processes">by getting excess carbon out of it</a>.  But ancient iron-working approaches the steeling problem from exactly the opposite direction, likely beginning with something close to a pure mass of iron and having to find ways to get more carbon into that iron to produce steel.</p>



<p><strong>So how do we take our carbon and get it into our iron?</strong>  Well, the good news is that the basic principle is actually very simple: <strong>when hot, iron will absorb carbon from the environment around it, although the process is quite slow</strong> if the iron is not molten (which it never is in these processes).  There are a few stages where that can happen and thus a few different ways of making steel out of our iron.</p>



<p>The popular assumption – in part because it was the working scholarly assumption for quite some time – is that iron can be at least partially …</p></div></div>

<p><abbr>oct 8</abbr></p>
<h2>Bye-bye, Apple</h2>
<p>The days of Apple products are behind me.
I had been developing on a Macbook for over
twelve years, but now, I’ve switched to an
ever trending setup: OpenBSD on a Thinkpad.</p>

<p>The new platform is a winner. Everything is
clean, quick, and configurable. When I 
<code>ps uaxww</code>, I’m not hogging ‘gigs’ of <abbr>RAM</abbr>
just to have things up and running. There’s
no black magic that derails me at every turn.
In short, my sanity has been long restored.</p>

<h3>What I miss</h3>


<p>Nothing is better than a fast web browser.
In Mac, this ‘<abbr>OS</abbr> within the <abbr>OS</abbr>’ was 
a mean beast. It certainly ran fast, but
the Chromium package for OpenBSD isn’t all
that bad.</p>

<p>That magnet power interface was a real win
with the Apple laptops. I miss that, in 
addition to speakers that could be maxed
out to their potential.</p>

<h3>On the other hand…</h3>


<p>There’s a healthy list of things I will
forever be glad to never have to deal 
with again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Xcode</li>
<li>the omnipresent ‘Dock’ (never used it once)</li>
<li>the omnipresent ‘Finder’</li>
<li>‘.DS_Store’ files</li>
<li>black magic in the ‘Terminal.app’</li>
<li>Notifications (and its omnipresent menu hamburger icon)</li>
<li>App store</li>
<li>start-up chord</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve noticed that with every passing year, the
peripheral interface ports are dwindling. On
an older Macbook, I still had <em>some</em> options (<abbr>SD</abbr>
card reader, <abbr>USB2</abbr>, etc.). But lately, it’s out of
control.</p>

<p>On this middle-of-the-road Thinkpad, I have
an <abbr>SD</abbr> card reader,
<abbr>HDMI</abbr>, scads of <abbr>USB</abbr> ports, <abbr>RJ-45</abbr> —
I’m never going to need a dongle, or say the
word dongle, ever again now that Apple is 
out of my life.</p>

<h3>Home again</h3>


<p>My memory is pretty good. And I recall when
I got my first Mac product: it was because
there was no other decent option for
having a development laptop, but one
where Microsoft Windows wasn’t a requirement.</p>

<p>Many times I tried duct-taping a Linux
install on my various Macs, but things 
were ‘just not there.’ There was always
an issue with this or that, and it was
truly painful.</p>

<p>I think I lost the scent of the trail. 
OpenBSD works so well, I wonder how many
years I could have been using this great
<abbr>OS</abbr> outside of just the server world.</p>

<p>Of course, this setup isn’t for all. If
you’re green on the <abbr>UNIX</abbr> front, or
can’t read a manual, you’d be foolish 
to do it. For the others, it certainly
is a viable solution, to say the least.</p>

<p>I can honestly predict that I can see 
myself using this setup for twenty-five
more years. It’s like coming home to a
quiet, orderly house.</p>

<p>Open your heart to OpenBSD on Thinkpad
at your first opportunity.</p><p><svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="200 0 400 800" width="400" height="800"><rect width="400" height="800" fill="#b33a3a"></rect><polygon points="299.5 150 254.5 247 351.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m321.9 548.9l-243.8 0"></path><path d="m303 247.1l0 243.8"></path><polygon points="94.5 150 49.5 247 146.5 247 "></polygon><path d="m98 247.1l0 243.8"></path><text font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="60" y="112" x="10" style="fill-opacity:null">THIS END UP</text><a xlink:href="//cretaria.com"><text id="link-cretaria" font-family="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" font-size="50" y="680" x="10" fill-opacity="null">What’s Cretaria?</text></a><path d="m175 700l200 0" style="fill-opacity:null;fill:none;stroke-linejoin:null;stroke-opacity:null;stroke-width:4;stroke:#000"></path></svg></p></article>

The report states that, <em>“conditioning access to a product or service in which a firm has market power to the use of a separate product or service is anticompetitive.”</em></p><p>The report, which clocks in at a terrify 449 pages, investigates the issues of competition in the digital market. The report looks at companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, and yes, Facebook. The report only mentions VR a small number of times, but it does go into detail about the large acquisitions of that each company has made. This includes Facebook’s purchase of Oculus in 2014.</p><p>The report states,</p><p><em>“Facebook has also maintained and expanded its dominance through a series of acquisitions of companies it viewed as competitive threats, and selectively excluded competitors from using its platform to insulate itself from competitive pressure.</em></p><p><em>Facebook has also maintained its monopoly through a series of anticompetitive business practices. The company used its data advantage to create superior market intelligence to identify nascent competitive threats and then acquire, copy, or kill these firms. Once dominant, Facebook selectively enforced its platform policies based on whether it perceived other companies as competitive threats. In doing so, it advantaged its own services while weakening other firms.”</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/Sidequest-New-Logo-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>This has major implications for the future of the Oculus and developers, we have seen Facebook flex their considerable power over smaller developers. We have previously reported on the issues that the <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/unofficial-oculus-quest-appstore-receives-650-000-in-funding/">developer focused app store, Sidequest</a>, has had in gaining purchase in the Oculus ecosystem, not to mention the <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/vr-developers-are-concerned-about-facebooks-walled-garden/">side-lining of the VR steaming service, Bigscreen</a>, by giving favourable terms to large companies like Fandango. With Facebook offering the most affordable headset on the market, we may see even more developers become disillusioned with the Oculus ecosystem and move on to greener pastures.</p>
