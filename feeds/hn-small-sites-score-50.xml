February 9, 2021 | https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Startups and technology canâ€™t solve <em>all</em> the worldâ€™s problems, but they can solve a good amount of them. Now more than ever, we need people to build the next generation of companies that will tackle some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems. There are a lot of unknowns right now, but at Wilbur Labs, we believe this is the best time to start a company â€“ ever. </p><p>Wilbur Labs is a startup studio turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. Since 2016 we have built and invested in 15 technology companies, including <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/">VacationRenter</a>, <a href="https://www.vitabox.com/">Vitabox</a>, <a href="https://www.joblist.com/">Joblist</a>, <a href="https://www.barkbus.com/">Barkbus</a>, and more.</p><p>We plan to launch several companies every year, which requires building a solid pipeline of ambitious ideas. Over the years, we have used three primary approaches to get startup ideas: build for the future, solve existing problems better, or solve personal problems.</p></div><h2>1. Build for the Future</h2><div><div><p>The future is not static. It is built by people who have a vision for what the future should look like, and those who have the willingness to work hard and take the risks necessary to get there. A great way to get startup ideas is to sit down and think about what the future should look like. Ask yourself the following questions: </p><p><em>How are behaviors changing? Which changes will stick? </em><br><em>What long-term problems have been created as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? </em><br><em>What priorities and values have changed?</em><br><em>What are the biggest problems today?</em><br><em>What will be the biggest problems tomorrow?</em><br><em>What new problems can technology solve today?</em><br><em>How can new technology change the way existing problems are solved?</em></p></div><p>2020 is a year that consumer behaviors are changing and evolving at a faster rate than ever before. Emerging trends that would have taken 5 to 10 years to mature are instead maturing overnight. There is a large opportunity to think about changing trends and build companies ahead of the curve. eCommerce, Employment, Insurance, and Mobile On-Demand are just a few industries where we are boosting investments as a result of new long-term trends.</p><p>When thinking about the future, itâ€™s important to think and plan for the long-term. The best ideas can be built into big, sustainable businesses that can solve problems and create value over the long-term. Avoid short-termism, also known as ideas which may seem solid in the short-term but have a short expiration date.</p><p>Barkbus is a great example of a business that is building for the future. Back in 2017, the world was rapidly transitioning to direct-to-your-door services. Despite that, the way most people got their dogs groomed hadnâ€™t changed. Pet parents still went to the salon, which was a time consuming and stressful experience for both dogs and their parents. Barkbus launched to <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/announcements/why-we-acquired-barkbus">make mobile grooming the new norm</a> for pet parents and their dogs. </p></div><h2>2. Solve Existing Problems Better</h2><div><p>We believe the best companies solve real problems. These problems may be completely new problems, or they may be existing problems that have not been solved well by existing companies to date.</p><p>Do not discount existing problems when generating startup ideas. Some of the largest, most impactful companies throughout history were built by solving existing problems better than others. Google did not invent the search engine, search ads, web based email, or maps. Apple did not invent the smartphone, the tablet, or the smart watch. Facebook did not invent social networking. The list goes on and on. What these companies did is provide a better experience than the existing companies. At Wilbur Labs, we refer to this as â€œcreating a 10x experience.â€� </p><p>Next time you have an idea and someone says, â€œdoesnâ€™t X do that?â€� â€” instead of throwing away your idea, first decide if thereâ€™s an opportunity to 10x the experience. Competitors are a good sign as it means there is a real problem people care about. Challenging the status quo is a great way to solve big problems and build a large business. </p><p>When we built Joblist, we did so because despite multiple large job boards, the job search process hasnâ€™t changed in 20 years â€” when job listings first moved online. We saw an opportunity to 10x the job search experience by introducing more personalization and collaboration tools to a traditionally generic and lonely process. Job seekers have embraced this new approach, which allowed Joblist to help millions of job seekers by powering over 500,000 new applications <a href="https://www.joblist.com/news/why-we-launched-joblist">before their public launch</a>.</p></div><h2>3. Solve Personal Problems</h2><div><div><p>Many of the best startup ideas are personal problems that you have faced. What are the biggest problems that you wish were solved? How many others face the same problem? If you experience a problem, then you are uniquely positioned to solve it.</p><p>More often than not, entrepreneurship is not a way to get rich quickly. You will likely need to work harder and longer, with higher stress and more at stake than working a regular job. The journey is absolutely worth it for the right person, but itâ€™s important that you care enough about what you are working on enough to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life. This will be easier if you care deeply about the problem you are solving.</p></div>
<p>A great example of this is why we launched VacationRenter. At Wilbur Labs, we had quarterly company offsites where we book a vacation rental to work for a few days in a different city. Every time we searched for a rental, it took hours of planning and work. We found ourselves scrolling through pages of search results and jumping from site to site, trying to find the ideal place for the best price. This was a frustrating experience and we knew we could make the search for a vacation rental better for others like us â€” which is why <a href="https://www.vacationrenter.com/news/why-we-launched-vacationrenter">we launched VacationRenter</a>. If you experience a problem, it is likely that others are experiencing it too. </p>
<p>VacationRenter became the fastest growing travel startup ever, generating over $1 billion gross bookings in 2020. This milestone confirms that we werenâ€™t the only travelers who had a frustrating experience finding the perfect rental.</p></div><h2>Next Steps</h2><div><p>At Wilbur Labs, the best startup ideas check a few key boxes:</p><ul><li><strong>Solves a problem.</strong> Could your idea solve a big problem, and have a large positive impact on a significant number of people?</li><li><strong>Builds a sustainable business. </strong>Can the idea be turned into a sustainable business that creates value over the long-term?</li><li><strong>Uniquely positioned.</strong> Are you uniquely positioned to solve the problem and you want to dedicate 5 to 10 years of your life?</li></ul></div><figure><img alt="best-startup-ideas-venn-diagram" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/wl-blog/images/ideas-venn-diagram.png"></figure><div><p>No matter how good an idea is, we believe that ideas alone are worthless unless you take initiative to execute. Execution is everything. Everyone has big ideas â€” no startup ideas are truly unique. Being able to execute on those ideas is what will turn that idea into a business.</p><p>For any idea, the most important next step is thorough research where you pair your initial idea with independent and external information.

                                    <p>Most of the visual cortex studies I’ve read have been about mammalian vision. But mammals are not the only organisms with cortex, or at least tissue resembling cortex. This paper explores <em>turtle</em> visual cortex, in an area known as dCx. This dorsal region plays the role of the turtle primary vision center — as close as you can find to the homolog of human V1.</p>

<p>But unlike V1, Fournier &amp; Müller et al confirm the existing knowledge that while dCx receives direct inputs from LGN, its layout is <em>not</em> retinotopic. They expand upon this understanding by recording from both individual cells (with electrophysiological recording) and populations of cells. They show that, aside from some slight preferences of caudal dCx for rostral LGN inputs (and vice versa), dCx doesn’t have any clear layout pattern.</p>

<p>This is interesting because the simple, three-layer cortex of a reptile is a much simpler substrate for understanding vision than the complex, deep cortex of mammals. What, if not “pixel-level” information, is dCx responding to?</p>

<p>While the turtles watched movies, the researchers watched the turtles. In particular, they noticed that certain cells of dCx responded to <em>scene-level</em> stimuli: When there was a cut, or the film started or stopped, there was a burst of activity. When the same stimulus was played repeatedly, these responses died away.</p>

<p>This style of scene-level parsing in mammals is reserved for “later”, down-stream brain areas. Does this mean that turtles are using dCx as both early signal processing as well as higher-level object recognition and interpretation? If so, does this mean that mammalian brains, with discrete areas for low-level and high-level vision, evolved from an earlier system where all of these tasks were colocated?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the previous parts of this series we studied the core of the CPython interpreter and saw how the most fundamental aspects of Python are implemented. We made an overview of <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">the CPython VM</a>, took a look at <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">the CPython compiler</a>, stepped through <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">the CPython source code</a>, studied <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">how the VM executes the bytecode</a> and learned <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">how variables work</a>. In the two most recent posts we focused on <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">the Python object system</a>. We learned what Python objects and Python types are, how they are defined and what determines their behavior. This discussion gave us a good understanding of how Python objects work in general. What we haven't discussed is how particular objects, such as strings, integers and lists, are implemented. In this and several upcoming posts we'll cover the implementations of the most important and most interesting built-in types. The subject of today's post is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Why Python integers are interesting</h2>
<p>Integers require no introduction. They are so ubiquitous and seem so basic that you may doubt whether it's worth discussing how they are implemented at all. Yet, Python integers are interesting because they are not just 32-bit or 64-bit integers that CPUs work with natively. Python integers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">arbitrary-precision integers</a>, also known as bignums. This means that they can be as large as we want, and their sizes are only limited by the amount of available memory.</p>
<p>Bignums are handy to work with because we don't need to worry about such things as integer overflows and underflows. They are extensively used in fields like cryptography and computer algebra where large numbers arise all the time and must be represented precisely. So, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software">many</a> programming languages have bignums built-in. These include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Haskell, Erlang, Julia, Racket. Others provide bignums as a part of the standard library. These include Go, Java, C#, D, PHP. Numerous third-party libraries implement bignums. The most popular one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library</a> (GMP). It provides a C API but has bindings for all major languages.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bignum implementations. They're different in detail, but the general approach to implement bignums is the same. Today we'll see what this approach looks like and use CPython's implementation as a reference example. The two main questions we'll have to answer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to represent bignums; and</li>
<li>how to performs arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, on bignums.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also discuss how CPython's implementation compares to others and what CPython does to make integers more efficient. </p>
<h2>Bignum representation</h2>
<p>Think for a moment how you would represent large integers in your program if you were to implement them yourself. Probably the most obvious way to do that is to store an integer as a sequence of digits, just like we usually write down numbers. For example, the integer <code>51090942171709440000</code> could be represented as <code>[5, 1, 0, 9, 0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. This is essentially how bignums are represented in practice. The only important difference is that instead of base 10, much larger bases are used. For example, CPython uses base 2^15 or base 2^30 depending on the platform. What's wrong with base 10? If we represent each digit in a sequence with a single byte but use only 10 out of 256 possible values, it would be very memory-inefficient. We could solve this memory-efficiency problem if we use base 256, so that each digit takes a value between 0 and 255. But still much larger bases are used in practice. The reason for that is because larger base means that numbers have less digits, and the less digits numbers have, the faster arithmetic operations are performed. The base cannot be arbitrary large. It's typically limited by the size of the integers that the CPU can work with. We'll see why this is the case when we discuss bignum arithmetic in the next section. Now let's take a look at how CPython represents bignums.</p>
<p>Everything related to the representation of Python integers can be found in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longintrepr.h"><code>Include/longintrepr.h</code></a>. Technically, Python integers are instances of <code>PyLongObject</code>, which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.9/Include/longobject.h"><code>Include/longobject.h</code></a>, but <code>PyLongObject</code> is actually a typedef for <code>struct _longobject</code> that is defined in <code>Include/longintrepr.h</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>_longobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>digit</span> <span>ob_digit</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This struct extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyVarObject"><code>PyVarObject</code></a>, which in turn extends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject"><code>PyObject</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, besides a reference count and a type that all Python objects have, an integer object has two other members: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>ob_size</code> that comes from <code>PyVarObject</code>; and </li>
<li><code>ob_digit</code> that is defined in <code>struct _longobject</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ob_digit</code> member is a pointer to an array of digits. On 64-bit platforms, each digit is a 30-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^30-1 and is stored as an unsigned 32-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>uint32_t</code>). On 32-bit platforms, each digit is a 15-bit integer that takes values between 0 and 2^15-1 and is stored as an unsigned 16-bit int (<code>digit</code> is a typedef for <code>unsigned short</code>). To make things concrete, in this post we'll assume that digits are 30 bits long.</p>
<p>The <code>ob_size</code> member is a signed int, whose absolute value tells us the number of digits in the <code>ob_digit</code> array. The sign of <code>ob_size</code> indicates the sign of the integer. Negative <code>ob_size</code> means that the integer is negative. If <code>ob_size</code> is 0, then the integer is 0.</p>
<p>Digits are stored in a little-endian order. The first digit (<code>ob_digit[0]</code>) is the least significant, and the last digit (<code>ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1]</code>) is the most significant.</p>
<p>Finally, the absolute value of an integer is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>$$val = ob\_digit[0] \times (2 ^{30})^0 + ob\_digit[1] \times (2 ^{30})^1 + \cdots + ob\_digit[|ob\_size| - 1] \times (2 ^{30})^{|ob\_size| - 1}$$</p>
<p>Let's see what all of this means with an example. Suppose we have an integer object that has <code>ob_digit = [3, 5, 1]</code> and <code>ob_size = -3</code>. To compute its value, we can do the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$ python -q</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>base</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>**</span><span>30</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>0</span> <span>+</span> <span>5</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>*</span> <span>base</span><span>**</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span>-1152921509975556099</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now let's do the reverse. Suppose we want to get the bignum representation of the number <code>51090942171709440000</code>. Here's how we can do that:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>51090942171709440000</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>952369152</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>337507546</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>44</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span> <span>//</span> <span>base</span><span>)</span> <span>%</span> <span>base</span>
<span>0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, <code>ob_digit = [952369152, 337507546, 44]</code> and <code>ob_size = 3</code>. Actually, we don't even have to compute the digits, we can get them by inspecting the integer object using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes"><code>ctypes</code></a> standard library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>ctypes</span>

<p>As you might guess, the representation of bignums is an easy part. The main challenge is to implement arithmetic operations and to implement them efficiently.</p>
<h2>Bignum arithmetic</h2>
<p>We learned in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-6-how-python-object-system-works/">part 6</a> that the behavior of a Python object is determined by the object's type. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. So, to understand how CPython performs arithmetic operations on integers, we need to study the slots of the <code>int</code> type that implement those operations.</p>
<p>In the C code, the <code>int</code> type is called <code>PyLong_Type</code>. It's defined in <code>Objects/longobject.c</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>PyLong_Type</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><em>Hey, Nathan here! Remember a few months ago when we published a wonderful essay on&nbsp;</em><a href="https://every.to/divinations/linkedins-alternate-universe-21780381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedInâ€™s ridiculousness</em></a><em>? It was one of Divinations most popular posts ever, and it was written by </em><a href="https://twitter.com/fadeke_adegbuyi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fadeke Adegbuyi</em></a><em>, a brilliant observer of internet culture who also is a senior marketing manager at Doist. Today Iâ€™m thrilled to share with you Fadekeâ€™s latest workâ€”this time examining our obsession with identity through the lens of a Twitter bio tracking app called Spoonbill. Enjoy!</em></p><hr><p>Elon Musk updated his Twitter bio 23 times in 2020. He last changed it on February 4, 2021 at 6:31 AM PST. A few versions include â€œBorn 69 days after 4/20,â€� â€œSoundCloud Rockstar,â€� â€œBudgie Smuggler,â€� and â€œ#bitcoin.â€� I didnâ€™t spend months stalking Muskâ€™s page, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of his time spent in the Twitterverse. I looked it up on <a href="http://spoonbill.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Spoonbill</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_1.png"></a></p><p>I could use the app to give you similar information on any celebrity or public figure with a Twitter account. Or I could use it on you. If I wanted to, I could see all the changes youâ€™ve made to your profile since you first signed up: your name, your location, your website, your pinned tweets. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_2.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/justinmduke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin M. Duke</a>, describes the app, which has nearly 93 thousand users, as a â€œtracking tool for online metadata.â€� Over 45K of those users have signed up to receive daily emails that aggregate updates across all the Twitter profiles they follow. The open rate for these daily emails hovers around 55%, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/what-are-the-average-click-and-read-rates-for-email-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well above average</a> for email campaigns.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_3.png"></a></p><p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hunter Walk</a>, a Partner at the seed-stage venture capital firm Homebrew and an avid Spoonbiller, why he uses the app :</p><blockquote><em>"It's fun to see people wordsmithing their bios, changing the order of the portfolio companies they list based on startup performance, subtly announcing personal life changes...Instead of letting Twitter decide what's worthy of notification, I get to see </em>every<em> change and decide for myself what's interesting, often with context that the algorithm is unaware of."</em></blockquote><p>The tracked changes that Twitterâ€™s algorithm might register as neutral additions and subtractions can indeed be revealing to onlookers. Spoonbill captures what the people we follow are changing their bios to express; an investment exit, a tongue-in-cheek joke, or the end of an internet cult affiliation.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_New.png"></a></p><p>Social apps have made creepers out of all of us. Whether itâ€™s scrolling to the start of someoneâ€™s Instagram feed or <a href="https://sarajbenincasa.medium.com/confessions-of-a-venmo-voyeur-cb0e4c23d04a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">looking through Venmo transactions</a>, weâ€™re constantly peering into othersâ€™ online lives. Spoonbill not only satisfies our tendency for online lurking, but pushes it into voyeur territory; surfacing whatâ€™s meant to be hidden is intimate in a way that scrolling a timeline isnâ€™t. The tool provides a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, the unseen effort with which we express our identities, and how the uncanny feeling of being watched informs our sense of self.</p><p>Twitter is an interesting observation ground for online identity. Snapshots at Big Sur are meant for Instagramâ€™s photogenic feed, while professional milestones belong on <a href="https://divinations.every.to/p/linkedins-alternate-universe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedInâ€™s alternate universe</a>. But in the Twitterverse, life and work converge. People are just as likely to share career news as they are to live-tweet a Netflix binge; professional gripes commingle with criticism of political leaders; snark and sincerity live side-by-side. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_4.png"></a></p><p>Twitterâ€™s bio section, then, is a tall order: <em>compress your entire identity into a single line item</em>. Many use the space to convey their own complexityâ€“â€“smart yet funny, accomplished but approachable. Society has progressed past the need for the phrase â€œworks hard, plays hard,â€� but thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to convey in our own personalized way: we contain multitudes. We are real.</p><p>Spoonbill reveals the way that people play with their latest positioning of self, carving out character space for their newly important aspects of identity.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_7.png"></a></p><p>Hustle culture looms large and professional accomplishments convey worth. In turn, notable work, career highlights, and impressive affiliations take center stage in our Twitter bios, the structure and grammar of which are heavily coded. Freelance journalists add and shuffle their bylines, arranged in order of prestige â€“â€“ @nytimes is meant to come first. In my corner of Tech Twitter, where optionality is king, itâ€™s now effectively a meme to be <em>â€œstarting something new,â€�</em> marked increasingly by the addition of â€œSubstack:â€�, â€œScout:â€�, or â€œSide project:â€� to oneâ€™s bio. Users adding â€œ<em>permanent student</em>â€� or â€œ<em>forever learning</em>â€� to their bios arenâ€™t pupils at cruel and unusual institutions, theyâ€™re signalling intellectual curiosity.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_8.png"></a></p><p>The ability to see Twitter bio updates across hundreds or thousands of profiles over time make Spoonbill updates insightful in aggregate. Certain patterns and conventions emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>Spoonbillâ€™s creator has observed interesting trends in his app:</p><blockquote><em>"On an individual/corporate basis, a particularly fun one is seeing angels and investors tinker with the parts of the portfolio they </em><a href="http://spoonbill.io/twitter/data/Jason/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>choose to highlight</em></a><em>. A very classic example of this was the sheer number of firms and investors who removed things mentioning WeWork during, well, the period of time that you didnâ€™t want your name associated with WeWork."</em></blockquote><p>WeWork reached a $47 billion valuation in 2019, but cancelled their plans to go public <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-ipo-timeline-delayed-ceo-adam-neumann-scandals-explained-2019-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after their IPO filing drew questions and concerns</a>. In a bio block thatâ€™s meant for selling ourselves to a potential follower, a failed investment takes up valuable real estate. But while WeWork investors might wish we would all forget their involvement as quickly as they hit â€œsaveâ€� on their new bio, Spoonbill always knows.</p><p>In that same 160-character space, weâ€™re also meant to declare our commitment to cause: political, social, or economic. Often, emojis will do:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_9.png"></a></p><p>If you watch Spoonbill updates closely enough, they suggest that the labels and descriptors we choose to signal our allegiances can be fleeting, our attention spans short. As COVID-19 spread throughout the world in early 2020, many updated their bios with their own messages about the virus, encouraging their followers to take some form of action:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_10.png"></a></p><p>But almost as quickly as these bio changes were made, they were unmade, individuals returning to their regular profiles. Less charitably, people just got bored; short-term vigilance surrounding the virus eventually led to a return to normal life for many. More charitably, the longer the pandemic wore on, identities once swaddled in concern for the virus eventually needed some wiggle room.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, as racial tensions bubbled to a boil throughout the United States and set off an international cascade, Spoonbill revealed how Twitter bios were used to show support for what was top of mindâ€“â€“or a stance on what was top of the fold:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_11.png"></a></p><p>As time went on, it was jarring but predictable to see lines through phrases like â€œBlack lives matterâ€� across swaths of profile updates in my inbox. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_12.png"></a></p><p>Politics similarly finds its way into our descriptions of self. With the 2020 U.S. presidential election, many translated their desired vote on the ballot to their bio: </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_13.png"></a></p><p>The story has already been written, and you know what comes next: dashed presidential dreams translated to crossed-out candidates. Adding presidential hopefuls or even political parties to how we identify can be an exercise in disappointment. Disappointment is inevitable (after all, there can only be one). But seeing how long people hold on to their hopefuls was interesting; some still signalling long after their candidate had dropped out.</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_14.png"></a></p><p>These tracked changes of our online selves provide a glimpse into the specific ways we represent ourselves to the world, how society manages to infect our identities, and, what we valueâ€”or what we want to be seen as valuing.</p><p>Spoonbill uncovers the tacit labor involved in our quest for the perfect personal positioning. In describing the way online influencers take effortless-looking selfies that are actually quite effortful, <a href="https://twitter.com/wishcrys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Crystal Abidin (aka wishcrys)</a>, a researcher and â€œanthropologist of influencer culturesâ€� (according to her own Twitter bio), <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305116641342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coined the term â€œtacit laborâ€�</a> as:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>â€œA collective practice of work that is understated and under-visibilized from being so thoroughly rehearsed that it appears as effortless and subconscious.â€�</em></blockquote><p>You donâ€™t need to be an influencer to know the labor involved in taking and selecting a selfie. Getting the right light, angle, and expression are just some of the considerations made while snapping and choosing from the photos that fill our camera rolls. After selecting the winning shot, we leave behind a stream of rejected selfies, never to see the light of day; the tacit labor stays hidden. After a photo has been cropped, filtered, and face-tuned, a refined â€œselfâ€�-ie joins the feed, adding to our curated online imageâ€“â€“polished, carefree, or somewhere in between.</p><p>Just like we strain for the perfect selfie, we tinker to find the perfect bio, treating it as a personal sales pitch and making micro edits to what we represent and â€œwho we are.â€� Spoonbill catalogues every time-stamped keystroke and tracked changeâ€“â€“from the removal of a single stuffy period to self-consciously swapping â€œMarketerâ€� for â€œStorytellerâ€� and reverting back again.&nbsp; Like the photos in your camera roll, your current Twitter bio has leftâ€“â€“for Spoonbill users to seeâ€“â€“a wake of rejected selves. </p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/1495/optimized_5.png"></a></p><p>Spoonbill reveals the surprising scale and frenzying frequency with which all kinds of people make these online edits. We add in emojis, expand and shrink our past affiliations, and flirt briefly with humor, adding clever one-liners before eventually reverting to something more serious. Itâ€™s effortfulness on display. Seeing people iterate on their identities in Spoonbill, switching too-formal uppercase for carefree lowercase characters, makes our desire to control how …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Two things that aren’t changing are (1) customers are always going to want simpler ways to interact with their cloud infrastructure and (2) they’re always going to want tools to understand where their cloud costs are coming from to make better business decisions. Vantage is aiming to help with both of these challenges but customers also use other tools to help make informed business decisions. One of the most popular tools we found people using is Ec2instances.info and today I’m happy to announce that Ec2instances.info is joining forces with Vantage.</p><p>Ec2instances.info will now reside at instances.vantage.sh and exists in its same form. The site will continue to be completely free and we have plans to add more features and functionality to it, including additional service prices beyond virtual machine pricing. We’ve ensured that the redirects have backwards compatibility with the prior domain so everything should continue to work as expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Garret Heaton, the creator of Ec2instances.info, says:<br></p><blockquote>After running ec2instances.info as a side project for <a href="https://powdahound.com/2011/03/hosting-a-static-site-on-amazon-s3-ec2instances-info/">almost a decade</a> I'm thrilled to hand over the reins to the Vantage team. Watching the site help people year after year has been a real pleasure and I'm very grateful for all the bug reports and improvements submitted by the public. In recent years the amount of choice available in instance types has grown significantly so comparing them is especially important, but I haven't had time to improve the site at the same rate.

First Wave Antiracism battled slavery and segregation. Second Wave Antiracism, in the 1970s and 1980s, battled racist attitudes and taught America that being racist was a flaw. Third Wave Antiracism, becoming mainstream in the 2010s, teaches that racism is baked into the structure of society, so whites’ “complicity” in living within it constitutes racism itself, while for black people, grappling with the racism surrounding them is the totality of experience and must condition exquisite sensitivity toward them, including a suspension of standards of achievement and conduct.</p><p>Third Wave Antiracist tenets, stated clearly and placed in simple oppositions, translate into nothing whatsoever:</p><ol><li><p>When black people say you have insulted them, apologize with profound sincerity and guilt. <strong>But </strong>don’t put black people in a position where you expect them to forgive you. They have dealt with too much to be expected to.</p></li><li><p>Black people are a conglomeration of disparate individuals. “Black culture” is code for “pathological, primitive ghetto people.” <strong>But </strong>don’t expect black people to assimilate to “white” social norms because black people have a culture of their own.</p></li><li><p>Silence about racism is violence. <strong>But </strong>elevate the voices of the oppressed over your own.</p></li><li><p>You must strive eternally to understand the experiences of black people. <strong>But </strong>you can never understand what it is to be black, and if you think you do you’re a racist.</p></li><li><p>Show interest in multiculturalism.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>do not culturally appropriate. What is not your culture is not for you, and you may not try it or do it. But—if you aren’t nevertheless <em>interested</em> in it, you are a racist.</p></li><li><p>Support black people in creating their own spaces and stay out of them. <strong>But </strong>seek to have black friends. If you don’t have any, you’re a racist. And if you claim any, they’d better be <em>good</em> friends—in their private spaces, you aren’t allowed in.</p></li><li><p>When whites move away from&nbsp;black neighborhoods, it’s white flight.&nbsp;<strong>But </strong>when whites move into black neighborhoods, it’s gentrification, even when they pay black residents generously for their houses.</p></li><li><p>If you’re white and only date white people, you’re a racist. <strong>But </strong>if you’re white and date a black person you are, if only deep down, exotifying an “other.”</p></li><li><p>Black people cannot be held accountable for everything every black person does. <strong>But </strong>all whites must acknowledge their personal complicity in the perfidy throughout history of “whiteness.”</p></li><li><p>Black students must be admitted to schools via adjusted grade and test score standards to ensure a representative number of them and foster a diversity of views in classrooms. <strong>But </strong>it is racist to assume a black student was admitted to a school via racial preferences, and racist to expect them to represent the “diverse” view in classroom discussions.</p></li></ol><p>I suspect that deep down, most know that none of this catechism makes any sense. Less obvious is that it was not even composed with logic in mind. The self-contradiction of these tenets is crucial, in revealing that Third Wave Antiracism is not a philosophy but a religion. </p><p>The revelation of racism is, itself and alone, the point, the intention, of this curriculum. As such, the fact that if you think a little, the tenets cancel one another out, is considered trivial. That they serve their true purpose of revealing people as bigots is paramount—sacrosanct, as it were. Third Wave Antiracism’s needlepoint homily <em>par excellence</em> is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Battling power relations and their discriminatory effects must be the central focus of all human endeavor, be it intellectual, moral, civic or artistic. Those who resist this focus, or even evidence insufficient adherence to it, must be sharply condemned, deprived of influence, and ostracized.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism is losing innocent people jobs.</strong> It is coloring, detouring and sometimes strangling academic inquiry. It forces us to render a great deal of our public discussion of urgent issues in doubletalk any 10-year-old can see through. It forces us to start teaching our actual 10-year-olds, in order to hold them off from spoiling the show in that way, to believe in sophistry in the name of enlightenment. On that, Third Wave Antiracism guru Ibram X. Kendi has written a book on how to raise antiracist children called <em>Antiracist Baby</em>. You couldn’t imagine it better: Are we in a Christopher Guest movie? This and so much else is a sign that Third Wave Antiracism forces us to pretend that performance art is politics. It forces us to spend endless amounts of time listening to nonsense presented as wisdom, and pretend to like it.</p><p>I write this viscerally driven by the fact that all of this supposed wisdom is founded in an ideology under which white people calling themselves our saviors make black people look like the dumbest, weakest, most self-indulgent human beings in the history of our species, and teach black people to revel in that status and cherish it as making us special. Talking of <em>Antiracist Baby</em>, I am especially dismayed at the idea of this indoctrination infecting my daughters’ sense of self. I can’t always be with them, and this anti-humanist ideology may seep into their school curriculum. I shudder at the thought: teachers with eyes shining at the prospect of showing their antiracism by teaching my daughters that they are poster children rather than individuals. </p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates in <em>Between the World and Me</em> wanted to teach his son that America is set against him; I want to teach my kids the reality of their lives in the 21st&nbsp;rather than early-to-mid-20th century. Lord forbid my daughters internalize a pathetic—yes, absolutely pathetic in all of the resonances of that word—sense that what makes them interesting is what other people think of them, or don’t.</p><p>Many will see me as traitorous in writing this as a black person. They will not understand that I see myself as serving my race by writing it. One of the grimmest tragedies of how this perversion of sociopolitics makes us think (or, not think) is that it will bar more than a few black readers from understanding that I am calling for them to be treated with true dignity. However, they and everyone else should also realize: I know quite well that white readers will be more likely to hear out views like this when written by a black person, and consider it nothing less than my duty as a black person to write it.</p><p>A white version of this would be blithely dismissed as racist. I will be dismissed instead as self-hating by a certain crowd. But frankly, they won’t really mean it, and anyone who gets through <a href="https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/the-elect-neoracists-posing-as-antiracists">my new book</a> on this subject, which I am now publishing in serial, will see that whatever traits I harbor, hating myself or being ashamed of being black is not one of them. And we shall move on. As in, to realizing that what I am documenting matters, and matters deeply. Namely, that America’s sense of what it is to be intellectual, moral, or artistic; what it is to educate a child; what it is to foster justice; what is to express oneself properly; what it is to be a nation—all is being refounded upon a religion. </p><p>This is directly antithetical to the very foundations of the American experiment. Religion has no place in the classroom, in the halls of ivy, in our codes of ethics, or in deciding how we express ourselves, and almost all of us spontaneously understand that and see any misunderstanding of the premise as backward. Yet since about 2015, a peculiar contingent has been slowly headlocking us into making an exception, supposing that this new religion is so incontestably good, so gorgeously surpassing millennia of brilliant philosophers’ attempts to identify the ultimate morality, that we can only bow down in humble acquiescence.</p><p>But a new religion in the guise of world progress is not an advance; it is a detour. It is not altruism; it is self-help. It is not sunlight; it is fungus. It’s time it became ordinary to call it for what it is and stop cowering before it, letting it make people so much less than they—black and everything else—could be.</p><p><strong>Third Wave Antiracism exploits modern Americans’ fear</strong> of being thought racist, using this to promulgate an obsessive, self-involved, totalitarian and unnecessary kind of cultural reprogramming. One could be excused for thinking this glowering kabuki is a continuation of the Civil Rights efforts of yore, the only kind of new antiracism there could be. Its adherents preach with such contemptuous indignation, and are now situated in the most prestigious and influential institutions in the land—on their good days they can seem awfully “correct.”</p><p>However, there is nothing correct about the essence of American thought and culture being transplanted into the soil of a religious faith. Some will go as far as to own up to it being a religion, and wonder why we can’t just accept it as our new national creed. The problem is that on matters of societal procedure and priorities, the adherents of this religion—true to the very nature of religion—cannot be reasoned with. They are, in this, medievals with lattes.</p><p>We need not wonder what the basic objections will be: Third Wave Antiracism isn’t really a religion; I am oversimplifying; I shouldn’t write this without being a theologian; it is a religion but it’s a good one; and so on. I will get all of that out of the way as we go on, and then offer some genuine solutions. But first, what this is not.</p><ol><li><p><em>It is not an argument against protest.</em> I am not arguing against the basic premises of Black Lives Matter, although I have had my differences with some of its offshoot developments. I am not arguing that the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s would have been better off sticking to quiet negotiations. I am not arguing against the left. I am arguing against a particular strain of the left that has come to exert a grievous influence over American institutions, to the point that we are beginning to …</p></li></ol></div></div>

  <div>
    <section>  </section> <string></string> <section><p>If you haven't worked in a typed language before, it may not be obvious at first the power that it brings.  This article will show you how to leverage the type system to make your code easier to use and more reusable.</p> <h4>Target Audience</h4> <p>This article is aimed at developers that are new to Go and have little to no Go experience.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <p>For this article, we will look at how to handle <code language="plain">categorical</code> data.  In this case, specifically how to handle the <code language="plain">genre</code> category for classifying a book.</p> <p>To start, we'll define a data structure for a <code language="plain">Book</code> , in which we'll want to categorize it via the <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v1/books.go">package books

type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre string
}</code></pre>   <p>Now that we have the book defined, let's go ahead and define some constants for <code language="plain">genre</code> :</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v1/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = "Adventure"
	Comic         = "Comic"
	Crime         = "Crime"
	Fiction       = "Fiction"
	Fantasy       = "Fantasy"
	Historical    = "Historical"
	Horror        = "Horror"
	Magic         = "Magic"
	Mystery       = "Mystery"
	Philosophical = "Philosophical"
	Political     = "Political"
	Romance       = "Romance"
	Science       = "Science"
	Superhero     = "Superhero"
	Thriller      = "Thriller"
	Western       = "Western"
)</code></pre>   <p>So far, this seems fine.  However, the <code language="plain">genre</code> constants are strings.  While this makes for a very "humanized" way of reading the code, it's not very efficient as it pertains to a computer program.  Strings will take up more storage space, and more memory in the program (not to mention if we stored millions of data records to a database).  As such, we really want to use a smaller data type to represent this data.</p> <p>In Go, one way we can do this is to create constants that are based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v2/books.go">const (
	Adventure     = 1
	Comic         = 2
	Crime         = 3
	Fiction       = 4
	Fantasy       = 5
	Historical    = 6
	Horror        = 7
	Magic         = 8
	Mystery       = 9
	Philosophical = 10
	Political     = 11
	Romance       = 12
	Science       = 13
	Superhero     = 14
	Thriller      = 15
	Western       = 16
)</code></pre>   <p>We also need to change the <code language="plain">Book</code> structure to now represent <code language="plain">Genre</code> as an int:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="book" src="./src/v2/books.go">type Book struct {
	ID    int
	Name  string
	Genre int
}</code></pre>   <p>While we now have a more effecient memory model for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , it's not as "human" friendly.  If I print out the value of a <code language="plain">Book</code> , we now just get an integer value.  To show this, we'll write a quick test showing the output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">package books

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre, 8; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %d, exp %d", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>And here is the output.</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v2/books_test.go">$ go test -v ./...
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:14: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:8}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/gopherguides/corp/_blog/types/leveraging-types/src/v2     (cached)</code></pre>   <p>Notice that the <code language="plain">Genre</code> just shows a value of <code language="plain">8</code> .  Any time we debug the code, or write a report, etc, we now need to figure out what <code language="plain">8</code> actually represents for a human being.</p> <p>To do this, we can write a helper function that takes the <code language="plain">Genre</code> value, and determines what the "human" representation should be:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v2/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case 1:
		return "Adventure"
	case 2:
		return "Comic"
	case 3:
		return "Crime"
	case 4:
		return "Fiction"
	case 5:
		return "Fantasy"
	case 6:
		return "Historical"
	case 7:
		return "Horror"
	case 8:
		return "Magic"
	case 9:
		return "Mystery"
	case 10:
		return "Philosophical"
	case 11:
		return "Political"
	case 12:
		return "Romance"
	case 13:
		return "Science"
	case 14:
		return "Superhero"
	case 15:
		return "Thriller"
	case 16:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <h2>A Better Way</h2> <p>While all the above code works fine, it's really missing some key points.</p> <ul><li><p>If a value for a <code language="plain">Genre</code> has to change in the future, we not only have to change the constant value, but we also have to update the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  If we don't, this will create a bug in our code.</p></li> <li><p>We aren't leveraging the type system to encapsulate this behavior for <code language="plain">Genre</code> .  We'll show you what we mean by that shortly.</p></li></ul> <p>The first thing we really need to do is write a more resilient <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function.  What we mean by resilient is that even if the value of the <code language="plain">Genre</code> constant changes in the future, the <code language="plain">GenreToString</code> function will not need to change.</p> <p>The correct way to do that is no longer use hard coded values, but use the value of the constant themselves:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v3/books.go">func GenreToString(i int) string {
	switch i {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Ok, that's much cleaner (and readable), but we still haven't solved the fact that when we print it out, it shows a data value ( <code language="plain">int</code> ), and not a "human" readable value.</p> <h2>Types to the Rescue</h2> <p>Instead of using a generic <code language="plain">int</code> type for <code language="plain">Genre</code> , we can create our own type based on an existing type.  In this case, we'll create a new type called <code language="plain">Genre</code> based on the <code language="plain">int</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="genre" src="./src/v4/books.go">type Genre int</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll define our constants as <code language="plain">Genre</code> types:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="constants" src="./src/v4/books.go">const (
	Adventure     Genre = 1
	Comic         Genre = 2
	Crime         Genre = 3
	Fiction       Genre = 4
	Fantasy       Genre = 5
	Historical    Genre = 6
	Horror        Genre = 7
	Magic         Genre = 8
	Mystery       Genre = 9

)</code></pre>   <p>So far, the code doesn't really feel different.  However, now that <code language="plain">Genre</code> is it's own type, we can add methods to it.  This allows us to encapsulate the "human" behavior we want to the type, and not as a generic function.</p> <p>To do this, we'll add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to the <code language="plain">Genre</code> type:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="string" src="./src/v4/books.go">func (g Genre) String() string {
	switch g {
	case Adventure:
		return "Adventure"
	case Comic:
		return "Comic"
	case Crime:
		return "Crime"
	case Fiction:
		return "Fiction"
	case Fantasy:
		return "Fantasy"
	case Historical:
		return "Historical"
	case Horror:
		return "Horror"
	case Magic:
		return "Magic"
	case Mystery:
		return "Mystery"
	case Philosophical:
		return "Philosophical"
	case Political:
		return "Political"
	case Romance:
		return "Romance"
	case Science:
		return "Science"
	case Superhero:
		return "Superhero"
	case Thriller:
		return "Thriller"
	case Western:
		return "Western"
	default:
		return ""
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Now, we'll be able to use the <code language="plain">String</code> method when we want to see what the "human" value of a <code language="plain">Genre</code> is:</p> <pre><code language="go">b := Book{
	ID:    1,
	Name:  "All About Go",
	Genre: Magic,
}
fmt.Println(b.Genre.String())</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="sh">Magic</code></pre> <h2>Magic Formatting</h2> <p>In Go, if you add a <code language="plain">String</code> method to any type, the <code language="plain">fmt</code> package will now use your <code language="plain">String</code> method to "pretty print" the representation of your type.  Because of this, we will now see that if we print out the <code language="plain">book</code> in our tests, we get a "human-readable" <code language="plain">Genre</code> as well:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="test" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">func TestGenre(t *testing.T) {
	b := Book{
		ID:    1,
		Name:  "All About Go",
		Genre: Magic,
	}

	t.Logf("%+v\n", b)

	if got, exp := b.Genre.String(), "Magic"; got != exp {
		t.Errorf("unexpected genre.  got %q, exp %q", got, exp)
	}
}</code></pre>   <p>Output:</p> <pre><code language="plain" snippet="output" src="./src/v4/books_test.go">$ go test -v -run=TestGenre -count=1 .
=== RUN   TestGenre
    books_test.go:16: {ID:1 Name:All About Go Genre:Magic}
--- PASS: TestGenre (0.00s)
PASS
ok      book    0.059s</code></pre>   <p>We now see the value for <code language="plain">Genre</code> in the printed output is <code language="plain">Magic</code> , and not <code language="plain">8</code> . It's also important to note that our test actually didn't change, only the way in which we leveraged our new type for <code language="plain">Genre</code> .</p> <h2>What about Iota?</h2> <p>For those of you that are familiar with Go already, you might have looked at this problem and asked "Why didn't you just use iota?". <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Iota" target="_blank">Iota</a> is an identifier that you can use in Go to also create incrementing number constants.

<p><em><strong>Abstract : </strong><span lang="en">In this post we describe the construction of a small amateur radio telescope operating at the frequency of 11.2 GHz. The construction of the radio telescope takes advantage of the satellite TV market which has made it easy and cheap to find parabolic reflector antennas with relative illuminator (feed horn) and LNB block (low noise amplifier-frequency converter). The performances of a similar instrument are naturally rather limited, however they still allow to make interesting observations of some of the most intense radio sources.</span></em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Radio astronomy is a difficult and fascinating science. It requires the use of bulky and expensive antennas, uses sophisticated radio-electronic technologies and sophisticated algorithms for signal processing. At first glance it would seem completely beyond the reach of an “amateur”. In reality it is possible to make interesting radio astronomical observations even at an amateur level.<br>
On our site we have already described some radio astronomy projects for specific applications:</p>

</ul>
<p>Now we want to try to make an “amateur” radio telescope based on the principle of the <strong>radiometer</strong>. This is certainly not the place to give detailed information on radio astronomy and radio telescopes (there is a lot of information on the net and specific texts), so we limit ourselves to providing some hints on the main points that guided us in the construction of the radio telescope.</p>
<p>Radio astronomy studies celestial bodies by analyzing the radio waves emitted by objects in the sky: any object emits electromagnetic waves through various physical processes (thermal and non-thermal), these waves are picked up by the antenna and analyzed with appropriate instruments: in general the characteristics of the captured signal are no different from those that characterize a <strong>broad spectrum electrical noise</strong>. The purpose of the radio telescope is to pick up this radiation and measure the signal strength, such an instrument is called a radiometer. To be precise, we speak of power per unit area and per unit of bandwidth and is expressed in Jansky&nbsp;: <strong>1Jy = 10<sup>-26</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> Hz</strong>.</p>
<p>The range of radio frequencies useful for radio astronomy observations is between <strong>20 MHz</strong> and about <strong>20 GHz</strong>: below 20 MHz there is absorption by the ionosphere, above 20 GHz there is absorption by of the gases present in the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">To choose the most suitable frequency band for an amateur radio telescope we must make a compromise between the observation possibilities and the cost and feasibility constraints. The frequency spectrum of the radio-source emissions depends on the underlying physical process: for “thermal” emissions such as the sun or the moon, the intensity follows the <strong>law of the black body</strong> with maximums at high frequencies (according to the approximation of Rayleigh-Jeans<strong> I ∝ 1/λ<sup>4</sup></strong>), while for non-thermal emissions (for example synchrotron emission) the maximums are at lower frequencies, as can be seen in the graph below which shows the intensity of some radio sources as a function of frequency.</span><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png"><img data-attachment-id="14927" data-permalink="https://physicsopenlab.org/2020/10/10/un-semplice-radiotelescopio-a-11-2-ghz/radiosorgenti/" data-orig-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" data-orig-size="658,756" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="radiosorgenti" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti-261x300.png" data-large-file="https://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" loading="lazy" src="http://physicsopenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/radiosorgenti.png" alt="" width="450" height="515"></a></p>
<p>As we know the dimensions of the antenna are related to the wavelength of the radiation to be received, furthermore our antenna must be sufficiently directive, otherwise it would be practically useless: this means that to receive frequencies below 1 GHz the dimensions of the antenna should be significantly greater than 1m: large antennas are expensive and difficult to move.<br>
Another aspect to consider is external radio interference. The ether, especially in the city, is now saturated with transmissions and RF signals from the most heterogeneous origin: radio and TV broadcasting, cellular networks, WiFi networks, disturbances from power lines, etc …. Not having the possibility to install the radio telescope in “quiet” places we must choose a frequency band that is not too disturbed.</p>
<p>For the reasons described above, the choice is almost obligatory: the <strong>10-12 GHz frequency band</strong> is the one that seems most suitable for an amateur project like ours. At these frequencies, parabolic reflector antennas and devices designed for satellite television can be re-used. The costs of the equipment are affordable, the spatial resolution of the antenna is quite good and the interference is low (basically broadcasting satellites) and easily avoidable.<br>
Working at lower frequencies would make it possible to easily receive more radio sources but with a considerable increase in terms of costs, not to mention the problem of interference.</p>
<h3>Parabolic Dish Antenna</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The antenna we found on the second-hand market is a <strong>prime focus dish</strong> with a diameter of 120 cm. For radio astronomy applications it is better that the dish is of the prime focus type: in these antennas the feed horn is placed in the focus of the dish. In offset-type dishes, the feed-horn is not placed in the center but on the side, this type has constructive advantages but is more difficult to aim to the source than the prime focus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione">For this antenna we can calculate the gain and the directivity intended as half power band width HPBW (half power band width) :</p>
<p><strong>G = η*(π*D/λ) = 40 dB</strong></p>
<p><strong>HPBW = 65*λ/D = 1.45°</strong></p>
<p>Where<br>
<strong>η : efficiency = 0.5</strong><br>
<strong>D : diameter = 120 cm</strong><br>
<strong>λ : wavelength = 2.68 cm (correspond to 11.2 GHz)</strong></p>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The images below show the antenna and the metal structure used for manual movement.</span></p>

<h3>LNB</h3>
<p dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The first component of the system is the converter-amplifier block, the so-called <strong>LNB</strong>. This is the most important component because system performance largely depends on it. Our system receives in the 10-12 GHz band, at these frequencies the use of cables is problematic, for this reason the LNB block provides for a frequency down conversion in a lower band so that normal coaxial cables can be used.<br>
</span><span lang="en">The following image shows the basic scheme of the LNB block: there is a first <strong>RF amplification stage</strong>, followed by the mixer which multiplies the RF signal with the signal generated by a <strong>local oscillator (LO)</strong>. The resulting signal contains the sum and difference frequencies, the next filter eliminates the high frequency sum components to let pass only the frequencies in the band of interest, called <strong>intermediate frequencies (IF)</strong>, which are further amplified by another amplifier stage. In practice it is a heterodyne scheme, in which the frequency of the local oscillator is fixed.</span></p>

<p>The LNB block we use is<strong> Invacom’s SNF-031</strong> model which has<strong> low noise</strong> and <strong>good stability</strong> of the gain parameters with respect to variations in operating temperature. The actual antenna is located inside the waveguide which has a C120 flange on the outside to which the feed horn is fixed, which has the task of collecting the waves reflected by the dish and conveying them to the inside the waveguide.</p>
<p>LNB features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating frequency band : 10.7 – 12.75 GHz</li>
<li>Intermediate frequencies (IF) : 950 – 2150 MHz, LO = 9.75 GHz</li>
<li><strong>Noise Figure NF = 0.3 dB</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gain G = 50 – 60 dB</strong></li>

<h3>The Receiver</h3>
<p id="tw-target-text" dir="ltr" data-placeholder="Traduzione"><span lang="en">The receiver consists of the few components, shown in the following image: there is a bias-T for feeding the LNB block, a bandpass filter centered at 1420 MHZ, a wide-band amplifier and the <strong>Airspy R2 SDR receiver</strong>. The “hardware” part has the function of limiting the receiving band and giving the signal a second amplification after the LNB stage. The signal is then acquired by Airspy and subsequently processed for the determination of the total power using <strong>GNURadio</strong> software. The <strong>radiometer</strong> function is practically realized through software.</span></p>

<p><strong>Features of our receiver :</strong><br>
Frequency Band = 80 MHz<br>
G<sub>LNB</sub> = 55 dB ; NF<sub>LNB</sub> = 0.3 dB<br>
G<sub>Filter</sub> = 3.5 dB (insertion loss)<br>
G<sub>Ampli</sub> = 15 dB ; NF<sub>Ampli</sub> = 0.75 dB<br>
<strong>Gain : G<sub>LNB</sub> – G<sub>Filter</sub> + G<sub>Ampli</sub> = 55 -3.5 +15 = 66.5 dB</strong><br>
<strong>Noise Figure : F = F<sub>LNB</sub> + (F<sub>Ampli</sub> – 1)/G<sub>LNB</sub> = 0.3 dB<br>
T<sub>e</sub> = (F – 1) * T<sub>0</sub> = 20.3 °K (Receiver equivalent temperature)</strong></p>
<h4>Bias-T</h4>
<p>The Bias-T has the function of “injecting” the supply voltage to the LNB block along the coaxial cable. In practice it is a simple circuit with a coupling capacitor to filter the DC component towards the RF side and an inductance at the DC input. Obtained on eBay, it can be easily self-built but attention must be paid to the “RF” quality of the components and the shielding.</p>

<h4>1420 MHz Band Pass Filter</h4>
<p>This filter is dedicated to amateur radioastronomers interested in the hydrogen line observations. It uses the TA2494A SAW component and measures only 50 x 10mm. It features edge pads for an easy soldering of a RF shield. Insertion loss is typically less than 3.5dB and bandwith 80MHz.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Data</strong> :<br>
Center Frequency <strong>1420MHz</strong><br>
Usable Bandpass <strong>1380-1460MHz</strong><br>
Insertion Loss, 1380 to 1460 MHz <strong>3.5dB</strong><br>
Amplitude Ripple, 1380 to 1460 MHz 1.0 dBpp<br>
VSWR, 1380 &nbsp;to 1420 MHz 1.9:1<br>
Rejection referenced to 0dB :<br>
DC to 1300 MHz 28dB<br>
1550 to 3000 MHz 30dB<br>
Impedance 50Ω<br>
Maximum Input Power Level 10 dBm</p>
<p>In the images below we show the unit and its frequency response. We have soldered two wires between the SMA female headers and we wrapped the filter with aluminum tape in order to shield the filter.</p>

<h4>Wideband Amplifier</h4>
<p>This unit HAB-FLTNOSAW built by UPUTRONICS is a preamp designed to go between a software defined radio receiver and an antenna. The LNA used inside is a MiniCircuits PSA4-5043. This particular model has the SAW filter removed to cover the 0.1MHz to 4GHz. There are 2 options for powering the unit : either by the USB header or via bias-tee. Devices such as the Airspy can enable bias-tee and power the device. Alternatively any mini USB cable can be used to power the device. We chose to power the unit via USB line.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Data</strong> :<br>
Gain 24db @ 100MHz -&gt; <strong>15.2db @ 1415MHz</strong><br>
<strong>NF 0.75dB</strong><br>
Supply Voltage USB or Bias tee 5V</p>

      <p>If you didn't see it, please check out <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1">part 1 of this series</a> to understand the purpose of this. Now, for more bad parts!</p>
<h2 id="partial-functions-in-general">Partial functions (in general)</h2>
<p>Laziness very likely belongs in this list. My favorite part of criticizing laziness is how quickly people jump to defend it based on edge cases. So let's be a bit more nuanced before I later get far <em>less</em> nuanced. Laziness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. Strictness is <strong>obviously</strong> a good thing. They also both suck. It depends on context and purpose. Each of them introduce different kinds of issues. The real question is: what's a more sensible default? We'll get to that another time.</p>
<p>I called this section partial functions. Am I having a senior moment? Maybe, but I intentionally started with laziness. In a strict language, function calls can result in exceptions being thrown, segfaulting occurring, or panicking. (And if I write a "Rust: The Bad Parts", believe me, I'll be mentioning panicking.) The fact that a function <em>acts</em> like it can successfully perform something, but in fact fails in a predictable way (like failing a <code>HashMap</code> lookup), it should be reflected at the type level. If not, ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a language that doesn't let you reflect this information at the type level: ya dun goofed.</p>
<p>Partial functions are the antithesis of this concept. They allow you to say "yeah dude, I can <em>totally</em> give you the first value in an empty list." Partial functions are like politicians: you can tell they're lying because their lips are moving. ("But Michael," you say. "Functions don't have lips!" Whatever, I'm waxing poetical.)</p>
<p>Alright, so plenty of languages screw this up. Haskell tells those languages "hold my beer."</p>
<p><img src="https://www.snoyman.com/static/images/holdmybeer.jpg"></p><p>Haskell screws up partial functions way, way worse than other languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>It promotes a whole bunch of them in the standard libraries and <code>Prelude</code>.</li>
<li>Some libraries, like <code>vector</code> (I'm getting to you, don't worry) make it <em>really</em> confusing by providing an <code>index</code> and <code>unsafeIndex</code> function. Hint: <code>index</code> isn't really safe, it's just less unsafe.</li>
<li>There's no obvious way to search for usages of these partial functions.</li>
<li>And, by far, the worst...</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="values-are-partial-too">Values are partial too!</h3>
<p>Only in a lazy language does this exist. You call a function. You get a result. You continue working. In any other non-lazy language, that means you have a value. If I have a <code>u32</code> in Rust, I actually have a <code>u32</code> in Rust. Null pointers in languages like C and Java somewhat muddy this situation, but at least primitive types are really there if they say they're there.</p>
<p>No, not Haskell. <code>x :: Int</code> may in fact not exist. It's a lie. <code>let x = head [] :: [Int]</code> is a box waiting to explode. And you find out <em>much</em> later. And it's even worse than that. <code>let alice = Person { name = "Alice", age = someAge }</code> may give you a valid <code>Person</code> value. You can evaluate it. But Cthulhu help you if you evaluate <code>age alice</code>. Maybe, just maybe, <code>someAge</code> is a bottom value. Boom! You've smuggled a dirty bomb out.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating for removing laziness in Haskell. In fact I'm not really advocating for much of anything in this series. I'm just complaining, because I like complaining.</p>
<p>But <em>if</em> I was to advocate some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecate partial functions</li>
<li>Introduce a naming scheme for partial functions to be more obvious</li>
<li>Introduce a compiler warning to note partial function use (with a pragma to turn off specific usages)</li>
<li>Warn by default on partial pattern matches</li>
<li>Advocate strict data fields by default</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="but-ackshualllly-infinite-loops">But ackshualllly, infinite loops</h3>
<p>Someone's gonna say it. So I'll say it. Yes, without major language changes, you can't prevent partial functions. You can't even detect them, unless Turing was wrong (and I have my suspicions.) But Haskell community, please, please learn this lesson:</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD</strong></p>
<p>We can get rid of many of the most common partial functions trivially. We can detect many common cases by looking for partial pattern matches and usage of <code>throw</code> (again, horribly named function). "But we can't get everything" doesn't mean "don't try to get something."</p>
<h2 id="hubris">Hubris</h2>
<p>Given what I just said, we Haskellers have a lot of hubris. Each time you say "if it compiles it works," a thunk dies and collapses into a blackhole. We've got plenty of messes in Haskell that don't sufficiently protect us from ourselves. The compiler can only do as good a job as our coding standards and our libraries allow.</p>
<p>"But Haskell's at least better than languages like PHP." I mean, obviously I agree with this, or I'd be writing PHP. But since I'm being ridiculously hyperbolic here, let me make a ridiculous claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PHP is better than Haskell, since at least you don't get a false sense of security</strong></p>
<p><em>- Michael Snoyman, totally 100% what he actually believes, you should totally quote this out of context</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've said this so many times. So I'll say it again. Using a great language with safety features is one tiny piece of the puzzle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you get the software requirements right?</li>
<li>Did you leverage the type system to prevent the bugs you're trying to prevent?</li>
<li>Do your underlying libraries have bugs?</li>
<li>Did you find a way to implement a function with correct types but incorrect semantics?</li>
<li>Did you host the thing on a dinky server sitting under your desk and forget that you have power outages on a daily basis?</li>
<li>Did you forget to write a single test case?</li>
<li>Do your test cases actually test anything meaningful?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <em>so many ways</em> for software to fail outside the purview of the type system. We've got to stop thinking that somehow Haskell (or, for that matter, Rust, Scala, and other strongly typed languages) are some kind of panacea. Seriously: the PHP people at least know their languages won't protect them from anything. We should bring some of that humility back to Haskell.</p>
<p>Haskell provides me tools to help prevent certain classes of bugs, so I can spend more of my time catching a bunch of other bugs that I'm absolutely going to write. Because I'm dumb. And we need to remember: we're all dumb.</p>
<h2 id="more-partial-functions">More partial functions!</h2>
<p>You know what's worse than partial functions? Insidiously partial functions. We've all been screaming about <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> for years. My hackles rise every time I see a <code>read</code> instead of <code>readMaybe</code>. I can't remember the last time I saw the <code>!!</code> operator in production code.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of other functions that are just as dangerous, if not more so. More dangerous because they aren't well known to be partial. They are commonly used. People don't understand why they're dangerous. And they fail only in edge cases that people aren't thinking about.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: I present <code>decodeUtf8</code>. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/kerckhove_ts/status/1321390954172063745?s=20">Syd</a>.)</p>
<p>Go ahead, search your codebase. Be dismayed that you've found it present.</p>
<p>What's wrong with <code>decodeUtf8</code>? As we established last time, character encoding crap breaks stuff in production. UTF-8 works about 99% of the time, especially for people in Western countries. You'll probably forget to even test for it. And that function looks so benign: <code>decodeUtf8 :: ByteString -&gt; Text</code>.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT BE FOOLED</strong></p>
<p>This function is a ticking time bomb. Use <code>decodeUtf8'</code> (yes, it's named that badly, just like <code>foldl'</code>) and explicitly handle error cases. Or use I/O functions that explicitly handle UTF-8 decoding errors and throw a runtime exception.</p>
<p>"I can't believe Michael still thinks runtime exceptions are a good idea." I'll get to that another time. I don't really believe they're a good idea. I believe they are omnipresent, better than bottom values, and our least-bad-option.</p>
<h2 id="law-abiding-type-classes">Law-abiding type classes</h2>
<p>Now I've truly lost it. What in tarnation could be wrong with law-abiding type classes? They're good, right? Yes, they are! The section heading is complete clickbait. Haha, fooled you!</p>
<p>There's a concept in the Haskell community that all type classes should be law-abiding. I've gone to the really bad extreme opposing this in the past with early versions of <code>classy-prelude</code>. In my defense: it was an experiment. But it was a bad idea. I've mostly come around to the idea of type classes being lawful. (Also, the original namespacing issues that led to <code>classy-prelude</code> really point out a much bigger bad part of Haskell, which I'll get to later. Stay tuned! Hint: Rust beat us again.)</p>
<p>Oh, right. Speaking of Rust: they do <em>not</em> believe in law-abiding type classes. There are plenty of type classes over there (though they call them <code>trait</code>s) that are completely ad-hoc. I'm looking at you, <code>FromIterator</code>. This is Very, Very Bad of course. Or so my Haskell instincts tell me. And yet, it makes code Really, Really Good. So now I'm just confused.</p>
<p>Basically: I think we need much more nuanced on this in the Haskell community. I'm leaning towards my <em>very</em> original instincts having been spot on. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Law abiding type classes: great</li>
<li>Flippantly non-law-abiding type classes ala the original <code>classy-prelude</code>: bad</li>
<li>"You know what I meant" typeclasses like <code>ToContent</code> in Yesod: also great</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't exactly in line with a "bad part" of Haskell. Up until now I've been giving a nuanced reflection on my journeys in Haskell. Let me try something better then. Ahem.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T LECTURE ME ON LAW ABIDING TYPE CLASSES AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE LAWS</strong></p>
<p>I'm staring at you, <code>Eq Double</code>. No, you cannot do equality on a <code>Double</code>. (And thanks again to Syd for this idea.) Rust, again, Got It Right. See <code>PartialEq</code> vs <code>Eq</code>. Floating point values do not allow for total equality. This makes things like <code>Map Double x</code> dangerous. Like, super dangerous. Though maybe not as dangerous as <code>HashMap Double x</code>, which deserves its own rant later.</p>
<p>So come down from your high horses. We don't have law abiding type classes. We have "if I close my eyes and pretend enough then maybe I have law abiding type classes."</p>
<h2 id="unused-import-warnings">Unused import warnings</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>There are many kinds</strong> of pseudosciences: astrology, homeopathy, flat-Earthism, anti-vaxx. These â€˜fieldsâ€™ traffic in bizarre claims with scientific pretensions. On a surface level, these claims <em>seem</em> to be scientific and usually appear to comment on the same kind of things that science does. However, upon closer inspection, pseudoscience is revealed to be <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/why-bullshit-is-no-laughing-matter" rel="noopener">bullshit</a>: it is indifferent to the truth. Analogous to pseudoscience, can there be such a thing as pseudophilosophy, in which one makes claims with philosophical pretensions which on closer inspection turn out to be bullshit? I think there is.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s begin with the concept of pseudophilosophy. If there is something deserving of that name, then it would be deficient with respect to philosophical issues in the same way that pseudoscience is deficient with respect to scientific issues. So, in order to get a grip on pseudophilosophy, we should first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/theo.12271" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">look</a> more closely at the way in which pseudoscience is deficient, and then see whether we can find something analogous in the philosophical domain.</p>
<p>What makes pseudoscientific beliefs deficient is that theyâ€™re formed in an <em>epistemically unconscientious</em> way. Thatâ€™s to say, these beliefs are made from culpably confused and uninformed reasoning. For example, the belief that the Earth is flat can be sustained only by self-willed disregard of the massive amounts of evidence to the contrary, accumulated over several centuries by several different sciences.</p>
<p>However, such unconscientiousness doesnâ€™t presuppose insincerity or charlatanry. A charlatan is someone who has a hidden, usually profit-seeking, agenda and who is fundamentally indifferent to whether their beliefs are true. Often bullshit is produced without such insincerity, however, since one can <em>care</em> about the truth of oneâ€™s beliefs without <em>taking care</em> with respect to it.</p>
<p>A problem is that most of us are lacking in epistemic conscientiousness, at least sometimes and to some extent. In order for something to count as pseudoscience, some minimal degree of unconscientiousness is therefore required. A good rule of thumb for being conscientious is to keep an eye out for classical fallacies such as <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/how-ad-hominem-arguments-can-demolish-appeals-to-authority" rel="noopener">ad hominem</a>, straw man, false dilemma and cherry-picking. Such fallacies occur in all kinds of contexts, but in pseudoscience they occur more systematically.</p>
<p>Whether there is a God or whether there are objective moral truths have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all</p>
<p>Epistemic unconscientiousness is an essential but not exhaustive component of pseudoscience. To count as pseudoscientific, a belief must also be about some scientific issue, and this is precisely where pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy differ. Just like pseudoscience, pseudophilosophy is defined by a lack of epistemic conscientiousness, but its subject matter is philosophical rather than scientific.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the difference between scientific and philosophical issues is that the latter arenâ€™t in any straightforward way resolvable via empirical investigation. Whether there is a God, for example, or whether there are objective moral truths, are questions that have to be answered largely via a priori reflection, if at all. These questions are thus different from questions such as whether the Earth is flat or spherical, or whether anthrax is caused by bacteria, which do have empirically accessible answers.</p>
<p><strong>There are two kinds of</strong> pseudophilosophy, one mostly harmless and the other insidious. The first variety is usually found in popular scientific contexts. This is where writers, typically with a background in the natural sciences, walk self-confidently into philosophical territory without realising it, and without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. Often implicit empiricist assumptions in epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of language are relied upon as if they were self-evident, and without awareness of the threat that those very assumptions pose to the authorâ€™s own reasoning. We can call this phenomenon scientistic pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>An illustrative example is Sam Harrisâ€™s <a href="https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>The Moral Landscape</em> (2010), in which straw men are lined up due to Harrisâ€™s failure to grasp the content of many of the philosophical claims and arguments that he criticises, such as Humeâ€™s law (or the is/ought problem) and <span>G E Mooreâ€™s</span> open-question argument (ie, that no moral property is identical to a natural property). Similarly, in <em>A Universe from Nothing</em> (2012), Lawrence Krauss engages with philosophical arguments for theism without understanding them properly. Most saliently, he ends up criticising a caricature version of the so-called cosmological argument about the existence of God.</p>
<p>Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity</p>
<p>The insidious kind of pseudophilosophy, which I will focus on here, is an academic enterprise, pursued primarily within the humanities and social sciences. I donâ€™t mean to suggest that the disciplines in question are <em>inherently</em> pseudophilosophical, only that, for some reason, a whole lot of pseudophilosophy goes on within them (although this will vary greatly between different universities and departments). Often philosophical issues are raised concerning knowledge, truth, objectivity, rationality and scientific methodology, and, again, without conscientious attention to relevant philosophical distinctions and arguments. A characteristic trait is a deferential attitude toward some supposedly great continental European thinker or thinkers, such as <span>G W F Hegel,</span> Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre (who might or might not have themselves been guilty of pseudophilosophy). Usually, the prose is infused with arcane terminology and learned jargon, creating an aura of scholarly profundity. We can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/theo.12047" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> this phenomenon obscurantist pseudophilosophy.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience is particularly prone to causal fallacies and cherry-picking of data, the most common fallacy in obscurantist pseudophilosophy is equivocation. This fallacy <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0392192112444984" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">exploits</a> ambiguities in certain key terms, where plausible but trivial claims lend apparent credibility to interesting but controversial ones. When challenged, the obscurantist will typically retreat to the safe house provided by the trivial interpretation of his claims, only to reoccupy the controversial ground once the critic has left the scene.</p>
<p>Let me <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9973.2005.00370.x" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">illustrate</a> how this works, focusing on <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-foucaults-work-on-power-is-more-important-than-ever" rel="noopener">Michel Foucault</a>, one of the central figures of French postmodernism. A central theme in Foucaultâ€™s writings is a critique of the notion of objective truth. Although there are controversies about interpretation, at least on the face of it Foucault maintains that truth is socially constructed and subject to ideological influence, and therefore not objective. However, his arguments for this claim focus entirely on the way in which what is assumed or believed to be true is influenced by what he refers to as â€˜powerâ€™. It is, of course, a plausible claim that our assumptions or beliefs are susceptible to ideological influence, especially in emotionally charged areas such as politics, but also in supposedly rational areas such as science. But Foucault doesnâ€™t explain how this rather mundane observation is supposed to imply or support the philosophically controversial claim that what is true, or which facts obtain (concerning the shape of the Earth, for example), is susceptible to ideological influence. Instead, by using the word â€˜truthâ€™ in an impressionistic fashion, the distinction between belief and truth is smudged over, allowing Foucault to make seemingly profound statements such as:</p>
<blockquote>[T]ruth isnâ€™t outside power, or lacking in power: contrary to a myth whose history and functions would repay further study, truth isnâ€™t the reward of free spirits, the child of protracted solitude, nor the privilege of those who have succeeded in liberating themselves. Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint.</blockquote>
<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to disambiguate this statement and see what remains.</p>
<p>This kind of fallacious critique of the notion of objective truth is a particularly pernicious aspect of obscurantist pseudophilosophy in general. Often, itâ€™s due to simple misunderstandings (such as confusing truth with belief or knowledge), but sometimes itâ€™s due rather to wilful obscurity (as in the case of Foucault).</p>
<p>Perhaps due to its aura of academic legitimacy and profundity, obscurantist pseudophilosophy is often used to give credence to dogmatic and bellicose political agendas, both on the Left and on the Right. Beyond that, it encourages confused and self-indulgent thinking in university students, and consumes vast resources that could be put to better use.</p>
<p>While pseudoscience can perhaps be counteracted by science education, the cure for pseudophilosophy is not science education but philosophical education. More specifically, it is a matter of developing the kind of basic critical thinking skills that are taught to undergraduates in philosophy. This doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy. Students should be taught things like learning to distinguish in a disciplined way between central philosophical concepts such as belief, truth, rationality and knowledge. They should be aware of the way ambiguities can be exploited by equivocating arguments, and become adept at how to spot other fallacies such as ad hominem and straw man. With these fundamental tools in hand, there would be a good deal less pseudophilosophy going around.</p></div></div></div>]]>

So, I'll just copy-paste relevant information here:</p><blockquote><p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p><p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p><p>As of December 2020 Python ranked third in TIOBE’s index of most popular programming languages, behind <code>C</code> and <code>Java</code>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html">docs.python: General Python FAQ</a> for answers to questions like "What is Python?", "What is Python good for?", "Why is it called Python?", etc.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#installation" id="installation">Installation</a></h2><p>On modern Linux distributions, you are likely to find Python already installed. It may be a few versions behind, but should work just fine for most of the topics covered in this book. To get the exact version used here, visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python downloads page</a> and install using the appropriate source for your operating system. Should you face any issues in installing, search online for a solution. Yes, that is something I expect you should be able to do as a prerequisite for this book, i.e. you should have prior experience with basic programming and computer usage.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/index.html">docs.python: What's New</a> to track changes across versions. As mentioned in the Preface chapter, <strong>3.9.0</strong> is the version used in this book.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#online-tools" id="online-tools">Online tools</a></h2><p>In case you are facing installation issues, or do not want to (or cannot) install Python on your computer for some reason, there are plenty of options to execute Python programs using online tools. Some of the popular ones are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">Repl.it</a> — Interactive playground. Code, collaborate, compile, run, share, and deploy Python and more online from your browser</li><li><a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">Pythontutor</a> — Visualize code execution, also has example codes and ability to share sessions</li><li><a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> — Host, run, and code Python in the cloud</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/">offical Python website</a> also has a <em>Launch Interactive Shell</em> option (<a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">https://www.python.org/shell/</a>), which gives access to a REPL session.</p><h2><a href="#first-program" id="first-program">First program</a></h2><p>It is customary to start learning a new programming language by printing a simple phrase. Create a new directory, say <code>Python/programs</code> for this book. Then, create a plain text file named <code>hello.py</code> with your favorite text editor and type the following piece of code.</p><pre><code># hello.py
print('*************')
print('Hello there!')
print('*************')
</code></pre><p>If you are familiar with using command line on a Unix-like system, run the script as shown below. Other options to execute a Python program will be discussed in the next section.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9 hello.py
*************
Hello there!
*************
</code></pre><p>A few things to note here. The first line is a comment, used here to indicate the name of the Python program. <code>print()</code> is a built-in function, which can be used without having to load some library. A single string argument has been used for each of the three invocations. <code>print()</code> automatically appends a newline character by default. The program ran without a compilation step. As quoted earlier, Python is an <em>interpreted</em> language. More details will be discussed in later chapters.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> All the Python programs discussed in this book, along with related text files, can be accessed from my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro/tree/main/programs">learnbyexample: 100_page_python_intro</a>. However, I highly recommend typing the programs manually by yourself.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#ide-and-text-editors" id="ide-and-text-editors">IDE and text editors</a></h2><p>An <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (IDE) might suit you better if you are not comfortable with the command line. IDE provides features likes debugging, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, code refactoring and so on. They also help in setting up <strong>virtual environment</strong> to manage different versions of Python and modules (more on that later).</p><p>If you install Python on Windows, it will automatically include <strong>IDLE</strong>, an IDE built using Python's <code>tkinter</code> module. On Linux, see if you already have the program <code>idle3.9</code>. Otherwise you may have to install it separately, for example, <code>sudo apt install idle-python3.9</code> on Ubuntu.</p><p>When you open IDLE, you'll get a Python shell (discussed in the next section). For now, click the <strong>New File</strong> option under <strong>File</strong> menu to open a text editor. Type the short program <code>hello.py</code> discussed in the previous section. After saving the code, press <strong>F5</strong> to run it. You'll see the results in the shell window.</p><p>Screenshots from the text editor and the Python shell are shown below.</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/hello.png" alt="hello.py program on IDLE editor"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/Python_shell_run.png" alt="Python shell example with output from an executed program"></p><p>Popular alternatives to IDLE are listed below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> — Python IDE for beginners, lots of handy features like viewing variables, debugger, step through, highlight syntax errors, name completion, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Pycharm</a> — smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick-fixes, automated code refactorings, rich navigation capabilities, support for frameworks, etc</li><li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a> — typically used for scientific computing</li><li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> — web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text</li><li><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> — community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of VSCode</li><li><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a> — text editors with support for syntax highlighting and more</li></ul><h2><a href="#repl" id="repl">REPL</a></h2><p>One of the best features of Python is the interactive shell. Such shells are also referred to as REPL, which is an abbreviation for <strong>R</strong>ead <strong>E</strong>valuate <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>L</strong>oop. The Python REPL makes it easy for beginners to try out code snippets for learning purposes. Beyond learning, it is also useful for developing a program in small steps, debugging a large program by trying out few lines of code at a time and so on. REPL will be used frequently in this book to show code snippets.</p><p>When you launch Python from the command line, or open IDLE, you get a shell that is ready for user input after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p><pre><code>$ python3.9
Python 3.9.0 (default, Dec  2 2020, 10:42:13) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre><p>Try the below instructions. The first one displays a greeting using the <code>print()</code> function. Then, a user defined variable is used to store a string value. To display the value, you can either use <code>print()</code> again or just type the variable name. Expression results are immediately displayed in the shell. Name of a variable by itself is a valid expression. This behavior is unique to the REPL and an expression by itself won't display anything when used inside a script.</p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('have a nice day')
have a nice day

&gt;&gt;&gt; username = 'learnbyexample'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(username)
learnbyexample

# use # to start a single line comment
# note that string representation is shown instead of actual value
# details will be discussed later
&gt;&gt;&gt; username
'learnbyexample'

# use exit() to close the shell, can also use Ctrl+D shortcut
&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
</code></pre><p>I'll stress again the importance of following along the code snippets by manually typing them on your computer. Programming requires hands-on experience too, reading alone isn't enough. As an analogy, can you learn to drive a car by just reading about it? Since one of the prerequisite is that you should already be familiar with programming basics, I'll extend the analogy to learning to drive a different car model. Or, perhaps a different vehicle such as a truck or a bus might be more appropriate here.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Depending on the command line shell you are using, you might have the <code>readline</code> library that makes it easier to use the REPL. For example, <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> arrow keys to browse code history, re-execute them (after editing if necessary), search history, autocomplete based on first few characters and so on. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline">wikipedia: GNU readline</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/readline">wiki.archlinux: readline</a> for more information.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> You can use <code>python3.9 -q</code> to avoid <em>version and copyright messages</em> when you start an interactive shell. Use <code>python3.9 -h</code> or visit <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html">docs.python: Command line and environment</a> for documentation on cli options.</p></blockquote><h2><a href="#documentation-and-getting-help" id="documentation-and-getting-help">Documentation and getting help</a></h2><p>The offical Python website has an extensive documentation located at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/">https://docs.python.org/3/</a>. This includes a tutorial, which is much more comprehensive than the contents presented in this book, several guides for specific modules like <code>re</code> and <code>argparse</code> and various other information.</p><p>Here's a couple of annotated screenshots:</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_1.png" alt="Python documentation: part 1"></p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/py_docs_2.png" alt="Python documentation: part 2"></p><p>Python provides a <code>help()</code> function, which is quite handy to use from the REPL. If you type <code>help(print)</code> and press the Enter key, you'll get a screen as shown below. If you are using IDLE, the output would be displayed on the same screen. Otherwise, the content might be shown on a different screen depending on your <code>pager</code> settings. Typically, pressing the <code>q</code> key will quit the <code>pager</code> and get you back to the shell.</p><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/help_print.png" alt="help print"></p><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/100_page_python_intro/images/info.svg" alt="info"> Quotes are necessary, for example <code>help('import')</code> and <code>help('del')</code>, if the topic you are looking for isn't an object.</p></blockquote><p>If you get stuck with a problem, there are several ways to get it resolved. For example:</p><ol><li>read/search for that particular topic from documentation/books/tutorials/etc</li><li>reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue</li><li>talk about the problem with a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc (see <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Rubber duck debugging</a>)</li><li>search about the problem online</li></ol><p>You can also ask for help on forums. Make sure to read the instructions provided by the respective forums before asking a question.

José Valim visits and finally publicly reveals what Project Nx is! He and others have been working on it for 3 months and he’s finally ready to unveil it. José will speak more about it at the LambdaDays conference, demonstrating it with code and announcing the release and availability of the OpenSource code.</p>
<p>Nx stands for “Numerical Elixir”. The Nx project brings a unique numerical mode to Elixir along with GPU support. This important work lays the foundation for a powerful new era with data science in Elixir! Listen in as Jose discusses the details of how this works, how it came about, the goals of the project, what this means for the community, and what comes next.

<p>A circle is a simple, convex shape, and the grid points are evenly spaced, so the number of points inside the
quarter circle will be roughly proportional to the area. More specifically, the fraction of all the grid points inside
the quarter circle will be roughly the area of the quarter circle divided by the area of square around all points. The

<p>The great ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes figured out the circle area over two thousand years ago without
integral calculus (or trigonometric functions for that matter). He started with an elegant insight about regular (i.e.,
equal-sided) polygons.</p>
<p>The famous <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI37.html">“half base times height”
formula for the area of a triangle already had a well-known proof in the first book of Euclid’s Elements of
Geometry</a> (easily derived from <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/propI35.html">a
theorem about parallelograms</a>). Conveniently, any regular polygon can be split into equal triangles joined to the
centre. For example, a regular hexagon splits into six triangles, as in the figure below. We can take any one of the
triangles (they’re all the same) and call the “base” the side that’s also a side of the polygon. Then the “height” is
the line from the centre of the base to the centre of the polygon.</p>

<p>Now here’s Archimedes’s neat insight: The ratio of the triangle area to the base is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<p>Of course, Archimedes was a respected mathematician who couldn’t get away with just assuming that anything true of a
polygon is true of a circle (counterexample: all polygons have bumpy corners, but circles don’t). He used the kind of
geometric proof by contradiction that was popular in his day. (He even took it further and analysed spheres, cylinders,
parabolas and other curved objects, almost inventing something like modern real analysis a couple of millenia early.)
Sadly, not all of his mathemetical work has survived, but <a href="https://flashman.neocities.org/ARCHCI1set.htm">the
key part of his Measurement of a Circle</a> has.</p>
<p>Here’s the high-level version. Archimedes claimed that the area of a circle is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>What are NFTs?</h3>
<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) is a term used to describe a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain, such as Ethereum. Assets that can be represented as NFTs range from digital goods, such as items that exist within virtual worlds, to claims on physical assets such as clothing items or real estate. In the coming years, we will see NFTs used to unlock entirely new use cases that are only made possible by crypto.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9799dae1-c2c9-4712-813b-10b23c279a36.jpeg" alt="Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora"></p><figcaption>Tokens redeemable for real world goods on Zora</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Ethereum ecosystem is where most NFT activity has taken place to date, NFTs can exist on other smart contract platforms too. This is because, at their core, NFTs are just digital abstractions used to represent assets that are one of a kind. Non-fungible token isn’t the most intuitive term since we don’t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases.</p>
<h3>Why are NFTs interesting?</h3>
<p>NFTs are powerful because, when combined with other financial building blocks on Ethereum, they allow anyone to issue, own, and trade them. This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don’t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable.</p>
<p>NFT activity can go well past trading and include actions like being able to borrow and lend, support fractional ownership (e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.com/">NIFTEX</a>), or use it as collateral in taking out a loan (e.g. <a href="https://nftfi.com/">NFTfi</a>). The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game <a href="http://aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a> combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user’s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a>, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/a1259686-6b61-455a-a204-f6e6da648f10.jpeg" alt="Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi"></p><figcaption>Aavegotchi gaming attributes change based on actions taken in DeFi</figcaption></figure>
<p>NFTs can cover an extremely wide variety of areas given they are simply digital representations of ownership but there has been significant growth within art and gaming in particular. Note that many digital works of art and gaming items are a subset of a larger category of NFT collectibles. There is also the emerging space of social tokens, which sometimes falls into the NFT category or that is closely related to it.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>NFTs can make fractionalized ownership more accessible, so if there is a valuable item that otherwise wouldn’t have been accessible for someone to own, now they can own a piece of it. Custody of a physical item still requires a trustworthy custodian, but being able to issue, hold, and trade it as a cryptoasset unlocks more use cases. One can also craft an NFT such that the creator receives a percentage of all secondary sales in a completely automated way. Artists typically don’t receive a cut of secondary sales in the traditional art world.</p>
<p>Programmable art is another interesting concept where a piece of artwork can incorporate on-chain data to dynamically update certain features or characteristics of the work. For example, one could create a piece of programmable art whose background changes if the price of ether goes above a certain dollar-value. There are countless creative possibilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is a digital art marketplace known for programmable art. Many artists on Async sell artwork where someone is able to own the “master” copy which consists of a number of individual layers, but other people can own the individual layers and adjust their attributes over time. Imagine groups of people being able to own art collectively, where members of the group manage attributes of the work.</p>

<p>A common question about digital artwork is what can you do with it? These works can be displayed in digital frames in a physical setting for people to enjoy. The digital artist Beeple sold physical tokens along with his digital NFTs and made <a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x6e5dc5405baefb8c0166bcc78d2692777f2cbffb/21">$3.5 million</a> from sales in an auction on the Nifty Gateway marketplace.</p>

<p>Digital artwork can also be displayed in online collections like a <a href="https://superrare.co/thevault/collection">SuperRare profile</a> as well as in virtual worlds. There are a number of art galleries within <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com/">Cryptovoxels</a>, a virtual world where users can buy and sell land parcels as NFTs. As virtual reality spaces become more popular, having digital art to display will become more common. This wouldn’t be much different than someone spending money on video game items to customize a character’s appearance, already a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>

<p>A common skepticism is that someone can just take a screenshot of the image or get a digital file so it’s not really scarce. However, the same argument could apply to physical items as well. Anyone can take a photo of the Mona Lisa or create a replica of it, but it isn’t the real item from the artist. People are willing to pay a premium for the original work. Another interesting aspect of digital art or collectibles is that you can easily verify the item’s ownership history. Some digital items might be worth more depending on who owned it in the past.</p>
<p>With NFTs, you can also prove that the item is real and tamper proof. This is an issue in the physical collectibles space. For example, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">T206 Honus Wagner baseball card</a> was sold to Wayne Gretzky for $451k and sold again for several million dollars. One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card’s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn’t change and there’s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAvLC3fz068&amp;">counterfeit Black Lotus</a> cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering. Common verification methods include bending the card to make sure it doesn’t crease or going through centralized grading services whose rating significantly affects the card's value.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>Steam, a popular video game platform, has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/?">Community Market</a> where in-game items can be bought and sold. Steam’s marketplace is centralized and collects a transaction fee of 5% for each item from the buyer. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2 take an additional fee of 10% for their items sold.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4ad85fcf-b986-4b60-9fb5-925200fde3a9.jpeg" alt="Steam Community Market"></p><figcaption>Steam Community Market</figcaption></figure>
<p>Steam also restricts user wallet balances to $2,000 and the price of a single item to $1,800. While these cases are outliers, many in-game items can actually sell for significantly larger amounts such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-11-06-dota-2-pink-war-dog-courier-sells-for-38-000.html">DotA 2 pink war dog courier</a> for $38,000. Within the crypto space there have also been high priced sales such as the $170,000 <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/09/05/most-expensive-cryptokitty/">CryptoKitty</a>. Similarly Magic: The Gathering’s coveted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/5/18251623/magic-the-gathering-black-lotus-auction-price">Black Lotus</a> card sold for $166,100. There is certainly demand for valuable in-game items. In decentralized marketplaces, there isn’t a limit imposed on what game items can be sold and for what amount.</p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces can significantly reduce transaction fees due to the improved efficiency of starting up and operating a marketplace. Marketplaces can also improve overall user experience and increase interest in the game. Hearthstone is a wildly popular digital collectible card game created by Blizzard Entertainment that had over <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hearthstone-has-over-100-million-players-1203019919/">100 million players</a> in 2018. Hearthstone opted to not have a marketplace for their cards which leaves opportunity for other digital collectible card games that allow for an open marketplace. <a href="https://godsunchained.com/">Gods Unchained</a> and <a href="https://www.skyweaver.net/">SkyWeaver</a> are two trading card games (TCGs) that have cards that are freely tradable. You are also able to earn cards as you level up in the game. Players that did not purchase packs of cards will still be able to improve upon the game’s default decks. It’s an exciting feeling knowing that the earned cards have real world value and can be sold or traded for other cards. Gods Unchained also lets users earn tokens for when they win a match or refer their friend. The tokens themselves unlock rare in-game items and are also freely tradable.</p>
<figure><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aa82c586-39b6-46b1-ae55-cb8a2e44c8e1.jpeg" alt="Gods Unchained"></p><figcaption>Gods Unchained</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the most popular games in crypto is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>. You battle with a team of pet Axies and level them up. There's no aspect of the gameplay that feels like a blockchain game but there is the added benefit of being able to openly trade the Axies on NFT marketplaces such as <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The game has become popular in the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nft-game-filipinos-covid">Philippines</a> and earning tokens from the game has become a viable source of income for players even <a href="https://www.playtoearn.online/2020/07/08/axie-infinity-beats-minimum-wage-in-many-countries/">beating minimum wage</a> in many countries. There is also a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> which leases Axies to players that want to get started with the game but don’t have the funds to purchase them. Several rare Axies were even <a href="https://www.delphidigital.io/reports/why-we-spent-159k-on-digital-battle-pets-2/">purchased</a> for $159,000 total.</p>

<p>There’s another popular game <a href="https://zkga.me/">Dark Forest</a> where you can explore different planets and collect Artifact NFTs on new planets, which give bonuses when attached to the planet. Being able to discover and collect these items or even win them in a battle and then trade them in decentralized marketplaces can make the game even more fun.</p>

<p>I fancied getting an eink screen to use for future projects. I bought a wee one with a raspberry pi “hat” attached. However, I realised later that I could maybe just re-purpose an old Amazon Kindle ebook reader.</p>



<p>I’ve messed with Kindles before, ages ago: I ported an <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/09/kif-an-infocom-text-adventure-interpreter-for-the-kindle/">Infocom interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://blog.lidskialf.net/2010/10/20/mangle-a-better-manga-reader-for-the-kindle/">Manga</a> reader to it. I managed to get Amazon’s own software to load them as “Kindlets” and show them integrated into their ebook reader. However, now I just want a nice cheap Linux based eink development platform.</p>



<p>Cheap Kindle From Ebay (and why)</p>



<p>So, off to ebay I went! I saw a number of really cheap ones marked “BLOCKED BY AMAZON”; I decided not to go for these since theoretically they might have been stolen. In the end, I went for £7 Kindle 4 “non-touch”.</p>



<p>A few days later, it turned up. And I discovered <em>why</em> it might have been so cheap: its stuck in some sort of unquittable demo mode:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1725" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_demo_mode/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg" data-orig-size="892,1239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_demo_mode" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=737 737w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=108 108w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=216 216w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_demo_mode.jpg 892w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px"></figure>



<p>I did some googling and although it seems later Kindle versions can be un-demo-mode-ed, nothing seemed to work for this version. I don’t actually care though; I don’t want to run the original Kindle ebook software on this.</p>



<p>So, the next step is to gain access. Browsing the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=166687">mobileread forums</a> showed it has a debug serial port: time to open the case!</p>



<p>Physical Access Granted!</p>



<p>This was kinda tricky! There are multiple clips all round it and the case is glued onto the battery compartment, so judicious application of a Big Knife was required to persuade it to let go. I cleaned the glue up with some Acetone.</p>

<ul><li>Red: annoying clips</li><li>Purple: <strong>really</strong> annoying glue.</li><li>Yellow: the serial port!</li></ul>



<p>As usual for this sort of thing, the serial port is missing its socket, so we need to solder onto the tiny contacts on the board. I like to use ~0.2mm wirewrap wire for this sort of thing, and the surface mount rework bit for my soldering iron:</p>







<p>I don’t want to leave any wires flapping about, but I also know at some point I’m going to screw up and need serial port console access, so I came up with a solution and attached it:</p>







<p>I superglued a piece of Veroboard onto the kindle’s PCB, then soldered wirewrap wires from the tiny PCB contacts onto one end. Finally, I soldered a larger, more conventional “Dupont” cable socket on the other end so I could easily attach and detach from it. Oh, the top cable on the Kindle PCB is 0v/GND, the others are TX and RX (I forget the order of those two).</p>



<p>Final hurdle: the kindle serial port runs at 1.8v, so I needed a serial port adaptor which supports that:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1737" data-permalink="https://blog.lidskialf.net/kindle_usbserial/" data-orig-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg" data-orig-size="545,828" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kindle_usbserial" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" src="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=545" alt="" srcset="https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg 545w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=99 99w, https://adq454703481.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/kindle_usbserial.jpg?w=197 197w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px"></figure>



<p>The one I bought does 5v. 3.3v, 2.5v, and 1.8v: it’s pretty neat!</p>



<p>Root Access Granted!</p>



<p>Next, I attached the serial adapter to my laptop, ran the <strong>minicom</strong> serial port software and rebooted the Kindle. Then, once I (inevitably) swapped the TX and RX wires around, I was greeted by this!</p>

Welcome to Kindle!

kindle login: </code></pre>



<p>Great, so that’s booting the uboot bootloader, then booting into linux and asking me to login.</p>



<p>Trying to login as root prompts for a password: Hmm… However, I already knew from previous Kindle stuff that you can generate the password from the serial number. I found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">this website</a> which generates a number of possible passwords for a specific device: Mine was the third on the list.</p>



<p>In case that site dies here’s the key snippet of Javascript:</p>



<pre><code>var md5 = hex_md5(serial);
document.getElementById("rootpw").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,11);
document.getElementById("rootpw2").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substring(7,10);
document.getElementById("rootpw3").innerHTML = "fiona" + md5.substr(13,3);</code></pre>



<p>Oh: I forgot to mention how I extracted the device’s serial number. Well, plugging it into USB doesn’t really “work”: you can’t mount these demo devices as disks. But, under linux, it still outputs the serial number in linux’s <strong>dmesg</strong> output (you can also get it using <strong>printenv</strong> in uboot if you press enter when it says “Hit any key to stop autoboot”):</p>



<pre><code>[128033.676587] usb 1-2: new high-speed USB device number 51 using xhci_hcd

</code></pre>



<p>Cool! We have root and can login! Now to figure out how to make it a bit easier to do stuff on it.</p>



<p>Dumping The System</p>



<p>First step is usually to dump the disks for analysis on another computer.</p>



<p>Checking <code>/proc/mounts</code> shows multiple partitions of the main disk on <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>.</p>



<p>Running <code>fdisk /dev/mmcblk0</code> gives the following:</p>



<pre><code>Units = cylinders of 64 * 512 = 32768 bytes

        Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
/dev/mmcblk0p1   *        1025       12224      358400  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p2           12225       14272       65536  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p3           14273       15296       32768  83 Linux
/dev/mmcblk0p4           15297       59776     1423360   b Win95 FAT32</code></pre>



<ul><li>So, four partitions, three linux, and one FAT32. </li><li>The first disk starts quite far into the disk: turns out the kernel is stored in that “missing” area. </li><li>Poking about a bit more shows partition 1 is the normal system, 2 is a sort of diagnostic tool partition, 3 is for storing internal private state of the kindle (eg wifi passwords). Finally, 4 is the one you see when you plug a kindle in over USB: its where your books would reside.</li><li>Partition 4 is mounted at /mnt/us.</li></ul>



<p>I dumped the start of the disk and partitions 1-3 onto /mnt/us using dd (I like to take a complete raw image if I can so I can restore it in case something goes wrong):</p>



<pre><code>dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/mnt/us/kindle.img bs=32768 count=15297</code></pre>



<p>Although this Kindle doesn’t show a disk over USB, since I have root, I can simply make it do it:</p>



<pre><code>rmmod g_file_storage
modprobe g_file_storage file=/dev/mmcblk0p4</code></pre>



<p>It popped up on my laptop so I copied everything off.</p>



<p>System Analysis</p>



<p>Finally, I mounted the partitions in kindle.img on my laptop with:</p>



<pre><code>kpartx -v kindle.img</code></pre>



<p>I could then mount the individual partitions on my laptop. I extracted all the files into a folder so I could poke around them and grep them easily. I figured out:</p>



<ul><li>It uses <code>rc.d</code> as its system init system, so there are lots of nice plain text scripts.</li><li>Init level 5 is the “normal” system running the ebook software</li><li>The ebook software is in <code>/opt/amazon</code> and is in Java (I kinda already knew this, but needed a quick refresher).</li><li>There’s a whole load of interesting plain text “diag” scripts for testing.</li><li>There’s a rather nifty <code>wifid</code> daemon for managing the wifi connection: I figured out how to talk to this from the diag scripts.</li><li>You can write to the eink screen from the command line using the <code>/usr/sbin/eips</code> command (<a href="https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Eips">docs here</a>).</li><li>I couldn’t find an obvious “turn off demo mode” switch: it appears the demo mode is a customised build of the Java ebook software.</li><li>The following system services are to do with unsupported features, the ebook software, or talking back to amazon: <code>S50wan S70wand S75phd S81usbnetd S93webreaderd S94browserd S95framework S96boot_finished</code>.</li></ul>



<p>Talking To Wifid</p>



<p>You can use the built in wifid to connect to wifi and manage your wifi profiles. Oh, also, remember many Kindles only support 2.4Ghz wifi when you wonder why it isn’t working 😉</p>



<p><strong>List number of WIFI profiles:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-get-prop com.lab126.wifid profileCount</code></p>



<p><strong>Show contents of a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index=(0)}" | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid profileData</code></p>



<p><strong>Delete a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid deleteProfile WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Create a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo '{essid="WIFIESSID", smethod="wpa2", secured="yes", psk="WIFIPSK"}' | lipc-hash-prop com.lab126.wifid createProfile</code></p>



<p>smethod can be one of open,wep,wpa,wpa2 (if you choose open, set secured to “no”)</p>



<p>WIFIPSK is the WIFI PSK as generated with the <code>wpa_passphrase</code> utility (which is actually on the kindle): a normal “wifi passphrase” will not work.</p>



<p><strong>Connect a WIFI profile:</strong></p>



<p><code>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.wifid cmConnect WIFIESSID</code></p>



<p><strong>Show WIFI connection status:</strong></p>



<p><code>echo "{index = (0)}" | lipc-hash-prop -n com.lab126.wifid currentEssid</code></p>



<p>Making Changes To Root</p>



<p>Many of the following instructions need to change the root disk on the kindle. However, by default it is mounted in read only mode, preventing modification. To fix, run this command on the kindle:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot rw</code></pre>



<p>When done, set it back to read only mode to prevent any unwanted changes:</p>



<pre><code>mntroot ro</code></pre>



<p>Installing Dropbear SSH</p>



<p>I wanted to be able to ssh into my kindle, so I needed to install the <a href="https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">dropbear</a> ssh daemon. Of course this is an ARM based device, so I either had to compile it myself or find it somewhere. Luckily …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>
