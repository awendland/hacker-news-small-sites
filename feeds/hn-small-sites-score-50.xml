<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>

<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<p>On <em>2020-12-06</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;E-Mail&quot;,&quot;E-Mail-Provider&quot;,&quot;Gerichtsurteil&quot;,&quot;LKA&quot;,&quot;Tutanota&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;,&quot;Ãœberwachung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/ct/ct-inhalt" width="300"></a-ad>



<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

Each application has to look exactly the same, with the same functionality - adding a todo item, marking an item as complete, removing completed items, etc. Every instance of the application needs to be persistent with local storage and feature routing for display all, active or completed todos, and so on. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-5ab1d"><span><span>Here is an example of a TodoMVC application:</span></span></p><div id="viewer-9kpfo"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5isi0"><span><span>In this article we share what we’ve learned from building a TodoMVC application using Stencil.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-7pffh"><span><span>Our finished copy of the complete Stencil TodoMVC application is on GithuB: </span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-2ajfe"><p><span>Github pages - </span><a href="https://yoavaa.github.io/stencil-todo-mvc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>demo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-504l8"><p><span>Github </span><a href="https://github.com/yoavaa/stencil-todo-mvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>repo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-6isa4"><p><span>Pull request for TodoMVC is </span><a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/2130" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>here</u></span></a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-df9em"><span><span>Here’s an equivalent React TodoMVC application for reference:</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-e9k4l"><p><a href="http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC React Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-ce1qk"><span><span>Just for the fun of it, we also added a </span><a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte</u></span></a><span> TodoMVC application for the performance comparison</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-acl7k"><p><a href="http://svelte-todomvc.surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte TodoMVC Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-8a90"><span><span>A side note on Svelte - that’s another framework we’ve considered in the past and one we’re following closely today.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.

<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>
