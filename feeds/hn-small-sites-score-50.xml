<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>I’ve been a software engineer a while now and I can say this with confidence - it is fun. It’s great and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It’s so much fun that some folks try to capture the most enjoyable elements and put them into games.</p>

<p>I’ve played two such games. The first is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/">Shenzhen.io</a></strong>. This one looks similar to what an engineer working on embedded devices would see. You solve puzzles by writing assembly code on low power devices. What makes this game great is that they remove the annoying parts of writing and shipping code.</p>

<ul>
<li>The requirements are clear, rarely true on the job.</li>
<li>The edit-debug-compile loop is lightning quick. That combined with a great test suite means you can try several potential solutions in a minute.</li>
<li>The platform your code depends on (the game itself) doesn’t have bugs. You don’t need to fix your dependencies before you start on your own code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should a software engineer play Shenzhen.io? The gameplay isn’t for everyone. For some people it feels too much “like work”. At the end of the day you want to relax, not work at tasks that feel similar to what you did for 8 hours. Despite that, I think it’s worthwhile just to see how much more fun a task becomes when the requirements are clear and developer tools are fast. Everyone knows that investing in our direction and our tools will help, but having fun playing this game reinforces that feeling.</p>

<!-- There's a great article about Shenzhen.io that I couldn't quite work in - https://probablydance.com/2016/11/07/lessons-learned-from-shenzhen-io/ -->

<p>The second game is <strong><a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a></strong> which released last Friday, though it has been available as an early access preview for about 4 years now. Those who’ve played it are probably scratching their heads right now - this is a game about building a factory, not coding. You work with conveyor belts, metals, oil products to craft products necessary to make a spacecraft.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqaAjgpsoW8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And yet, this game reminds me of software engineering more than any other. Let me explain why.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technical debt</strong>. Do we hack it for now or do we implement it right? The answer as always - it depends. Hacking it gets us closer to our goals right now but we have to pay off the debt eventually. Novice players (like me!) start out connecting various parts of our base by conveyor belts till our base resembles spaghetti, similar to poorly maintained codebases. Eventually we learn techniques to tame this complexity so our base/codebase becomes easier to reason about.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</strong>. One of those techniques is reducing duplication. If you have a component that’s needed in multiple places, do you make it once and use it everywhere or do you copy paste in each place it’s needed? The answer is “it depends”. As an engineer, sometimes you use a library while other times you copy paste. It depends on the complexity of the component - a couple of functions can be copy pasted while something complex probably shouldn’t. So it is in Factorio, a certain component (electronic circuits) was being produced in 4-5 places. I eventually replaced them all with one centralised production array to simplify the factory.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling</strong>. A repeated theme in this game is building a production array and later finding we need 3-5x the throughput. The first few times this happens, it requires redoing from scratch. After we wise up, we start design our arrays with space for scaling up. So it is with software - our systems need to scale to many more users, sometimes without much warning. We design our systems keeping that in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilding</strong>. When we’re rebuilding a component in a single player game or a personal software project we don’t usually care if the component or the whole system stops working briefly. I was playing multiplayer with friends though, so I tried to make sure components I was working on didn’t break anything else. I created a new oil refinery system, shifted existing customers to the new one before decommissioning the old one. Zero downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging</strong> to find root causes. Our factory is far from perfect, so something is always breaking as we add stuff to it. Finding the root causes of these issues is tricky, especially when fixing those leads to other problems, like playing whack-a-mole. An example from yesterday - We don’t have enough electricity, so we add more boilers, but now the water pipes need fixing. Then the water is fine, but we don’t have enough coal. That mirrors real life</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>. Most things are possible solo given enough time. But it’s quicker and more fun working with a team you like. We were able to move fast by splitting responsibilities among the team. We have one oil guy (me), one trains guy, one secretary of defense, among other roles. The others don’t care about the internals of the refinery system, just the interface - they use the outputs and let me know if it’s broken. It’s the same on large software projects - everyone can’t learn the intricacies of the whole system. Instead everyone learns the APIs of all components while a few are responsible for the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Researching</strong>. We spend most of our time exploiting our existing knowledge to keep us in our local maxima of output. However, a smart player dedicates some time to learning new techniques. In our game, coal power wasn’t working out for us and I had dismissed nuclear power as an option because we didn’t have enough uranium ore. I looked into it again when we were desperately short of power and producing too much pollution. Turns out even a little ore is enough to power the base for a 100 hours if we do it right. It’s the same with software - our existing stack probably works well, but it’s smart to see what’s out there and possibly learn from others. New team mates can help here too - everything is new to them so they’re spending more time than you on learning. They can come across stuff that we didn’t know about and use that knowledge to find a higher maxima. A fresh pair of eyes is always good.</li>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>. You can do most things manually, it just takes time. But if you’re doing something repeatedly, it should be automated. The game gently eases you towards this idea by requiring a few items be automated. It gets better later in the game you unlock construction robots. You can tell them the layout of the production array you’ve designed, give them the materials and they will construct it for you. This reminded me of AWS CloudFormation and similar tools - although it’s possible to set up servers by hand, it’s quicker and less error prone to specify the end state and let a tool do it for us. But if you’ve developed software, you know that automation isn’t just a means to an end - it’s an end in and of itself. We do it because it makes us happy, even if we do too much of it and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">forget what we were doing in the first place</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Putting out fires</strong>. Sometimes it’s hard to implement new features because we’re being pulled away to deal with alerts - all too common on software engineering teams. The typical solution is to have one team member deal with alerts while the rest focus on adding features. That’s we did in the game too.</li>
</ul>

<p>But more than any one thing, the game is about managing complexity. Designing a specification and implementing systems that fulfill that specification. Maintaining and growing that system over time.</p>

<p>IMO, playing Factorio will not make you a better software engineer. But if you’re a software engineer, you’ll likely find the game fun. And conversely, if you’re good at the game you should give software engineering a shot.</p>

<p>You can get Factorio at on the <a href="https://factorio.com/">official website</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Steam</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://factorio.com/download">free demo</a>, in case you’d like to try before you buy. (Just one thing - don’t wait for a sale. This game has never gone on sale and possibly never will.)</p>

		If you're around my age, you'll remember Windows Minesweeper. It was one of several games included with Windows back in the day to try to train users in the use of the then-newfangled â€˜mouseâ€™. It doesnâ€™t come with Windows any more. You can get Minesweeper for Windows 10, but the developers haveâ€¦ made some choices.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you havenâ€™t played it, Minesweeper is a grid of squares, some of which have mines underneath, and your job is to click on all the others. If you click on a mine, you lose. You can also flag squares with the right mouse button to record that you think they are a mine. Your only clue as to where the mines are is that when you click on a square that isnâ€™t a mine, it tells you how many of the eight adjacent squares are mines. If that number is zero, the game automatically clicks on all the adjacent squares for you so you can get a little patch to start from. Hopefully that will include a 1 in a tight corner so thereâ€™s only one place its mine can go, and that will complete a nearby 1 so you can get some more numbers to work from, eventually leading you to complete the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If youâ€™re not so lucky, you might not get a solvable board. A common situation is that you get down to the last two spaces and you know one of them is a mine but thereâ€™s no wat to predict which one. You have to guess. Heads you win, tails you just wasted 10 minutes carefully clearing the whole board only to be scuppered by a forced guess.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/mines.html">Thereâ€™s a version of Minesweeper that guarantees you never have to guess</a>, which is very nice. It neatly solves the problem of unwinnable games, and while I find that always knowing you can make a deduction can be too big a clue, in regular Minesweeper you could even lose straight off the bat â€” you have to guess the first move and maybe itâ€™ll be a mine. In this case, Windows Minesweeper quietly chooses a different arrangement of mines and pretends like you got lucky after all â€” but it doesnâ€™t do that if youâ€™re stuck at the <em>end</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what if we went further? Below is a version of Minesweeper where you will <em>never</em> be penalised when forced to guess. Any time there simply isnâ€™t enough information to deduce a safe move, weâ€™ll pull Windowsâ€™s trick and quietly rearrange the mines so you donâ€™t get penalised.
	</p>
	<p>
		But since that would on its own make the game too easy, the flip side of this coin is that if you <em>can</em> in theory deduce a safe move but guess anyway, the code will quietly rearrange the mines so that your unnecessary risk backfires and you lose.
	</p>
	<p><label>Width </label>
		<label>Height </label>
		<label>Mines </label>
		
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This game is also rigged to give you a zero on your first click rather than simply a non-mine space. To be honest this is mostly to avoid situations that are computationally difficult â€” this is not what I would call carefully optimised code. If I wanted to expand this I would (eg) make it precalculate things while youâ€™re staring at the screen instead of waiting for you to choose a square and then trying to work out what to do about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		More importantly, I would like to make the game recognise when thereâ€™s a forced guess _coming_ â€” currently if thereâ€™s a 50/50 chance in one corner of the grid that youâ€™re clearly going to have to take eventually, you have to wait until thatâ€™s <em>all</em> there is. If you take the chance when there was a safe space available elsewhere, youâ€™ll always lose.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I was feeling especially mean, I could insist that the player choose the square with the best odds of being safe, rather than simply judging whether or not each square is theoretically knowable. But I think that would be taking things too far.
	</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!-- .entry-header --><div><p>Recently I migrated this website over to WordPress.org. I tried to set it up so I could use my WordPress site with Github Pages. This post details the tribulations I faced while doing so. Here are the different sections; feel free to skip around however you like:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href="#backstory">The backstory: my previous setup and why I switched</a></li><li><a href="#requirements">Requirements for a new solution</a></li><li><a href="#mistakes">Two big initial mistakes</a></li><li><a href="#warning">A warning (because hindsight is 20/20)</a></li><li><a href="#run-locally">The treacherous journey to run WordPress locally</a></li><li><a href="#annoying-issues">More annoying issues I faced</a></li><li><a href="#is-it-working">Finally, it’s working?</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion">The Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#postscript">Postscript: I’m never satisfied and here are a few more things about WordPress that I’m annoyed with</a></li></ol><h2 id="backstory"><strong>The backstory: my previous setup and why I switched</strong> to WordPress</h2><p>Prior to WordPress, I had a nice set up with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (static site generator) and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github/Github Pages</a> (hosting &amp; serving). I liked this old setup because it was simple and free. I also liked Jekyll’s plain, minimal look. Jekyll’s visual style is very barebones and that’s exactly what I wanted.</p><p>My old workflow for editing and publishing posts was simple. I’d open a text editor, write a post in Markdown, and build and run my website locally to test the changes. Next, I’d push the new post to Github, where I’d re-deploy my website with the changes.</p><p>I first started to get annoyed with this setup when I had to re-remind myself how Jekyll glued together and rendered my site each time I wanted to publish a post. I got even more annoyed when I wanted to make changes to the layout. For example, I tried and failed multiple times to add a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag to the head of my <code>index.html</code> file. This theoretically should have been a very simple change.&nbsp;</p><p>If this happened once or twice, I’d be fine with it. The bigger problem is that the purpose of my website is to encourage me to write more. I started to procrastinate writing because there was always some small thing I wanted to fix with Jekyll first. Then, when I made time to tinker around with Jekyll, I was annoyed that I spent more time doing that than actually writing.</p><h2 id="requirements"><strong>Requirements for a new solution</strong></h2><p>So, I decided to make it was time to change my setup. My new setup had to fulfill just two requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>Easy content management. </strong>I really like the idea of just writing something, editing it, and then hitting a button to publish it once it’s ready. I didn’t like diving into Ruby files just to fix configuration issues, deploy issues, UI issues, etc. (what was happening with Jekyll).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be a writing first experience. </strong>I’ve never quite liked writing in text editors. Something about it just doesn’t <em>feel</em> right, though I can’t put my finger on exactly what.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I decided to go with WordPress because it seemed like it fulfilled both of those requirements really well. Also <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> is free, unlike Webflow and Ghost, two alternatives I considered that are both quite pricey ($20/month for Webflow and $29/month for Ghost) and loaded with a bunch of features I don’t need yet.</p><h2 id="mistakes"><strong>Two big initial mistakes</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, previously I used Github/Github Pages to host and serve my website. Github was free and worked great, so I wanted to rig up my WordPress setup to also use Github and Github Pages.&nbsp;</p><p>The only requirement to use Github Pages is that your site has to be static. Some light Googling showed me that there were a few plugins that converted WordPress site files to static pages. There were even <a href="https://www.hywel.me/static/site/wordpress/2016/07/17/fast-free-static-website-with-wordpress-and-github-pages.html">a few tutorials</a> describing how to do this, so I was confident this would be possible. That was my first big mistake.</p><p>Next, I began figuring out how to get WordPress to run locally. That was my second big mistake. My logic here was simple. Previously with Jekyll, I’d run my website locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of my website to Github to redeploy it. Thus, if I wanted to use WordPress with Github and Github Pages, then I should run my WordPress site locally, add my changes, and then push the new version of the site to Github.&nbsp;</p><p>While this logic wasn’t bad, I really should have tested the core assumption that it relied on first (the fact that the WordPress site <em>could</em> be converted into a static website). Or I should have done a bit more research than just some “light Googling” before venturing into a solution and stubbornly refusing to give up.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="warning"><strong>A warning (because hindsight is 20/20)</strong></h2><p>Here’s what I know now: running WordPress locally is a nightmare. Successfully figuring it out was way harder than it should have been. If you’re trying to do this yourself, don’t. You most likely don’t need to, and there’s probably another solution you can use to get to what you want.&nbsp;</p><p>(I should also caveat that I know almost nothing about Apache, MySQL, FTP, and PHP. If you’re familiar with them, then you might not have the same issues. However, I really don’t think I should have needed to learn about all of those technologies just to set up WordPress locally.)</p><h2 id="run-locally"><strong>The treacherous journey to run WordPress locally</strong></h2><p>First, I downloaded WordPress.org and installed it locally. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/installing-wordpress-on-your-own-computer/">official WordPress installation page</a> implied that I also needed some combination of Apache, MySQL, and PHP. A few of the links on that page were broken, a red flag that I promptly ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>I read a few other tutorials and subsequently downloaded and installed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/">XAMPP</a>, making sure to include Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin in the installation. I opened up XAMPP and pressed the “Start Application” button. That took me to an error page.</p><p>I clicked through some XAMPP tabs and pressed a few more buttons that started Apache, MySQL, and ProFTD. Now pressing “Start Application” took me to an XAMPP page. This seemed promising, but I still got an error page when trying to access my WordPress site which should have been running locally.</p><p>I bopped around a bit more and figured out that I had to enable local forwarding in XAMPP on an available port. I roll my eyes and question why XAMPP is so difficult to use.</p><p>Now that I could <em>see</em> my WordPress site locally, I still couldn’t do anything (e.g. create post). I learned that I needed to create a database locally via phpMyAdmin. Again, this is something that should have been easy, but the interface SUCKED. I had such difficulty performing such a simple action. I mean…just look at it:&nbsp;</p><figure><img width="1024" height="544" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" alt="phpMyAdmin home screen" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1024x544.png 1024w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-768x408.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-1536x817.png 1536w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-2048x1089.png 2048w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.01.03-PM-600x319.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin home screen</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img width="1022" height="486" src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" alt="bad database creation UI" srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png" data-srcset="https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM.png 1022w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-300x143.png 300w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-768x365.png 768w, https://www.melissadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-15-at-10.02.19-PM-600x285.png 600w"><figcaption><em>phpMyAdmin “Create Database” page</em></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at these screenshots now makes me annoyed all over again.</p><h2 id="annoying-issues"><strong>More annoying issues I faced</strong></h2><p>I then ran into some issues that took me a long time to figure out. Surprisingly, there was not a lot of advice out there on good solutions. I spent more time than I’d like to admit on WordPress support forums and arcane blogs. I’ll include the two most annoying issues here for posterity and in the event that another poor soul is also sifting through Google searching for a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #1: “to perform the requested action WordPress needs to access your web server”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, add <code>define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );</code> to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p><p><strong><em>Annoying error #2: fix the file and folder permissions error in WordPress / “installation failed could not create directory”</em></strong></p><p>To fix this, you need to give XAMPP write access to the local directory you have WordPress set up in. I spent awhile messing around with quite a few config files (like .htaccess) and FTP permission codes to no avail. The solution was ultimately simple: right-click on your local WordPress directory, click “Get Info”, scroll to “Sharing &amp; Permissions”, and change the permissions on your directory to “Read and Write (anyone)”.</p><h2 id="is-it-working"><strong>Finally, it’s working?</strong></h2><p>At long last, all of this is finally working and I now have WordPress running locally.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, the next step is to install a plugin to convert my site into a bunch of static pages. I go with <a href="https://www.simplystatic.co/">SimplyStatic</a>, the most popular and highly recommended plugin to do this.</p><p>I immediately run into quite a few errors with SimplyStatic. After progressively resolving each one, I ultimately run into one I can’t fix. I search some more and realize that it’s because SimplyStatic was only compatible with an earlier version of WordPress than the one I was running. I dig further and realize that the plugin hasn’t been updated for over two years. And there don’t seem to be <em>any</em> currently updated plugins that do this conversion. Epic FAIL.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t want to sink in even more time to learn how to convert the WordPress PHP files into static pages. I decided to cut my losses right there and abandon ship.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="conclusion"><strong>The Conclusion</strong></h2><p><strong><span>TL;DR? Don’t try to run WordPress locally, and don’t try to use WordPress with Github Pages to host and serve it. It won’t work.</span></strong></p><p>I ultimately ended up going with <a href="http://siteground.com/">Siteground</a> for managed hosting. Siteground’s interface is awful, but after poking around a bit I got most of it set up. I had a few minor configuration issues when enabling HTTPS and spent ~30 minutes chatting with a customer support agent, who was actually quite helpful.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="postscript"><strong>Postscript: I’m never satisfied and here are a few more things about WordPress that I’m annoyed with</strong></h2><ol><li>Unless you want your WordPress site to look bad or just like everyone else’s, you’ll probably want to customize an existing theme to your own liking. <strong>To do this, you’ll still need to hack around with code<em> </em></strong><em>(in this case, a combination of HTML, CSS and PHP)</em>. Theoretically, you could probably install a plugin to help you do this, but that’d probably slow down your site and further obscure how things actually work.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting used to WordPress itself was a bit of a curve. The main dashboard, for instance, is completely useless to me. I’ve just been ignoring all parts of the interface I don’t need, which thus far has been working pretty well.&nbsp;</li></ol><hr><p>If you liked this post, add your email address below to stay updated whenever there’s a new one.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Most WebAssembly tutorials and examples you will find online focus on using it inside the browser in order to accelerate various functionality of a website or web app.<br>
However, there is an area where WebAssembly is really powerful but not talked too much about: outside the browser usage scenarios. That is what we’ll focus on in this series of posts.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What is WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>Web people are on a roll of giving bad names to things (web-gpu is another example).<br>
WebAssembly is neither web or assembly, but a bytecode that can be targeted from languages like C++, C#, Rust and others. This means you can write some Rust code, compile it into WebAssembly and run that code in a WebAssembly virtual machine.</p>

<p>This is powerful because you won’t have to deal with garbage collected scripted languages anymore, and essentially use Rust or C++ as your <em>scripting language</em>.  WebAssembly enables predictable and stable performance because it doesn’t require garbage collection like the usual options (LUA/JavaScript).</p>

<p>It’s a relatively new product and there are a lot of rough edges, especially for out-of-browser scenarios. One of the roughest ones in my experience has been documentation for out-of-browser scenarios and this is the reason for my blog posts, to document my findings and hopefully help some people that may be interested in this subject.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-we-want-to-run-webassembly-outside-of-a-browser">Why would we want to run WebAssembly outside of a browser?</h2>
<p>For out of browser scenarios, one of its main advantage is that it provides system level access without compromising on security. This is done through WASI, the Web Assembly System Interface. <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> is a collection of C-like functions that provide access to functionality such as <code>fd_read</code>, <code>rand</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, threads (WIP), in a safe way.</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios where you would be able to use web-assembly outside of a browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A scripting language for a video game.</li>
  <li>To run some code with minimal overhead as Fastly/Cloudflare are doing with their compute-at-edge scenarios.</li>
  <li>To run some easy to update code on IoT devices safely and with minimal runtime overhead.</li>
  <li>Extreamly fast programs in environments where you can’t JIT for <em>reasons</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For the best experience in this adventure, I suggest using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as your IDE and install the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>rust-analyzer</code>: for autocomplete and other great features.</li>
  <li><code>Code-LLDB</code>: For debugging with LLDB (even works on Windows)</li>
  <li><code>WebAssembly by the WebAssembly foundation</code>: Allows you to disassemble and inspect <code>.wasm</code> binaries.</li>
</ul>


<p>First you need a Virtual Machine (VM) that can run your WebAssembly program. This VM needs to be embeddable, so you can add it in your game engine, or what we will call from now on <strong>host program</strong>. There are a few to pick from: <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">WASM3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime">WAMR</a>, and many others. They have various characteristics, such as supporting JIT, using as little memory as possible and so on and you have to choose one one that fits your target platform and scenario.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter too much what VM you’re choosing besides runtime properties, with the exception of debugging. The only VM that allows for a seamless debugging experience that I’ve found is Wasmtime (this is another one of those rough edges). So even if you don’t plan on deploying that anywhere due to other constraints, I suggest using it as the <strong>debug VM</strong>. Whenever you’d want to debug some WASM code you can launch it with Wasmtime.</p>



<p>First, we need to create a new <code>lib</code> project:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>cargo new <span>--lib</span> wasm_example
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <code>Cargo.toml</code> add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can edit <code>lib.rs</code> and export the following <code>C</code> FFI compatible function from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span><span>;</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"From WASM: Sum is: {:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
    <span>s</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This a function that takes two numbers, adds them, then prints the result before returning their sum.<br>
WebAssembly doesn’t define a default function that’s executed after a module is loaded, so in the host program you need to get a function by it’s signature, and run it (quite similar to how <code>dlopen</code>/<code>dlsym</code> works).</p>

<p>We expose this <code>sum</code> function (and any other functions we want to call from the host VM) as a function that’s callable from <code>C</code>, using <code>[#no_mangle]</code> and <code>pub extern "C"</code>. If you’re coming here from some WASM for the browser tutorials, you may notice we don’t need to use <code>wasm-bindgen</code> at all.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-compile-it">How do we compile it?</h2>
<p>Rust supports two targets for WebAssembly: <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> and <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. The first one is bare-bones WebAssembly. Think of it like the <code>[#no-std]</code> of WebAssembly. It’s the kind you’d use for the browser that doesn’t assume any system functions are available.</p>

<p>At the other end, <code>wasm32-wasi</code> assumes that the VM exposes the <code>WASI</code> functionality, allowing a different implementation of the standard library to be used (the implementation that depends on the WASI functions to be available).</p>

<p>You can take a look at the available implementations for the Rust’s stdlib here: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys</a>  <br>
This is the implementation that assumes WASI functions are available to the rust program when running in a WebAssembly VM: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/library/std/src/sys/wasi</a>.</p>

<p>To comile for wasm32-wasi run:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># Run this just once</span>
rustup target add wasm32-wasi

<span># Compile for the wasm32-wasi target.</span>
cargo build <span>--target</span> wasm32-wasi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="but-how-does-println-work">But how does <code>println!()</code> work?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we’re calling <code>println!()</code> and expecting the program to work and print to the console, but how does a WebAssembly program knows how to do that?</p>

<p>This is why we’re using <code>wasm32-wasi</code>. This target selects for the rust stdlib the version that assumes some functionality to be there (the <code>WASI</code> functions). Printing to the console means just writing to a special file descriptor. Most VMs allow that by default so we don’t need to do any special settings, besides compiling the correct <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target.</p>

<p>If you have installed the required extensions for vscode, you can now right click on <code>target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code> and select <code>Show WebAssembly</code> and you should have a new file open in vscode that looks like this:</p>

<p>This is a <code>wat</code> file. <code>wat</code> stands for WebAssembly text format. It’s kind of like looking at x64/ARM ASM instructions when disassembling a binary, just uglier and harder to understand. I have read that this was because the creators of WebAssembly couldn’t decide on a text format so they just left it in this ugly s-expression form.</p>

<p>The import statements here tell us that the WASM program needs the following functions <code>proc_exit</code>, <code>fd_write</code>, <code>environ_get</code>, <code>environ_sizes_get</code> to exist in the <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> namespace.<br>
All imported or exported functions from a WebAssembly module require a namespace. <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1</code> is the WASI namespace so you can think of it as a reserved namespace for these functions. <code>println!</code> needs <code>wasi_snapshot_preview1::fd_write</code> to write to stdout.</p>

<h2 id="the-host-program">The host program</h2>
<p>You can pick any VM that has WASI available. I will use Wasmtime because later on I want to show you how to debug WebAssembly and this VM is the only one where debugging works at the moment.</p>

<p>The program loads the wasm binary file from the path: <code>examples/wasm_example.wasm</code>.<br>
This is the file you have previously compiled that you can find in <code>wasm_example/target/wasm32-wasi/debug/wasm_example.wasm</code>. <strong>Make sure you move it in the right place before running the host program.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the full listing of the host VM rust program that initializes the Wasmtime VM, loads the module, links against WASI and loads and executes the exported <code>sum</code> function from the WASM module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>;</span>

		<p><em>If you enjoy this article, please check out my free book by clicking <a href="https://deponysum.com/2020/03/30/something-to-read-in-quarantine-essays-2018-to-2020/">Here: “Something to Read in Quarantine: Essays 2018-2020.”</a></em></p>
<p id="b9a9">Natural Language Processing (NLP) per Wikipedia:</p>
<p id="34cf">“Is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.”</p>
<p id="7dd8">The field has seen tremendous advances during the recent explosion of progress in machine learning techniques.</p>
<p id="b5f8">Here are some of its more impressive recent achievements:</p>
<p id="cb15"><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;The Winograd Schema is a test of common sense reasoning- easy for humans, but historically almost impossible for computers- which requires the test taker to indicate which noun an ambiguous pronoun stands for. The correct answer hinges on a single word, which is different between two separate versions of the question. For example:</p>
<p id="512d"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.</em></p>
<p id="ece3"><em>The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.</em></p>
<p id="0ddf">Who does the pronoun “They” refer to in each of the instances?</p>
<p id="d33c">The Winograd schema test was originally intended to be a more rigorous replacement for the Turing test, because it seems to require deep knowledge of how things fit together in the world, and the ability to reason about that knowledge in a linguistic context. Recent advances in NLP have allowed computers to achieve near human scores:(<a href="https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/</a>).</p>
<p id="0a43"><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;The New York Regent’s science exam is a test requiring both scientific knowledge and reasoning skills, covering an extremely broad range of topics. Some of the questions include:</p>
<p id="a36d"><em>1.Which equipment will best separate a mixture of iron filings and black pepper? (1) magnet (2) filter paper (3) triplebeam balance (4) voltmeter</em></p>
<p id="9797"><em>2. Which form of energy is produced when a rubber band vibrates? (1) chemical (2) light (3) electrical (4) sound</em></p>
<p id="966a"><em>3. Because copper is a metal, it is (1) liquid at room temperature (2) nonreactive with other substances (3) a poor conductor of electricity (4) a good conductor of heat</em></p>
<p id="6d70"><em>4. Which process in an apple tree primarily results from cell division? (1) growth (2) photosynthesis (3) gas exchange (4) waste removal</em></p>
<p id="3a8a">On the 8th grade, non-diagram based questions of the test, a program was recently able to score 90%. (&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01958.pdf</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p id="2f49"><strong>C)</strong></p>
<p id="267a">It’s not just about answer selection either. Progress in text generation has been impressive. See, for example, some of the text samples created by Megatron:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053.pdf</a></p>
<p id="b8f7"><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p id="db13">Much of this progress has been rapid. Big progress on the Winograd schema, for example, still looked like it might be decades away back in (from memory) much of 2018. The computer science is advancing very fast, but it’s not clear our concepts have kept up.</p>
<p id="1a6c">I found this relatively sudden progress in NLP surprising. In my head- and maybe this was naive- I had thought that, in order to attempt these sorts of tasks with any facility, it wouldn’t be sufficient to simply feed a computer lots of text. Instead, any “proper” attempt to understand language would have to integrate different modalities of experience and understanding, like visual and auditory, in order to build up a full picture of how things relate to each other in the world. Only on the basis of this extra-linguistic grounding could it deal flexibly with problems involving rich meanings- we might call this the multi-modality thesis. Whether the multi-modality thesis is true for some kinds of problems or not, it’s certainly true for far fewer problems than I, and many others, had suspected.</p>
<p id="5a4d">I think science-fictiony speculations generally backed me up on this (false) hunch. Most people imagined that this kind of high-level language “understanding” would be the capstone of AI research, the thing that comes after the program already has a sophisticated extra-linguistic model of the world. This sort of just seemed obvious- a great example of how assumptions you didn’t even know you were making can ruin attempts to predict the future.</p>
<p id="f943">In hindsight it makes a certain sense that reams and reams of text alone can be used to build the capabilities needed to answer questions like these. A lot of people remind us that these programs are really just statistical analyses of the co-occurence of words, however complex and glorified. However we should not forget that the relationships between words are isomorphic to the relations between things- that isomorphism is why language works. This is to say the patterns in language use mirror the patterns of how things are(1). Models are transitive- if x models y, and y models z, then x models z. The upshot of these facts are that if you have a really good statistical model of how words relate to each other, that model is also implicitly a model of the world.</p>
<p id="12db">It might be instructive to think about what it would take to create a program which has a model of eighth grade science sufficient to understand and answer questions about hundreds of different things like “growth is driven by cell division”, and “What can magnets be used for” that wasn’t NLP led. It would be a nightmare of many different (probably handcrafted) models. Speaking somewhat loosely, language allows for intellectual capacities to be greatly compressed. From this point of view, it shouldn’t be surprising that some of the first signs of really broad capacity- common sense reasoning, wide ranging problem solving etc., have been found in language based programs- words and their relationships are just a vastly more efficient way of representing knowledge than the alternatives.</p>
<p id="1e8b">So I find myself wondering if language is not the crown of general intelligence, but a potential shortcut to it.</p>
<p id="beea"><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p id="0095">A couple of weeks ago I finished this essay, read through it, and decided it was not good enough to publish. The point about language being isomorphic to the world, and that therefore any sufficiently good model of language&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a model of the world, is important, but it’s kind of abstract, and far from original.</p>
<p id="e0e2">Then today I read&nbsp;<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this report</a>&nbsp;by Scott Alexander of having trained GPT-2 (a language program) to play chess. I realised this was the perfect example. GPT-2 has no (visual) understanding of things like the arrangement of a chess board. But if you feed it enough sequences of alphanumerically encoded games- 1.Kt-f3, d5 and so on- it begins to understand patterns in these strings of characters which are isomorphic to chess itself. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it develops a model of chess.</p>
<p id="1a14">Exactly how strong this approach is- whether GPT-2 is capable of some limited analysis, or can only overfit openings- remains to be seen. We might have a better idea as it is optimised — for example, once it is fed board states instead of sequences of moves. Either way though, it illustrates the point about isomorphism.</p>
<p id="a87a">Of course everyday language stands in a woolier relation to sheep, pine cones, desire and quarks than the formal language of chess moves stands in relation to chess moves, and the patterns are far more complex. Modality, uncertainty, vagueness and other complexities enter but the isomorphism between world and language is there, even if inexact.</p>
<p id="b6c0"><strong>Postscript- The Chinese Room Argument</strong></p>
<p id="f901">After similar arguments are made, someone usually mentions the Chinese room thought experiment. There are, I think, two useful things to say about it:</p>
<p id="3d7e">A) The thought experiment is an argument about understanding in itself, separate from capacity to handle tasks, a difficult thing to quantify or understand. It’s unclear that there is a practical upshot for what <em>AI can actually do.</em></p>
<p id="1f79">B) A lot of the power of the thought experiment hinges on the fact that the room solves questions using a lookup table, this stacks the deck. Perhaps we be more willing to say that the room as a whole understood language if it formed an (implicit) model of how things are, and of the current context, and used those models to answer questions? Even if this doesn’t deal with all the intuition that the room cannot understand Chinese, I think it takes a bite from it.</p>
<p id="96a9">— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>
<p id="4642">(1)- Strictly of course only the patterns in true sentences mirror, or are isomorphic to, the arrangement of the world, but most sentences people utter are at least approximately true.</p>

that I threw together: <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86"><em>steg86</em></a>. It uses a quirk of the
x86 instruction encoding format to hide messages in pre-existing binaries with no size or

<h2 id="a-quick-steganography-refresher">A quick steganography refresher</h2>

<p>Steganography is the practice of concealing data within other data. A variety of different
common formats open themselves up to steganographic channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Image formats: using the least significant bits of the color space</li>
  <li>Audio formats: hiding information in background noise, or hiding an image
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrogram</a></li>
  <li>Plain text: using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homographs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner">special spacing characters</a> to encode information</li>
</ul>

<p>On its own, steganography is <em>not</em> a replacement for cryptography: it’s strictly
obfuscatory, and does not provide any deniablity of the embedded message if revealed.</p>

<p>That being said, there exist a variety of use cases for steganographic schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coupled with strong cryptography, they <em>do</em> allow for deniability: depending on the format,
an extracted message can be made indistinguishable from random noise prior to decryption.</li>
  <li>Steganography can be used for fingerprinting and asset management.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code">Commercial printers</a> are well-known for doing this;
video games have also used it to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/steganography_i_1.html">track users and their machines</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="doing-steganography-on-computer-programs">Doing steganography on computer programs</h2>

<p>There are two obvious avenues for doing steganography on compiled programs. <em>steg86</em> does
<strong>neither</strong> of these, but for the sake of completeness:</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-program-via-the-compiler">Instrumenting the program via the compiler</h3>

<p>Compilers perform instruction selection to lower their internal representations into machine code.
Instruction selection can be informed by any number of weights, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register pressure</a>, individual instruction
performance (clock cycles, use of shared units), and feature availability
(e.g., selecting an older version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a>
to be compatible with more CPUs).</p>

<p>In this approach, the steganographer would control the compiler and its instruction selection
weights, encoding information in particular selections of instructions (or other parts of
code generation, like stack object order).</p>

<p>This affords a great deal of flexibility and control, but also makes it more difficult for the
compiler to perform optimal selections. It also requires the steganographer to maintain
their (forked) compiler. Not a bad idea, but requires a decent amount of effort.</p>

<h3 id="instrumenting-the-container-format">Instrumenting the container format</h3>

<p>Another approach is to ignore the compiled instructions themselves, and focus on the binary
container: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O">Mach-O</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable">PE</a>, among others.</p>

<p>These formats afford many opportunities for embedding information: the order
(both file and virtual address) of segments and sections, the order and layout
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_(computing)">relocation tables</a> and the composition of
their internal rules, and so on.</p>

<p>Instrumenting the binary format rather than the executable code means not having
to muck with instruction selection, but is also less bountiful in terms of
information density. It’s also not portable, e.g. tricks for hiding information
in ELF relocation entries would have to be tweaked for PEs.</p>

<h2 id="how-steg86-works">How <em>steg86</em> works</h2>

<p>Instead of controlling instruction selection or tweaking the details of the containing binary
format, <em>steg86</em> takes a third route: it uses the presence of <em>semantic duals</em> in the x86 and AMD64
instruction formats to selectively rewrite a program <em>after</em> compilation.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-duals">Semantic duals</h3>

<p>Like every ISA, x86 (and AMD64) have multiple ways to encode the semantics of a particular
(higher level, conceptual) operation. For example, clearing a register:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor'ing a register with itself clears all bits</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; and'ing a register with 0 also clears all bits</span>
<span>and</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; we could also set 0</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>

<span>; ...or subtract</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>eax</span>

<span>; ...or load a "computed" address that's always 0</span>
<span>lea</span> <span>eax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…among many others. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work exactly as we’d like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each of these alternatives may have a different length when encoded, e.g. 2 bytes for
<code>xor eax, eax</code> versus 6 for <code>lea eax, [0]</code>. Consequently, rewriting one in terms of another
might entail a length change and subsequent relocation and displacement fixups.</li>
  <li>Each of these alternatives has subtle microarchitectural differences: they set and clear
different arithmetic flags, have different implicit segmentation behavior, and so on.
We don’t know perfectly whether the original operations took advantage of those details,
so many of our potential alternatives run the risk of subtle breakage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, this is <strong>not</strong> what <em>steg86</em> does.</p>

<p>Instead, <em>steg86</em> takes advantage of one of the quirks of the x86 instruction encoding: the ModR/M
byte:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/modrm.png" alt="The ModR/M byte."></p>

<p>The ModR/M byte is normally used to encode one or more explicit register and/or memory operands
to an opcode<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>: it’s how x86 can supply the rich range of source-to-sink modes that it has
(register-to-memory, memory-to-register, register-to-register, immediate-to-register, &amp;c).</p>

<p>Because register-to-memory and memory-to-register are both valid source-sink combinations for
many opcodes, many have encoding forms like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>; xor register with register/memory32 and store register/memory32</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span><span>,</span> <span>r32</span>

<span>; xor register/memory32 with register and store register</span>
<span>xor</span> <span>r32</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>/</span><span>m32</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Consequently, there are actually <strong>two</strong> ways to encode <code>xor eax, eax</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; r/m32, r
31 C0

; r, r/m32
33 C0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These encodings are <em>semantic duals</em>: they have different opcodes, but belong to the same
instruction family, have the same length, and have the <em>exact same behavior and performance</em>.
We could replace every occurrence of <code>31 C0</code> with <code>33 C0</code> and our programs would happily chug along,
none the wiser.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there are actually quite a few of these duals on some of the most common
x86 instructions<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ADD r/m8, r8   &lt;=&gt; ADD r8, r/m8

<p>Each dual represents one bit of information: we can arbitrarily assign one form
to be <code>true</code> and its counterpart to be <code>false</code>. Given enough of them in a target
program, we can hide a message by translating between the forms. The result:
a binary that’s exactly the same size as the original and with the same performance
characteristics, but with a hidden message.</p>

<p>That’s all <em>steg86</em> does: it locates every semantic dual in its target program, maps
its input message to a bitstring, and translates each dual depending on its corresponding
message bit. Because it only uses duals, it’s completely agnostic to its containing format:
the <code>steg86</code> CLI currently supports ELF, Mach-O, and PE/PE32+ binaries.</p>

<p>Here’s what that actually looks like, with (some of the) differing bytes highlighted in red:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/steg86_vbindiff.png" alt="vbindiff between bash and steg'd bash"></p>

<p>And, of course, try it for yourself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>steg86 profile /bin/bash
Summary <span>for</span> /bin/bash:
  175828 total instructions

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/steg86/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for prior work and
future refinements to <em>steg86</em>’s informational capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: An important note: because compilers and assemblers tend to select just one of the forms
above, <em>steg86</em> <strong>cannot</strong> provide deniability, even with strong encryption. Its transformations
will always look abnormal compared to a compiler-produced binary.</p>

            <h3>Body Weight Has Surprising, Alarming Impact on Brain Function</h3> 
			<h4>Higher BMI is linked to decreased cerebral blood flow, which is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and mental illness, according to a new study in JAD</h4>		</p><div> 
						            		
						<p>
							<em>August 5, 2020</em><br>
							<strong>Amsterdam, NL and Costa Mesa, CA, USA – As a person's weight goes up, all regions of the brain go down in activity and blood flow, according to a <a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200655" target="_blank">new brain imaging study</a> in the <em><a href="http://j-alz.com/" target="_blank">Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</a></em>. One of the largest studies linking obesity with brain dysfunction, scientists analyzed over 35,000 functional neuroimaging scans using single-photon emission computerized tomography from more than 17,000 individuals to measure blood flow and brain activity. </strong>
						</p><p>Low cerebral blood flow is the #1 brain imaging predictor that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease. It is also associated with depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, addiction, suicide, and other conditions. “This study shows that being overweight or obese seriously impacts brain activity and increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease as well as many other psychiatric and cognitive conditions,” explained Daniel G. Amen, MD, the study’s lead author and founder of Amen Clinics, one of the leading brain-centered mental health clinics in the United States</p>

<p>Striking patterns of progressively reduced blood flow were found in virtually all regions of the brain across categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity, and morbid obesity. These were noted while participants were in a resting state as well as while performing a concentration task. In particular, brain areas noted to be vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease, the temporal and parietal lobes, hippocampus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and precuneus, were found to have reduced blood flow along the spectrum of weight classification from normal weight to overweight, obese, and morbidly obese.</p>

<p>Considering the latest statistics showing that 72% of Americans are overweight of whom 42% are obese, this is distressing news for America’s mental and cognitive health.</p>
<p>Commenting on this study, George Perry, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of the <em>Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease</em> and Semmes Foundation Distinguished University Chair in Neurobiology at The University of Texas at San Antonio, stated, “Acceptance that Alzheimer’s disease is a lifestyle disease, little different from other age-related diseases, that is the sum of a lifetime is the most important breakthrough of the decade. Dr. Amen and collaborators provide compelling evidence that obesity alters blood supply to the brain to shrink the brain and promote Alzheimer’s disease. This is a major advance because it directly demonstrates how the brain responds to our body.”</p>
<p>This study highlights the need to address obesity as a target for interventions designed to improve brain function, be they Alzheimer disease prevention initiatives or attempts to optimize cognition in younger populations. Such work will be crucial in improving outcomes across all age groups.</p>
<p>Although the results of this study are deeply concerning, there is hope. Dr. Amen added, “One of the most important lessons we have learned through 30 years of performing functional brain imaging studies is that brains can be improved when you put them in a healing environment by adopting brain-healthy habits, such as a healthy calorie-smart diet and regular exercise.”</p>

<p>The original AKAI MPC 3000 Classic released in 1994 as the step up from its predecessor, the MPC 60 (and the later MPC 60 mkII). MSRP was staggering, coming in at just under $4,000 in the early 90’s (a little over $7,000 in today’s money). It was clear that this machine was meant for professional studios and intended to be a tool for deliberate music applications.</p>

<h2>History of the AKAI MPC 3000</h2>



<h3>Roger Linn</h3>



<p>In 1980 Roger Linn designed and released the worlds first drum machine that uses samples called the LM-1, under his own company Linn Moffett Electronics with then partner Alex Moffett. Eventually Linn Electronics went out of business and the next chapter would be Roger Linn and Akai Professional linking up to create new products. The collaboration was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer and Roger Linn wasn’t a fan of the manufacturing aspects of the business. In 1988 they would release the Akai MPC 60 and later followed by the updated MPC 60 MKII. In 1994 came the release of the MPC 3000, the celebrated upgrade from the MPC 60 line.</p>



<h3>MPC 60 vs MPC 3000</h3>



<ul><li>MPC 60: 12 bit audio – MPC 3000: 16 bit audio.</li><li>MPC 60 has 750KB of stock memory, expandable to 1.5 MB. The MPC 3000 has 2 MB of stock memory, expandable up to 32 MB.</li><li>The MPC 60 only has a single mono sampling input, while the MPC 3000 has dual stereo inputs.</li><li>MPC 60 has no filters whle the MPC 3000 comes equipped with a lowpass filter.</li><li>Both sound slightly different from eachother. Some prefer the 60, others prefer the 3000.</li></ul>



<p>Roger Linn’s vision for what a drum machine could be revolved around <em>grooves</em>. A drum machine had to have great groove to it. So he wanted it to be simple and be able to record exactly what you threw at it. This required the timing to be super tight in the MPC 3000. Linn made sure all the details were figured out for this on the backend and the result is a machine that grooves perfectly.</p>

</div><figcaption>Roger Linn talks about the AKAI MPC 3000.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hip-hop took an immediate kinship to the machine. Early notable users were producers like DJ Quik, Battlecat, Dr. Dre and J DIlla. The creation of the drum machine sampler ushered in innovation to a musical artform that was previously based around two turntables. The innovation of the sampler elevated the artform to a new frontier. Roger Linn himself has said that he did not anticipate this.</p>



<blockquote><p><em><span><b>”The AKAI MPC simultaneously </b></span><strong>digitized beat-making, progressed the pastiche musical form, and freed Hip-Hop from the confines of earlier technology.”</strong></em></p><cite><a href="https://happymag.tv/in-praise-of-the-akai-mpc-a-hip-hop-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HappyMag.Tv</a></cite></blockquote>



<h3>J Dilla</h3>



<p>J Dilla started to make a name for himself in the mid 90’s with classic records like Pharcyde’s “Runnin”, Janet Jackson’s “Got Til It’s Gone”, and Q-Tip’s “Breathe &amp; Stop”.</p>

<p>Out of Dilla’s music also spawned the R&amp;B sub-genre Neo-soul. Also connected to the MPC 3000 through J Dilla’s work.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that nobody else has displayed the MPC 3000’s groove capablities better than J Dilla. He was turning off the quantize setting during a time when literally everybody was relying on quantization for electronic music creation. He approached the MPC 3000 like a drummer would, and in turn he is regarded as one of the best drum programmers of all time.</p>

<h3>Dr. Dre</h3>



<p>After the release of the landscape-changing album <em>The Chronic 2001</em> in 1999 by Dr. Dre, more of the public started to take strong notice of the machine. Dr. Dre stated in an interview with Scratch Magazine that he used four or five different MPC 3000’s at one time for the creation of the album to avoid the drawbacks of using disks and memory. He shared that during this time his beats were layed down with the drums in the 3000 first, and everything else revolving around that.</p>

<h2>Interesting Facts About the MPC 3000</h2>



<ul><li>There are no visual waveforms. You chop on the MPC 3000 with numbers, editing the start and end time of samples with numerical digits. Others would argue that you can chop by individually sampling each chop.</li><li>There is no EQ or FX in the MPC 3000. Only a lowpass filter and attack/decay, and delay.</li><li>You can only cutoff 2 other pads per pad. Compare this with modern drum machines where you can apply choke groups, etc. and cutoff any pad.</li></ul>



<h2>Why The MPC 3000 Is The Best Drum Machine of All Time</h2>



<p>To put it plainly, the simplicity.</p>



<p>Even though technically an MPC is a computer, the ushering in of personal computers as we know them today, and the fast innovation simply changed how music was being made. Workflow started to shift from unmanageably short sample times to hoards of collections of samples on hard drives. Modern workflow now allows freely auditioning any sized samples and endless decisions to be made with endless tools at your fingertips, effectively debilitating creativity very easily.</p>



<p>If Roger Linn had not been the first to incorporate sampling into drum machines, and then successfuly iterate on it leading into the release of the 3000, its safe to say that Hip-Hop and House music would not have taken it under their wing and catapulted the machine into the history books in the way that its heralded as a classic machine and musical instrument.</p>



<p>When you take a step back, its easy to realize that the 3000 was really where things peaked for drum machines. The MPC 3000 knocked it out of the park where it mattered most…. The sound, the timing, and the workflow. Drum machines that came after the MPC 3000 started to offer new abilities and functions, but traded them for things like the beefy analog sound and streamlined workflow.</p>



<p><strong>The Timing</strong></p>



<p>When you talk to fans of the MPC 3000, you hear them talk about “The Feel.” They will tell you that the feel of the 3000 is like no other drum machine or sampler that exists. This is due to the timing that Roger Linn built into the machine. The timing on the MPC 3000 is extremely tight and about as true as you can get. It will record exactly what you play. Essentially, it is the essense of what a “groovebox” is.<br>The sequencer on the MPC 3000 is second to none.</p>



<p><strong>The Sound</strong></p>



<p>Theres something about the sound of the MPC 3000. It’s the sampling engine, but it also seems to be more than that. For drums, while subtle… enthusiasts will tell you its unmatched. While the sampling engine will color sounds in its own way, the 3000 also seems to have a unique glue which provides subtle punch. Sounds will jump off of the track and manage to coexist beautifully on the 3000.</p>



<p><em>The low end on the MPC 3000 is amazing.</em></p>



<p>The MPC 3000 is very bottom heavy and thick in sound. Roger Linn has talked about how they tried to make it sound like a tape machine. And it clearly does. You can drive this machine extremely hot and loud without ever losing any bottom end.</p>



<p>You can’t really get a computer or any DAW to sound like an MPC 3000. Some claim its a matter of boosting the low end, and cutting some of the high end frequencies to match the sound of the 3000. This is simply false. There are much more nuances happening that have yet to be achieved on a computer… mostly the digitial to analog conversion. The DAC on the MPC 3000 is extremely unique. It’s a machine and it sounds like a machine, in a good way. In the best way possible.</p>



<p><strong>The Workflow</strong></p>



<p>The workflow is unmatched. It’s minimal, but it also gives you the proper buttons for only the functions and screens that you need. </p>



<p>The addition of a number pad is brilliant and is extremely useful allowing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A question I often hear from teams - both new and established - is “should we host our stack on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>?”.  Given all the buzz it gets in the tech world a lot of people assume&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with k8s for several years - often with very powerful and complex platforms - and I think the truth is more&nbsp;nuanced.</p>
<p>Here’s my attempt at untangling that decision.  It’s geared toward startups and self-sufficient teams in wider organisations with responsibility for hosting their own products.  It might also have value to people in more traditional <span>IT</span> departments at larger&nbsp;organisations.</p>
<h3>How Can it Help&nbsp;Me?</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t just a 2018-era buzzword.  It’s a robust, highly scalable system that allows you to construct application deployments out of well-considered primitives (<code>Pod</code>, <code>Service</code>, <code>Ingress</code> etc) then does its damnedest to make the reality match.  When applications crash it restarts them.  When whole swathes of underlying machines disappear it tries to replace them.  If you’re running numerous services (probably developed as a microservice architecture) and you’re looking for efficiency, resilience and a good story for deployment it can do a lot for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Want a basic degree of resilience in your service? (yes you do) - run <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/">multiple replicas</a> in your deployment then balance traffic between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>If your workload is ‘bursty’ (e.g. a lot of <span>API</span> traffic) you could build on this by rigging up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">autoscaling</a> to grow capacity when it’s needed.  This can save you a lot of money - instead of paying for peak capacity all of the time, provision a baseload amount to keep the platform ticking over and bring up more replicas when they’re needed.  And if you can <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/custom-and-external-metrics">import the queue length</a> into your system autoscaling works for queue-based workloads&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Worried about your code breaking?  Configure liveness/readiness <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">probes</a> and Kubernetes will automatically restart your services when they fail.  Likewise for hardware failure - I’ve seen clusters who’ve lost half their nodes keep on trucking like nothing happened.  A well-configured and maintained Kubernetes cluster can be incredibly robust.  If you have the resources you might even try running a <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/">chaos-monkey</a>-like <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/chaos-monkey/chaos-monkey-alternatives/kubernetes/">tool</a> to make certain your stack will tolerate regular&nbsp;failures.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has excellent features for integrating with your <span>CI</span> workflow.  The most common pattern I see for this is a build (ideally standardised across all your projects) that pushes an image to a Docker registry then kicks your k8s cluster to load it.  Depending on taste that can be done by modifying the deployment to pull a new tag, or pointing the tag to the new image and triggering k8s to reload all pods.  In most cases (migrations ruin everything) deployment can be fully automated: if you trust your tests and feature flags it can be 100% automatic (aka <a href="https://www.continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a>); for the less brave a manual approval step after the build eases the pain.  Either way your developers should be able to release most builds to the cluster without any help from Kubernetes&nbsp;specialists.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to <span>CI</span> it can help you standardise logging and monitoring for your applications.  Doing this is by no means unique to Kubernetes, but having a single cluster-wide system that gathers together data about all your services in the same place can greatly ease the pain of debugging.  I’ve seen particularly good results come from using <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset">fluentd</a> to pipe json-structured logging output from applications into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/"><span>AWS</span> CloudWatch</a> and query it through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html">Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Finally it can do a great deal to increase efficiency - both at the hosting layer (i.e. jamming as many applications onto those expensive <span>EC2</span> instances as possible) and also reducing the time your developers need to spend deploying software.  Humans cost more than computers so for most organisations the second of these will be the biggest win.  But Kubernetes isn’t magic - I’ve seen some beautiful, efficient clusters and some total gas guzzlers.  <em>You’ll only save money with Kubernetes if you invest in using it&nbsp;correctly.</em></p>
<h3>Where Does Kubernetes&nbsp;Shine?</h3>
<p>First of all think about your workload.  What kind of applications do you need to run?  How do they talk to each other and the outside world?  From experience I’d say the following attributes make your stack a good&nbsp;fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly speaking have you followed a microservice architecture?  There’s little value in Kubernetes if your world only has one application.  You’ll need to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/">Dockerize</a> your applications to deploy them to k8s; doing this from day 1 of any project is a good way to make yourself think about the boundaries between&nbsp;services.</li>
<li>Are your services exposed to each other and the outside world via <span>HTTP</span>(s) (probably yes, it’s 2020)?  This will fit k8s’ model nicely and you can use one of the normal <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controllers</a> to front&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Are your applications suitable to be load balanced?  No local state (use PostgreSQL / Redis / whatever for that), communication over known endpoints, fast startup/shutdown.  That isn’t to say you can’t keep shortlived state like a Redis cache in your cluster but for many cases you’d do better to use the boxed services a cloud provider&nbsp;offers.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is also well suited to headless applications like batch processing (through its <code>Job</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/">controller</a>) and long-lived&nbsp;queue-consumers.</li>
<li>Is memory (and to a lesser extent <span>CPU</span>) usage predictable?  Kubernetes will try to host your applications on the same physical machines, so if one of them goes haywire and consumes all the <span>RAM</span> other workloads may be randomly killed.  In my experience this is the single biggest source of instability on Kubernetes clusters.  If you understand the resource usage of your applications you can declare a <code>resources.requests</code> and <code>resources.limits</code> to guarantee they’ll always get the memory they need and won’t be bad&nbsp;neighbours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely here are a few kinds of workload I <em>don’t</em> think you should use it&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static websites.  Typically you’d do this by baking your content into an <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/">Nginx</a>-derived image and exposing it via your cluster’s ingress controller.  That’s a terrible way to host static content: all those little copies of Nginx need to be maintained, it’s inefficient and far less resilient / performant than it could be at the network level.  Sure you could stick it behind a <span>CDN</span> but if you’re doing that, why not have a cloud service host the content as&nbsp;well?</li>
<li>Hosting untrusted code.  That could mean applications supplied by your customers or third party code with a history of security problems, e.g. Wordpress or a dodgy library from <span>NPM</span>.  By default Kubernetes’ features for isolating workloads aren’t great.  You can add things like <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> to control network access but it’s easy to screw up and your security model is always going to be 100% dependent on the container runtime.  The default for this (Docker, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">Linux cgroups</a>) offers a huge attack surface to compromised applications: if a codebase your cluster is running gets hacked an attacker will not find it hard to escalate their access to the rest of the cluster.  Interesting work is being doing on alternatives to cgroups (e.g. <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a>) but it’s not yet mainstream enough to recommend to the average&nbsp;user.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workload isn’t a good fit you may still have options for shoehorning it into Kubernetes (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/">volumes</a> can be used for long-lived state), but expect to spend a lot of engineering time working around the problems.  A lot of them are bad practices anyhow so your resources time might be better spent designing them out of the stack altogether - they’re only going to hurt you further down the&nbsp;line.</p>
<h3>No Magic&nbsp;Bullet</h3>
<p>Kubernetes isn’t a magic bullet.  It can help to move the complexities of hosting applications into a well-designed layer of their own but it won’t make them go away.  You’re always going to have to secure and maintain your&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>To make a cluster useful for the average workload a menagerie of add-ons will be required.  Some of them almost everyone uses, others are somewhat niche.  Examples include (the Nginx <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">ingress controller</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler">cluster-autoscaler</a> to add extra nodes when you don’t have enough capacity.  Having a bespoke set of software operating key features of the environment makes your cluster a unique snowflake and it needs to be managed as such.  Also they need to be updated regularly and can sometimes be of questionable quality.  Configuration management tools like <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> or <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Terraform</a> are nigh-on mandatory: tinker with a cluster by hand at your peril, absent a declarative setup you’ll never be able to spin up another in exactly the same way.  I’ve seen this lead to no end of problems when operating or replacing more mature&nbsp;clusters.</p>
<p>When running any nontrivial stack on Kubernetes a degree of curation is always going to be required.  Letting anybody deploy whatever they like, however they like to your cluster can only lead to chaos.  You’ll end up with mess of inconsistently named applications scattered across dozens (or worse, one) namespaces with nobody knowing how they fit together.  Congratulations: you took your old spaghetti infrastructure and replaced it with a new flavour of spaghetti infrastructure, just served on a cooler kind of&nbsp;plate.</p>
<p>The most successful Kubernetes implementations I’ve seen are those where infrastructure specialist(s) work with developers to make sure workloads are well-configured, standardised, protected from one another and have defined patterns of communication.  They’ll handle the initial setup of an application on an infrastructure, hopefully wired up to a build/release system so dev teams can ship new versions of the code without help.  In a lot of ways this mirrors the wider culture of your organisation - if engineering is a chaotic free-for-all of bad communication and ill-defined responsibilities your hosting environment will mirror it.  At best this leads to unreliability; at worst an unreliable, unmaintainable, expensive&nbsp;mess.</p>
<h3>Cost of&nbsp;Ownership</h3>

	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

          <p>I worked at Amazon for 17 years as a network engineer. Now I’m out of Amazon and looking at the industry, I’m learning new things. <strong>One of the things I’ve learned recently is that OSPF shouldn’t be used for Clos leaf-spine networks because of scale.</strong> I’ve heard that it can’t keep up with the size and scale of the modern datacenter networks. <a href="https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/topics/task/configuration/ip-fabric-underlay-cloud-dc-configuring.html">Juniper IP Fabric Underlay Network Design and Implementation</a> is an example of the recommendation.  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938</a> is what as used as the reference for using eBGP to be the routing protocol inside of large Clos networks.</p>

<p><strong>This is a shock to me</strong> since we built large OSPF Clos networks a decade ago. We built networks this way with hundreds of routers (even thousands) speaking OSPF. I’m not saying it is easy or that we didn’t have to understand OSPF well; If you don’t design it well, you get a flooding disaster. But if you do set it up right, it works really well. It converges quickly and doesn’t collapse under failure. The key thing is to be sure you understand how flooding works and you focus on areas and summarization. There are different things you have to be aware of when you are designing a Clos network with BGP vs OSPF. With BGP you have to be figure out how to mitigate path hunting. With OSPF need to work on how to avoid congestion collapse.</p>

<p>There is also work on building new protocols for these large Clos or Clos-like networks, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rift/documents/</a>. I don’t understand why OSPF or ISIS isn’t good enough so I don’t understand why these are necessary. There <a href="https://pc.nanog.org/static/published/meetings/NANOG74/1763/20181003_Martin_Routing_In_Dense_v1.pdf">are some good ideas in RIFT</a>, I’m just haven’t seen a reason to use it.</p>

<p>When we did this we were using CPUs from 2003 and we were using a lesser known OSPF stack. It’s OSPF implementation was okay, but we were strongly warned away from using their BGP implementation by the developers. <strong>We had to understand and mitigate risk</strong>. We had to test it as well as we could and be very careful in our first deployments. The stack had never been battle tested like this before. We still ran into some scary performance issues but got to work with great software engineers on the protocol stack to work through problems and figure out our scale.</p>

<p>Others agree with me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmvg2mnbcPg</a>, even though they are mostly focusing on smaller networks than I was working on. But either way, OSPF can be made to work just fine on very large (or small) Clos networks.</p>

<p>As an example of the scale, this is a generic 24 port 3-tier Clos. It is possible to make OSPF work on this. This is smaller than what we were working on in 2012.
<img src="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/assets/images/24port-3tier-clos-resize.png" alt="24 port 3-tier clos"></p>

<p>To understand and then mitigate the risks an unknown OSPF stack, at scale, is why I started building a configuration management system and started <a href="https://elegantnetwork.github.io/posts/Network-Validation-with-Vagrant/">simulating our network design</a>. We needed to understand how any OSPF protocol stack would work. Could we make the protocol scale at all? We needed to see what would actually happen with a real OSPF implementation. <strong>I cannot stress enough how important this simulation was.</strong> We did not understand the problem of flooding and we did not understand the solution until we had tried it out in simulation.</p>

<p>Before that, though, we spent a lot of time on white boards arguing about topology and OSPF. <strong>I think whiteboards are the most important tool for network design</strong> currently available, which makes me sad. I wish that wasn’t true, I want much better tools. I can’t even tell you the number of disasters averted by 2-3 great network engineers arguing over a whiteboard. This works really well, but there are important reasons it’s not good enough. One is that for many of these discussions, it’s extremely hard to get data to make the decisions. In this case, a comparison of convergence time and failure detection in a 3-tier Clos with eBGP, iBGP, and OSPF should be required, but we didn’t have that capability.</p>

<p>In a dense mesh-like network such as a Clos network, the concerns around OSPF swirled around four main issues: the effect of flooding, the size of the link state database, the speed of SPF calculations, and the ability for OSPF to carry a large number of prefixes. We were concerned about OSPF scaling w.r.t. its flooding and it’s the flooding that is expensive with a Link State Database protocol, not the Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations. Which means you have to be very careful about what is flooded, what are the areas, and how things are summarized. I didn’t understand this until I had a simulation and I could try things out with areas or without, and the effect was dramatic. I think it’s often true that there is a part of a design that you don’t understand, which is one of the big reasons to do simulation. We didn’t have the ability to lab up a network as big as we were going to be building, so the simulation was critical. I can’t even imagine what we would have done without it. Based on the simulation, we created targeted tests for real hardware to understand how it would deal with the scale.</p>

<p>The point of this article is not that OSPF is better than BGP, but that it does work in very large size Clos networks. I’m frustrated that so much of the industry went a direction without great data or analysis, just following one set of opinions and design choices. <strong>I wish there were easy ways for people to be able to design, simulate and test different designs</strong> like this so that they could decide for themselves the tradeoffs they’d like to make, rather than have to rely on some type of industry hype. There needs to be a better way to be able to describe topologies and designs so that it’s really easy to try out different ideas.</p>

<p>If you have other considerations, such as you want to run IPv6, or EVPN, a single instance of eBGP such as the one popularized by the open source routing suite, FRR, maybe the simplest or elegant. But with proper design, scale is not the reason to use BGP over OSPF. If you are running a small Clos network and don’t have IPv6 or EVPN, OSPF is more straightforward and generally faster, as was the common practice before the advent of BGP in the data center.</p>

<p>No matter what, you need to understand the choices that you are making and understand the tradeoffs. This is hard to do, and especially hard in networking because we lack design patterns and good tools to help us understand the implications of our choices.</p>

<p>If anybody knows about tools or design patterns or even somebody who’s actually compared OSPF vs BGP in Clos networks with data, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

          <p>Languages are often judged initially on their "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello,
world!</a>" program.
How easy is it to write? To run? How easy is it to understand? It's a very
simple program, of course, one of the simplest, even... just produce a little
text, and display it, what could be simpler?</p>
<p>It's really not fair to judge a language by such a cursory impression, but it
<em>can</em> give you an idea of what a language <em>values</em> and how it works. What does
the syntax look like? Is it typed? Is it interpreted? You can usually tell a
lot at a glance.</p>
<p>For example, One of Ruby's (many) hello worlds is so simple, it's also Python!</p>
<pre><code>print(<span>'Hello world!'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Often, people coming from interpreted languages experience compiled, systems
languages to be more complicated right off the bat. There is the obvious added
complexity of compiling and running being separate steps, as opposed to simply
pointing an executable at some source code and seeing a result right away, but
there are often syntactical constructs to go along with that...</p>
<p>At first glance, Rust's hello world looks fairly inert, as well:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() {
    <span>println!</span>(<span>"Hello World!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>println!</code> is actually a macro, what does it look like expanded?</p>
<pre><code><span>macro_rules!</span> println {
    () =&gt; ($crate::<span>print!</span>(<span>"\n"</span>));
    ($($arg:tt)*) =&gt; ({
        $crate::io::_print($crate::format_args_nl!($($arg)*));
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice that this <em>also</em> has a macro <em>inside of it.</em> This matches on the
second case (because there is an argument present) and calls into
<code>$crate::format_args_nl!</code> and passes the result of that to <code>$crate::io::_print</code></p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>_print</span></span>(args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) {
    print_to(args, &amp;LOCAL_STDOUT, stdout, <span>"stdout"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>which calls into <code>print_to</code>, which looks like</p>
<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>print_to</span></span>&lt;T&gt;(
    args: fmt::Arguments&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;,
    local_s: &amp;<span>'static</span> LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;<span>Box</span>&lt;<span>dyn</span> Write + <span>Send</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,
    global_s: <span><span>fn</span></span>() -&gt; T,
    label: &amp;<span>str</span>,
) <span>where</span>
    T: Write,
{
    <span>let</span> result = local_s
        .try_with(|s| {
            
            
            
            <span>let</span> prev = s.borrow_mut().take();
            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(<span>mut</span> w) = prev {
                <span>let</span> result = w.write_fmt(args);
                *s.borrow_mut() = <span>Some</span>(w);
                <span>return</span> result;
            }
            global_s().write_fmt(args)
        })
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| global_s().write_fmt(args));

    <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Err</span>(e) = result {
        <span>panic!</span>(<span>"failed printing to {}: {}"</span>, label, e);
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Which is, uh, well let's just say it's not exactly <em>simple</em> looking now? There
is a lot going on here!</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not faulting Rust here at all, my point is exactly the
opposite actually, in that there is <em>always</em> necessarily more going on in a
"Hello world!" than <code>puts "la de da"</code> or similar would have you believe on its
face. Speaking of Ruby's <code>puts</code>, what <em>is</em> the code that runs <code>puts</code> in the
Ruby interpreter itself, which is written in C?</p>
<p>Well it looks like <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7c2bbd1c7d40a30583844d649045824161772e36/io.c#L7727-L7758">this</a></p>
<pre><code><span>VALUE
<span>rb_io_puts</span><span>(<span>int</span> argc, <span>const</span> VALUE *argv, VALUE out)</span>
</span>{
    <span>int</span> i, n;
    VALUE <span>line</span>, args[<span>2</span>];

    
    <span>if</span> (argc == <span>0</span>) {

        <span>return</span> Qnil;
    }
    <span>for</span> (i=<span>0</span>; i&lt;argc; i++) {
        <span>if</span> (RB_TYPE_P(argv[i], T_STRING)) {
            <span>line</span> = argv[i];
            <span>goto</span> <span>string</span>;
        }
        <span>if</span> (rb_exec_recursive(io_puts_ary, argv[i], out)) {
            <span>continue</span>;
        }
        <span>line</span> = rb_obj_as_string(argv[i]);
      <span>string</span>:
        n = <span>0</span>;
        args[n++] = <span>line</span>;

            args[n++] = rb_default_rs;
        }
        rb_io_writev(out, n, args);
    }

    <span>return</span> Qnil;

<p>Hello world!</p>
<p>We all know that a languages like Ruby or Python are designed explicitly to
hide this sort of complexity from us and let us get on with the dirty business
of munging data blobs or serving web requests or solving sudokus or whatever,
and thank goodness for that, but wow that is <em>quite</em> a lot, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>When people come from languages that were designed to be ergonomic to more
systems oriented languages, they're often jarred by what they perceive to be
code thatis inelegant, ugly, and verbose. To be sure, it sometimes <em>is</em> exactly
that... (although anyone who has worked with a "pretty" language in a production
codebase knows that those are not immune to these descriptors either).</p>
<p>Usually, the tradeoff is explicit: elegance and simplicity for
<em>control</em>...  specific and granular <em>control</em>, over the program that will
eventually be run.  It isn't always necessary, in fact it is almost always _un_necessary,
to have <em>that</em> much control over your program. Obviously, productivity matters,
and if your business is <em><em>insert viable business</em></em>, well it's likely that your
goals are not going to be optimally met by futzing with manual memory
management all day (<a href="https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/">at least from the macro level, in the general
sense</a>).</p>
<p>But what if you <em>do</em> need that control? Well then, <em>you need it</em>. When every
ounce of performance actually is necessary, or on embedded systems with hard
memory constraints, or when writing code for some bespoke or otherwise uncommon
processor.</p>
<p>I'm going to choose one language, Zig, and dive deep into its hello world, but
it is important to note here that my point is not primarily about Zig, it's
about how <em>all</em> languages have to contend with an enormous amount of complexity
in order to do <em>anything</em>, even the simplest of tasks like a hello world
program. Complexity that is, for the most part, hidden from us in our day to
day. So what in the hello world is <em>actually</em> going on then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll be using the most current minor release version of Zig: 0.6.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Let's take a walk</h2>
<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>'s hello world looks like this, from the docs.:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
    <span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
    <span>try</span> stdout.print(<span>"Hello, {}!\n"</span>, .{<span>"world"</span>});
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are new to zig, a quick word on this syntax before I get into the gritty
details.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>@import</code> is a <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Builtin-Functions"><em>compiler
builtin</em></a> function
that assigns the namespace of the file it is referencing to the <code>const</code>
variable on the left hand side.</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span></span>() !<span>void</span> {
  
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like in C, <code>main</code> is a special function that marks the entry point to a
program after it has been compiled as an executable. Unlike in C, it accepts no
arguments (C's main function has a variety of vagaries that make it a bit
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4207223">unique</a>) and command line input is
available through utility functions to allow easier cross platform use.</p>
<p>It is marked <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Keyword-pub"><code>pub</code></a> so
that it is accessible from outside of the immediate module ('module' here
referring to nothing more than the top level scope of the current namespace...
i.e., the file), this is a necessary step since, as the program's entry point,
<code>main</code> would <em>have</em> to be accessible from outside the immediate scope.</p>
<p><code>fn</code> is the function keyword.</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is the name of the function (and where the argument list <em>would</em> be)
and <code>!void</code> is the return type. Looking a little closer at that return type:</p>
<p>In C, the return type of a function is declared <em>before</em> anything else. This
makes a certain amount of sense: it's congruent with how variables are
declared, after all, and scanning the file you can see clearly "calling this
will get you that."</p>
<p>In Zig, the return type comes after the function declaration but before the
function body. This also makes sense! It's the same in Rust and Go, and seems
to be generally a more modern approach. The reason is actually pretty simple:
doing it this way makes it possible to have a context-free grammar! C and C++
put the parser in a position where it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive">has to understand semantics to even just
<em>parse</em> the source
code.</a></p>
<p>In Zig, <code>main</code> returns <code>void</code> (well, actually, it can return a variety of
things, and if it returns void (which is just a way of saying it doesn't return
anything at all)), it's actually returning
<a href="https://github.com/jfo/zig/blob/7381aaf70e0cad92fc52b79f3aa2a0abb7c3ee04/lib/std/start.zig#L241-L244"><code>0</code></a>
as a success code, but) there is a wrinkle!  <code>void</code> is preceded by an
exclamation mark. This means: "This function is supposed to return <code>void</code>, but
it <em>could</em> fail and return an error." This is an <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.6.0/#Inferred-Error-Sets">inferred error
set</a>, and
whenever a function that <em>could</em> fail is called, the compiler will enforce that
you handle that error at the call site. More on Zig's error handling some other
time, for now it is enough to understand what the <code>!</code> in front of the return
type declaration means. I want to move on to the body of the function, let's go
line by line.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> stdout = std.io.getStdOut().outStream();
</code></pre>
<p>So, we can see that this is a call into a standard library function (<code>std</code>)
that returns something that we assign to <code>const stdout</code>. Standard out (stdout) and
standard error (stderr) may be familiar concepts from the shell, but what does it
mean to be referring to <code>stdout</code> here in this program? What exactly <em>is</em>
<code>stdout</code>? Whatever it is, it's being returned by the call to <code>outStream()</code>,
which is a method called on the return value of <code>std.io.getStdOut()</code>, so we
first need to know what <em>that</em> is.</p>
<p>To the source! In the Zig source tree, <code>std</code> lives in <code>lib/std/std.zig</code>, which
is a file that makes a wide variety of functionality available. It includes the line:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> io = <span>@import</span>(<span>"io.zig"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Which is referred to on the <code>std</code> variable as <code>std.io</code> (again, notice the <code>pub</code>
keyword, without which this declared constant would be inaccesible outside of
this immediate scope). Going deeper, into <code>lib/std/io.zig</code>...</p>
<pre><code><span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>getStdOut</span></span>() File {
    <span>return</span> File{
        .handle = getStdOutHandle(),
        .capable_io_mode = .blocking,
        .intended_io_mode = default_mode,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>stdout</code> is a <em>File</em> struct. Let's look at that. It is imported at the top
of <code>io.zig</code> as</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> File = std.fs.File;
</code></pre>
<p>and lives in the source, perhaps unsurprisingly, at <code>lib/std/fs/File.zig</code>. This
struct definition is quite long, so I'll focus on what we want to look at, the
<code>outStream()</code> method.</p>
<h2>An aside: methods vs functions</h2>
<p>Zig doesn't <em>really</em> have methods, but it's useful to talk about a special
class of functions <em>as</em> methods, since the calling convention supports implicit
passing of <code>self</code> when called on a struct "instance" using dot syntax. Let me
show you what I mean.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> std = <span>@import</span>(<span>"std"</span>);

<span>con…</span></code></pre></div></div>

          <small>8 August 2020</small>


<p>by Greg Vaughn</p>

<p>I’ve noticed changes in how I prefer to develop software since I’ve been
focusing my career on Elixir. It allows me to think bigger thoughts and to
develop with lower friction and less fear. I don’t want to go back.</p>

<h2 id="it-began-with-fault-tolerance">It Began with Fault Tolerance</h2>

<p>Many people are introduced to Elixir because of its focus on concurrency.  Joe
Armstrong even called Erlang a “concurrency oriented” language. (Note: most of
my points are generic to any BEAM language, but my experience comes from an
Elixir perspective, so please excuse bias in my terminology). I find it helpful
to consider concurrency a logical consequence of a more primeval concern: fault
tolerance. Achieving BEAM-style fault tolerance comes from isolated processes
which do not affect any other if they crash, plus a supervisory process being
informed when another process dies.</p>

<p>The core point of processes is to contain the “blast radius” of damage caused
by an error. It just so happens that the isolation qualities that enable that
also make them great candidates for concurrency.</p>

<h2 id="let-it-crash">“Let It Crash”</h2>

<p>When I first heard the “Let It Crash” mantra of the Erlang community, it
sounded crazy based on my prior development exerience. It’s important to
understand that it is not a license for irresponsibility, or that we should not
care about the system crashing. What it is, at the core, is a recognition that
our systems will have errors (even <em>if</em> we write bug-free code, hardware will
bug us eventually) and that with an architecture of managing the “blast radius”
of damage, then little parts of the system crashing are no longer a scary
thing.</p>

<p>Less fear – yes, please! I’ve learned to write my Elixir code with a focus
on “blast radius” as a driver for when to reach for processes. Even in cases where I
don’t need concurrency, I’ll use a process to enclose the damage an error might
cause. I use supervision trees and durable work queues to recover from those
minor crashes of processes.  I’ve learned to prefer upserts over inserts to
allow my logic to be retried safely for greater idempotency. These two ideas
of processes to enclose possible errors plus idempotency have become second
nature to me in any Elixir code I write.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>

<p>This automatic ability to recover from errors changes the complexion of topics
like test coverage enforcement, static types, extensive code reviews, etc. All
those, at heart, are about preventing errors from being introduced in the first
place (yes, I recognize their secondary benefits too). Those are still good
things (I am not advocating irresponsibility), but with the solid safety net of
fault tolerance from BEAM, we are able to look at them from a different
perspective and see that they do add some friction and inertia to delivering
software.  Perhaps we can temper our reliance upon them in favor of greater
delivery speed in some circumstances. Less fear means more freedom to choose.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-thoughts">Bigger Thoughts</h2>

<p>Elixir re-ignited my intellectual interest in software development. I found,
via Erlang and BEAM history in general, a huge body of wisdom in distributed
systems that I can learn from, and new tools in my toolbox of how to think
about software. With processes so lightweight, pervasive, and offering freedom
from fear of crashing, my perspective shifted in exciting ways. If I think I’m
writing a “web application” then my thoughts are immediately limited. I now
think of building systems. I can think bigger thoughts because I have better
abstractions to build them upon.</p>

<p>Some teams are happy to use Elixir to write web applications, to fit it into
their pre-existing microservice deployment model. I urge developers to reach
for those bigger thoughts that fault tolerant lighweight processes enable. You
can consider each process a logical microservice, but you don’t need the
friction of deploying it separately, and serializing to/from json, and
containers, and orchestration, and distributed logging, et.al.  You can deploy an
entire system of millions of interacting logical microservices in a single BEAM
release.</p>

<h2 id="game-changer">Game Changer</h2>

<p>Elixir and BEAM certainly have been a game changer for me. I’m more fearless when I
build systems, and I hope I can share that freedom with others. The BEAM has spoiled
me, but in a good way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Youâ€™ve had a long week but fortunately itâ€™s Friday and things are looking up. After grinding through the day, you stop on the way home to buy groceries for dinner. After getting the necessities, you decide on impulse to buy a dozen cookies. Youâ€™re on a diet, but you reassure yourself that youâ€™ll eat only one, two at most, to celebrate the arrival of the weekend. Once home, you enjoy your celebratory cookies as planned. Two are enough, but despite your best efforts you continue eyeballing those remaining cookies. Wouldnâ€™t they go great with milk? Maybe just one more with a glass? Before you know it, youâ€™ve polished off a dozen cookies and several glasses of milk, and youâ€™re cursing your poor self-control.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, at least it was fat-free milk. Also, youâ€™re not alone. Research that prompted people to record whatâ€™s happening multiple times a day <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">found</a> that self-control failures are a frequent and common occurrence of everyday life. Whether itâ€™s pizza, beer or doing anything but exercising, we all have our vices, and many of us would like to have better self-control. But what is self-control exactly? A working definition is that itâ€™s the ability to do whatâ€™s in your best interests in the long run â€“ such as managing your weight â€“ over whatâ€™s enjoyable right now â€“ such as gorging on cookies.</p>
<p>In 2007, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister put forward what has become the most influential psychological model of self-control. His <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00534.x">strength model</a> likens willpower to a muscle. If you start doing pushups, youâ€™ll feel only a minor burn. But keep it up, and that minor burn will grow into a full-blown conflagration, at which point you wonâ€™t be able to keep going. Baumeister suggested that the same thing happens when you use self-control. If you overwork your self-control muscle, youâ€™ll eventually run out of willpower, and lose the ability to exert self-control.</p>
<p>The success of Baumeisterâ€™s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307740/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney/">book</a> <em>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength</em> (2012), co-authored with John Tierney, suggests that the strength model resonates with many people. As a doctoral student studying self-control, I can understand why. The model eloquently explains many of our most vexing self-control failures. In the cookie example, the tumultuous week, capped off by an agonising day, sapped your willpower, leaving you unable to resist those cookies. Additionally, it conforms to our commonsense beliefs about self-control. After all, everyone knows that self-control is hard and, more often than not, we need herculean willpower to overcome temptation.</p>
<p>If the strength model is correct, what does this mean for improving your self-control? Applying the muscle analogy, one possibility might be to strengthen your â€˜self-control muscleâ€™. Researchers have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">tested</a> this by asking people to do things such as brush their teeth with their nondominant hand for two weeks. Such exercises are quite challenging because they force you to curtail deeply ingrained habits using â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™. But does self-control training actually work? According to a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691617697076">meta-analysis</a> of many relevant studies, self-control training seems to be effective at improving â€˜self-control staminaâ€™ â€“ the ability to exert inhibitory self-control for longer periods.</p>
<p>So, is that the solution to greater self-discipline? Exercise your self-control muscle and get better at inhibitory self-control?</p>
<p>Your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules</p>
<p>Unfortunately, itâ€™s not so simple. You might have noticed how I switched back and forth between â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™ and the broader concept of â€˜self-controlâ€™, but the two are not synonymous. Though boosting your inhibitory self-control or â€˜willpowerâ€™ might sound appealing â€“ perhaps you imagined yourself using inhibitory self-control to force yourself not to eat the cookies, just like you would if you forced yourself to brush with the opposite hand â€“ itâ€™s not clear that inhibitory self-control actually works this way in everyday life.</p>
<p>Take the findings from a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550616679237">study</a> that involved volunteers recording their daily experiences of temptation for a week. The individuals who experienced more temptation were less likely to achieve their long-term goals, even if they also reported using more inhibitory self-control. This suggests that using inhibitory self-control to resist those cookies might help you in the moment, but not in the long run. So even if you use inhibitory training (eg, the teeth-brushing challenge) to build a brawny self-control muscle, your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules.</p>
<p>Research in my own lab and others suggests that, if you want to improve your self-control, what you should do instead is focus on proactively reducing, rather than reactively overpowering temptation. Fortunately, there are several ways and opportunities to do this.</p>
<p>Before getting to the specifics, it helps to think in terms of a model that the American psychologist Angela Duckworth and her colleagues <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691615623247">proposed</a> â€“ â€˜the process model of self-controlâ€™. It organises self-control strategies according to when theyâ€™re initiated in the â€˜temptation generation cycleâ€™. This cycle describes the stages we must go through before we get to the point where we actually act upon a temptation â€“ see the figure below.</p>
<p>For example, to gorge on those cookies at the end of your working week, you first had to go through a <em>situational stage</em>, where you put yourself in a compromising situation with tempting cookies. From there, you transitioned to an <em>attentional stage</em>, where you directed your attention back towards those cookies. After that, you went through an <em>appraisal stage</em>, where you thought about how good those cookies would taste (especially with a glass of milk). All this led to a <em>response stage</em>, where you broke down and eventually ate all the cookies. To put it bluntly, a lot of things had to go wrong for you to end up giving in to temptation. The good news is that this means you could have applied self-control at several instances prior to when you tried and failed to exert <em>inhibitory</em> self-control (or â€˜willpowerâ€™ in everyday talk).</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1214/Williamson-self-control-Figure.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><em>Figure supplied by the author</em></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>Letâ€™s start with the situational stage. You donâ€™t need to be well-versed in social psychology to recognise the power of the situation. Most teachers will tell you itâ€™s easier for students to focus when they sit in the front of the classroom. With this in mind, you could have employed what Duckworthâ€™s team call â€˜situational self-control strategiesâ€™. For instance, instead of sitting in front of a box of cookies and forcing yourself not to eat them, you could have either not bought them in the first place â€“ known as â€˜situation selectionâ€™ â€“ or simply removed them from sight by placing them in a cabinet (or thrown them out) â€“ â€˜situation modificationâ€™.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that these situational strategies are quite effective. For example, one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158155">study</a> that instructed high-school students to use situational strategies (such as removing buzzing cellphones and other temptations from sight) found that they made more progress towards their academic goals, compared with others who were simply instructed to use inhibitory self-control. Similarly, dieting <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666318305889?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint">research</a> suggests that a simple yet overlooked way to lose weight is to avoid situations where tempting, high-calorie foods are readily available. For example, when you go grocery shopping, plan to avoid walking through the bakery. That way, you are less likely to encounter cues (pleasant smells and sights) that strengthen temptation. Think â€˜out of sight, out of mindâ€™.</p>
<p>But what if you canâ€™t use situational strategies? After all, you might have no choice but to walk through the bakery, or perhaps youâ€™ll upset your kids if you throw away the cookies. Thankfully, there are other â€˜psychological strategiesâ€™, initiated during the attentional and appraisal stages, that can be useful when the situation is uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Some clues come from Walter Mischelâ€™s classic â€˜marshmallow testâ€™ that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/152988602317319285">involved</a> children attempting to resist a single beckoning marshmallow for 15 minutes, for the reward of two if they were successful. Among other crucial variables, Mischel and his collaborators, including the American psychologist Ozlem Ayduk, suggested that one reason some kids were so good at resisting temptation was their ability to use â€˜cooling strategiesâ€™. For instance, research in Mischelâ€™s lab found that children would wait longer if they distracted themselves by simply turning away from the marshmallow. He also found that they could wait longer if he taught them to â€˜reappraiseâ€™ the temptation by thinking of the marshmallows as â€˜puffy round cloudsâ€™.</p>
<p>Importantly, these strategies work for adults too. In a series of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219883606">studies</a> I conducted with Ben Wilkowski at the University of Wyoming, we found that the use of distraction (for instance, directing attention away from the temptation to go out by focusing on work thatâ€™s particularly interesting) and reappraisal (reminding oneself there will be many opportunities to go out, but only one opportunity to take the upcoming exam), along with the situational strategies discussed earlier, consistently helped college students make progress towards their long-term goals. So, it might be useful to direct your attention away from the cookies by simply picking up a book or reframing the cookies in a way that makes them seem less desirable. You know, from where Iâ€™m sitting, the cookies look kind of old.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the message from the latest research on willpower is that itâ€™s time to stop lamenting your poor self-control and accept that you have a weak self-control muscle. It might be fun to change things up while you brush your teeth but, remember, building your self-control muscle probably wonâ€™t help you …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in the Fall 1 2020 batch of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, I only attended for one day. Still, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">keeping</a> <a href="https://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2015/07/20/retrospective/">with</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@byshiny/my-recurse-center-batch-winter-2-2019-is-the-best-5e9593386ab">the</a> <a href="http://dev.jdherg.com/posts/2015/07/20/the-recurse-center-a-qa-for-past-me/">spirit</a> <a href="https://ljungblad.nu/post/63534520693/new-york-and-recurse-center-prev-hacker-school">of</a> <a href="https://johnloeber.com/w/hackerschool.html">the</a> <a href="https://blog.jabid.in/2017/08/10/rc.html">times</a>, I thought I would write a retrospective. Time to look back on my RC journey!</p>

<p>I had heard of the Recurse Center some years ago, through (I believe) <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>. The basic idea is that RC is a “self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City”. My mental model for what this looked like is something like this: people from various walks of life come together in a common space to do cool/fun software stuff. Longer term or overarching goals vary somewhat from person to person (e.g. some may want a career change, some want to goof off, some want to learn something very specific), but broadly speaking the participants are there to learn, play, and improve as programmers. As a business, RC operates via supplying recruiters with a pool of talented and motivated job candidates. But for the participants itself it is free, and there is no particular pressure to take a job. Sounds pretty awesome!</p>
<p>Looking back at what I was hoping to get out of RC, the main things were</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to get better at software development, and in my experience one of the best ways to do this is through collaboration with others.</li>
<li>I get excited about sharing things I have learned with. I’m rather introverted, but when it comes to topics I am interested in (e.g. math, programming) there is a lot of joy in communication.</li>
<li>I was interested in learning more about alternative institutions for “adult education”. In today’s age, most people have to navigate an uncertain career path, which involves learning new skills, thinking about how to “rebrand” themselves, and so on. I spent some years in academia (including 5 years teaching), so I am fully aware of how that system works and the baggage it carries with it (<strong>cough</strong> lots of time and debt <strong>cough</strong>). Likewise, now that I’ve been in industry for a few years, I have also come to recognize how unseriously “career development” is taken by many employers (though good managers take it upon themselves to look out for their employees in this regard). For these reasons and more, I have felt institutions like the Recurse Center can play an increasingly important role in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I thought the Recurse Center had a lot to offer above and beyond an independent sabbatical. But it’s not easy to make it out there to NYC.</p>

<p>I had flirted with the idea of applying to RC for some time, but personal circumstances made committment to it difficult. The first time I considered attending was in 2016, after finishing a math phd. At the time, I did not have the money to support myself living in NYC without a job for 3 months, and so let go of the idea. The second time I considered attending was last year. I was working in the Bay Area as a software engineer and had enough money to pay the bills, but I was also engaged in a long-distance relationship at that time, and was hesitant to uproot myself in a way that would put more physical and emotional distance between myself and my partner (the good news is we’re married and living together now!).</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Recurse Center has shifted to an online-only format, and suddenly my excuses for not attending had evaporated. I applied for a batch and went through the standard interview process: first a quick Zoom call to talk about big picture stuff (personal motivation and so on), followed by a pair programming session (I worked on a toy computer algebra system in Python). And like that, I had been accepted!</p>
<p>I was quite excited to attend. But the last step was also the scariest: I had to quit my job. There’s a nerve wracking element to quitting a job during a pandemic, but I felt that in my current role I had stopped growing in a positive direction and imagined that attending RC would give me some time and space to move things forward. So I did it – I put in my notice at work, and spend the last two weeks trying my best to leave my (former) teammates in a position for success with me gone.</p>

<p>The RC interview process was relatively simple: there had been two Zoom calls scheduled, and the information about these was displayed on the Recurse website immediately upon login. Once I had been accepted, though, things got a bit messier.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that running an online educational retreat differs substantially from an in-person one. In the week leading up to the first day of my batch I received a dozen or so emails covering various operational details, invitations to join Zulip (the chat / discussion software used), to join the GitHub organization, requests to fill out my Recurse profile, links to documents with titles like “Remote RC Orientation Guide”, and so on. It was a lot to take in, and I was wrapping up my last week at work, but I figured that I would get the hang of things once the batch officially started.</p>
<p>I also was assigned an onboarding buddy, who I chatted with the Saturday before my first day. This was quite fun, as we happened to have a number of overlapping interests, so the conversation naturally took care of itself. This experience reinforced in my mind that I had made the right decision to attend: spending a few weeks / months hacking around on software stuff with people like this seemed like a real treat.</p>
<p>The last thing I remember from onboarding was a link to a shared calendar, to which anyone could create a new event. There were already quite a few on there, such as a weely meeting for people trying to learn more mathematics, another weekly meeting for a ML reading group, a daily leetcode practice time, “office hours” held by various RC staffers, some fun stuff, like a streamed cello practice on saturdays, music / book clubs, and many more.</p>
<p>One of my concerns about attending remotely is the time difference between participants. I’m on Pacific time, the Recurse Center itself is on Eastern time, and many of the participants for the remote batches are even further away: some in South America, some in Europe, and so on. But most seemed to be based out of North America, and it was a relief to see the calendar events: although some were at times which I likely wouldn’t attend (e.g. there was an Elm hacking session at 3am my time), most were mid-morning to early afternoon PST.</p>
<p>Pretty cool! I went to bed Sunday night, looking forward to my first day at RC.</p>

<p>My first day started like many of my recent days: I woke up, fed the cat, made some coffee, and then sat down at my computer. There were a few convesations on Zulip. I RSVP’ed for the ML reading group and mentioned I’d be happy to join them at whatever point they were at (this group had started a few weeks earlier, so they had already read 6 chapters of a book). I chatted with someone re: asyncio in Python. We talked about how you can view `async def` as syntactic sugar over ordinary python coroutine stuff, what the event loop is doing, and so on.</p>
<p>I observed, but did not participate in some slightly touchier conversations. One discussion was about a blog post re: Google, “don’t be evil”, and the actual nature of incentives. As you would expect, people feel rather strongly about this, and two camps emerged (one roughly “capitalism bad; eat the rich”, the other “welcome to realpolitik; smash your illusions”) before it was shut down by RC staff. I confess much of my interest in this particular conversation was just in getting a feel for the norms around such a discussion (i.e. to understand expectations around how I conduct myself or discuss controversial topics, and so on – basically, I just want to talk code and math and otherwise don’t want to piss anyone off). The Recurse Center has a formal code of conduct and set of community guidelines, but at any organization there are also many the unwritten rules. In this case, for example, I am not sure whether the discussion actually violated any explicit guideline, but once a RC staffer asked them to stop it, the participants did so.</p>
<p>And so it goes. Anyways, after this, I started scoping out the first project to work on: I wanted to write a toy version of the <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/">mill</a> build tool in python to use for another project I had been involved with (basically a big hairy pipeline for astronomical data reduction). I thought through this some, drafted some notes on its design, and ate a late lunch.</p>

<p>There is a common dream which many people experience at some point in their life: they show up to school for the first day of classes, only to realize that they have forgotten to get dressed. I’d never thought about what form this would take for online school. With Zoom, anybody can show up in their underwear, thinking perhaps that the camera is off. But I was dressed!</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, RC used six distinct channels for communicating information to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>direct email, which was the main channel used before I was accepted to the batch</li>
<li>threads on the “Recurse Community” site, which supports something like a message board (but which will also send you emails)</li>
<li>discussions in Zulip (which seemed to be the most active – many conversations every day)</li>
<li>the 1-1 I had with my “onboarding buddy”</li>
<li>the wiki pages, mentioned above</li>
<li>the calendar itself, which is the main way in which events are communicated and coordinated. It’s how I found friends to talk about ML with, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a “Virtual RC” space, which is something like a 2D HTML5 canvas MMO where you can move your avatar to various “rooms”. It’s kind of cute; someone was camped outside by a tree.</p>
<p>Bombarded by all of this information, much of which came last week when I was trying to wrap things up at my job, I basically a) added a tag in gmail to at least get all the RC related notifications under one heading, b) made sure to read the “Remote RC Orientation …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Try it <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html">here</a>! The online version is mainly good for small programs currently; see <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/running.html">running.md</a> for more options.</em></p>
<p><strong>BQN</strong> is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays. However, because of its focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations, BQN should also be a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.</p>
<p>BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human-friendly <strong>infix notation</strong> with no precedence rules to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in array operations</strong> handle any number of dimensions easily.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/leading.html"><strong>leading axis model</strong></a>, which allows for simpler built-in functions.</li>
<li>Trains and combinators for <strong>tacit programming</strong>.</li>
<li>Lightweight <strong>anonymous functions</strong> (like <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn">dfns</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>based array model</strong> makes non-arrays a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New <strong>array notation</strong> eliminates the gotchas of <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation">stranding</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html"><strong>context-free grammar</strong></a> where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.</li>
<li>Oh, and it naturally leads to <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/functional.html"><strong>first-class functions</strong></a>, a feature often missed in APL.</li>
<li>The <strong>new symbols</strong> for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-name-is-bqn">What kind of name is "BQN"?</h2>
<p>It's three letters, that happen to match the capitals in "Big Questions Notation". You can pronounce it "bacon", but are advised to avoid this unless there's puns.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-bqn-look-like">What does BQN look like?</h2>
<p>Rather strange, most likely:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŠ‘+</span><span>`</span><span>âˆ˜</span><span>âŒ½</span><span>â�Ÿ</span><span>12</span><span>â†•</span><span>2</span>  144
</pre>
<p>For longer samples, you can <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/c.bqn">gaze into the abyss</a> that is the self-hosted compiler, or the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/r.bqn">shallower but wider abyss</a> of the runtime, or take a look at the friendlier <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/md.bqn">markdown processor</a> used to format and highlight documentation files. There are also <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/examples/fifty.bqn">some translations</a> from <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/">"A History of APL in 50 Functions"</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="array-model">Array model</h2>
<p>Most of BQN's functionality deals with the manipulation of multidimensional arrays. However, it discards many of the complications of traditional APL <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Array_model">array models</a>. Unlike in APL, non-array data is possible, and common: numbers, characters, and functions are not arrays (see the full list of <a href="#types">types</a> below). This avoids some difficulties that show up when trying to treat scalar arrays as the fundamental unit; in particular, there is no "floating" so a value is always different from a scalar array that contains it. This system has been <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/586656.586663">proposed</a> in APL's past under the name <strong>based array theory</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, the intention is that arrays will not have prototypes, so that all empty arrays of the same shape behave identically. Different elements of an array should not influence each other. While some APLs force numbers placed in the same array to a common representation, which may have different precision properties, BQN will enforce 64-bit floating-point precision, and only use representations or methods compatible with it (for example, integers up to 32 bits).</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>BQN syntax consists of expressions where computation is done with a little organizing structure around them like assignment, functions, and list notation. Expressions are where the programmer is in control so the design tries to do as much as possible with them before introducing special syntax.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Like APL, BQN uses four <em>syntactic roles</em> for values in expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>, like APL arrays or J nouns</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>, or verbs in J</li>
<li><strong>1-Modifiers</strong>, like APL monadic operators or J adverbs</li>
<li><strong>2-Modifiers</strong>, like APL dyadic operators or J conjunctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These roles work exactly like they do in APL, with functions applying to one or two subject arguments, 1-modifiers taking a single function or subject on the left, and 2-modifiers taking a function or subject on each side.</p>
<p>Unlike APL, in BQN the syntactic role of a value is determined purely by the way it's spelled: a lowercase first letter (<code><span>name</span></code>) makes it a subject, an uppercase first letter (<code><span>Name</span></code>) makes it a function, and underscores are used for 1-modifiers (<code><span>_name</span></code>) and 2-modifiers (<code><span>_name_</span></code>). Below, the function <code><span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span></code> treats its left argument <code><span>ð�•Ž</span></code> as a function and its right argument <code><span>ð�•©</span></code> as a subject. With a list of functions, we can make a table of the square and square root of a few numbers:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŸ¨</span><span>Ã—</span><span>Ëœ</span><span>,</span><span>âˆš</span><span>âŸ©</span> <span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span><span>âŒœ</span> <span>1</span><span>â€¿</span><span>4</span><span>â€¿</span><span>9</span>
â”Œâ”€         
â•µ 1 16 81  
  1  2  3  
          â”˜
</pre>
<p>BQN's built-in operations also have patterns to indicate the syntactic role: 1-modifiers (<code><span>ËœÂ¨Ë˜â�¼âŒœÂ´`</span></code>) are all superscript characters, and 2-modifiers (<code><span>âˆ˜â—‹âŠ¸âŸœâŒ¾âŠ˜â—¶âš‡âŽ‰â�Ÿ</span></code>) all have an unbroken circle (two functions <code><span>âŒ½â�‰</span></code> have broken circles with lines through them). Every other built-in constant is a function, although the special symbols <code><span>Â¯</span></code>, <code><span>âˆž</span></code>, and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> are used as part of numeric literal notation.</p>

<h3 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h3>
<p><em>Combinators</em> only control the application of functions. Because a non-function operand applies as a constant function, some combinators have extra meanings when passed a constant. For example, <code><span>0</span><span>Ëœ</span></code> is the constant function that always returns 0 and <code><span>0</span><span>âŠ¸</span><span>&lt;</span></code> is the function that tests whether its right argument is greater than 0.</p>

<p>Choose isn't really a combinator since it calls the function <code><span>âŠ‘</span></code>, and Under is not a true combinator since it has an "undo" step at the end. This step might be implemented using the left operand's inverse (<em>computational</em> Under) or its structural properties (<em>structural</em> Under).</p>
<p>Other modifiers control array traversal and iteration. In three cases a simpler 1-modifier is paired with a generalized 2-modifier: in each case the 1-modifier happens to be the same as the 2-modifier with a right operand of <code><span>Â¯1</span></code>.</p>

<h2 id="literal-notation">Literal notation</h2>
<h3 id="constant-notation">Constant notation</h3>
<p>BQN has single-token notation for numbers, strings, and characters.</p>
<p>Numbers allow the typical decimal notation with <code><span>Â¯</span></code> for the negative sign (because <code><span>-</span></code> is a function) and <code><span>e</span></code> for scientific notation (or <code><span>E</span></code>, as numeric notation is case-insensitive). <code><span>âˆž</span></code> and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> may be used as special numeric values. Complex numbers are also allowed, with the components separated by <code><span>i</span></code>.</p>
<p>Strings are written with double quotes <code><span>""</span></code>, and characters with single quotes <code>''</code> with a single character in between. A double quote within a string can be escaped by writing it twice; if two string literals are next to each other, they must be separated by a space. In contrast, character literals do not use escapes, as the length is already known.</p>
<h3 id="separators">Separators</h3>
<p>The characters <code><span>â‹„</span></code> and <code><span>,</span></code> and newline are completely interchangeable and are used to separate expressions. An expression might be an element in a list or a line in a function. Empty sectionsâ€”those that consist only of whitespaceâ€”are ignored. This means that any number of separators can be used between expressions, and that leading and trailing separators are also allowed. The expressions are evaluated in text order: left to right and top to bottom.</p>
<h3 id="list-notation">List notation</h3>
<p>Lists (1-dimensional arrays) are enclosed in angle brackets <code><span>âŸ¨âŸ©</span></code>, with the results of the expressions in between being the list's elements. Lists of two elements or more can also be written with the ligature character <code><span>â€¿</span></code>. This character has higher binding strength than any part of an expression. If one of the elements is a compound expression, then it will need to be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>ZzFXM is a tiny JavaScript function that generates stereo music tracks from patterns of note and instrument data.
  Instrument samples are created using a modified<sup>[<a href="#note-code-1">1</a>]</sup> version of the super-tiny <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> sound generator by <a href="https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank Force</a>.
   </p><figure><pre><code>//! ZzFXM (v2.0.1) | (C) Keith Clark | MIT | https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM
zzfxM=(f,n,o,t=125)=&gt;{let z,e,l,r,g,h,x,a,u,c,d,i,m,p,G,M,R=[],b=[],j=[],k=0,q=1,s={},v=zzfxR/t*60&gt;&gt;2;for(;q;k++)R=[q=a=d=m=0],o.map((t,d)=&gt;{for(x=n[t][k]||[0,0,0],q|=!!n[t][k],G=m+(n[t][0].length-2-!a)*v,e=2,r=m;e&lt;x.length+(d==o.length-1);a=++e){for(g=x[e],u=c!=(x[0]||0)|g|0,l=0;l&lt;v&amp;&amp;a;l++&gt;v-99&amp;&amp;u?i+=(i&lt;1)/99:0)h=(1-i)*R[p++]/2||0,b[r]=(b[r]||0)+h*M-h,j[r]=(j[r++]||0)+h*M+h;g&amp;&amp;(i=g%1,M=x[1]||0,(g|=0)&amp;&amp;(R=s[[c=x[p=0]||0,g]]=s[[c,g]]||(z=[...f[c]],z[2]*=2**((g-12)/12),zzfxG(...z))))}m=G});return[b,j]}</code></pre><figcaption>The ZzFXM song generator function — 418 bytes (gzip)</figcaption></figure>   <p>ZzfxM was developed to create music for size-limited productions (i.e. js13k Games). The song format is loosely based on the tracker MOD format, using sequences of repeating patterns to create long songs from small chunks of music data.
  Songs are <em>highly</em> compressible. Once gzipped they're tiny — typically, a few hundred bytes.</p>


  <h2>Playing a song</h2>
  <p>Audio samples are compiled by passing instrument, pattern and sequence data to <code>zzfxM()</code>. The function returns a pair of arrays containing sample data for the left and right stereo channels.
  To play the rendered song, call <code>zzfxP()</code> using the generated sample data. The <code>zzfxM</code> function returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode">AudioBufferSourceNode</a>, which you can use to control the song (stop it, looping etc.).</p>

  <figure><pre><code>const songData = [
  [/* zzfx instruments */],
  [/* patterns */],
  [/* sequence */],
  /* speed (BPM) */
];

const buffer = zzfxM(...songData);    // Generate the sample data
const node = zzfxP(...buffer);        // Play the song
</code></pre><figcaption>Example code</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
    <li id="note-code-1">[1] The modifications allow ZzFX to create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.</li>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>

<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>

  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

up in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code>. And make sure that its in your path by checking

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/connected.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>
<p><em><code>top</code> output from one server</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>

<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>

</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum

    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};

	<p>Write code that’s compatible with how your brain works.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

The first 225 digits of <a href="https://dancohen.org/2010/03/08/the-last-digit-of-pi/">Pi</a>.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit
span</a> of 8.83 which
fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

fovea is, it's actually only about as big as quarter held at arm's length.

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>

A carefully tended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">Bonsai</a> tree.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>
