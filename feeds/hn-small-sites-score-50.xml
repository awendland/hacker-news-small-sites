<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Daniel J. Bernstein's IM2000 email proposal is not a good idea</h2>

	<p><small>September  6, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>A long time ago, Daniel J. Bernstein wrote a proposal for a new
generation of Internet email he called <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a>, although it never went anywhere.
Ever since then, a significant number of people have idealized it
as the great white 'if only' hope of email (especially as the
solution to spam), in much the same way that people idealized Sun's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> as the great 'if only'
alternative to X11. Unfortunately, IM2000 is not actually a good
idea.</p>

<p>The core of <a href="https://cr.yp.to/im2000.html">IM2000</a> is summarized by Bernstein as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>IM2000 is a project to design a new Internet mail infrastructure
around the following concept: Mail storage is the sender's
responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first problem with this is that it doesn't remove the fundamental
problem of email, which is (depending on how you phrase it) that
email is an <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols"><em>anonymous push</em> protocol</a>
or that it lacks <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SignedEmailWrongProblem"><em>revocable authorization</em> to send you things</a>. In IM2000, random strangers on the
Internet are still allowed to push to you, they just push less data
than they currently do with (E)SMTP mail.</p>

<p>The idea that IM2000 will deal with spam rests on the idea that
forcing senders to store mail is difficult for spammers. Even a
decade ago this was a questionable assumption, but today it is
clearly false. A great deal of serving capacity is yours for the
asking (and someone's credit card) in AWS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform">GCP</a>, Azure, OVH,
and any number of other VPS and serverless computing places.  In
addition many spammers will have a relatively easy time with
'storing' their email, because their spam is already generated from
templates and so in IM2000 could be generated on the fly whenever
you asked for it from them. We now have a great deal of experience
with web servers that generate dynamic content on demand and it's
clear that they can run very efficiently and scale very well,
provided that they're designed competently.</p>

<p>(I wrote about this a long time ago <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageHelpsSpammers">here</a>, and things have gotten much
easier for spammers since then.)</p>

<p>At the same time, IM2000 is catastrophic for your email privacy.
People complain vociferously about 'tracking pixels' in HTML email
that betray when you open and read the email from someone; well,
IM2000 is one giant tracking pixel that reliably reports when and
where you read that email message. IM2000 would also be a terrible
email reading experience, because it's like a version of IMAP where
message retrieval has random delays and sometimes fails entirely.</p>

<p>(As far as spam filtering your incoming IM2000 messages goes, IM2000
gives you far less up front information than you currently get with
SMTP email. I wrote up this and other issues a long time ago in an
entry about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/SenderStorageProblems">the technical problems of such schemes</a>. Some of those problems are no longer
really an issue more than a decade later, but some continue to be.)</p>

<p>At a broader 'technical choices have social impacts' level, IM2000
would create a very different experience than today's email systems
if implemented faithfully, one where 'your' email was actually not
yours but was mostly other people's because other people are storing
it. Those other people can mostly retract individual messages by
deleting them from their servers (you would still have the basic
headers that are pushed to you), and they can wipe out large sections
of your email by deleting entire accounts (and the sent messages
associated with them), or even by going out of business or having
a data loss incident. Imagine a world where an ISP getting out of
the mail business means that all email that its customers have sent
from their ISP email accounts over the years just goes away, from
everyone's mailbox.</p>

<p>(If 'ISP' sounds abstract here, substitute 'Yahoo'. Or 'GMail'.)</p>

<p>In addition, in some potential realizations of IM2000, email would
become mutable in practice (even if you weren't supposed to in
theory), because once again the sender is storing the message and
is in a position to alter that stored copy. Expect that capability
to be used sooner or later, just as people silently revise things
posted on the web (including official statements, perhaps especially
including them).</p>

<p>Some of these social effects can be partially avoided by storing
your own local copies of IM2000 messages when you read them, but
there are two issues. The first is pragmatic; the more you store
your own copies and the earlier you make them, the more IM2000 is
SMTP in a bad disguise. The second is social; in the IM2000 world
the server holds the authoritative copy of the message, not you,
so if you say the message says one thing (based on your local copy)
and the server operator says it says something else (or doesn't
exist), the server operator likely wins unless you have very strong
evidence.</p>

<p>In general, I think that IM2000 or anything like it would create
an 'email' experience that was far more like the web, complete with
the experience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a>
and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CoolUrlsChange">cool messages changing</a>, than today's
email (where for better or worse you keep your own full record of
what you received, read and reread it at your leisure, and know
that it's as immutable as you want it to be). And it would still
have the problem that people can push stuff in front of you, unlike
the web where you usually at least have to go looking for things.</p>

							<p>Fog clings to a never-ending row of low-rise buildings down the length of a dusty road, it’s early, around eight o’clock on a cool April morning. The fog clears and voices breakthrough and you see the first glimpses of the large bazaar, sounds of shutters slamming open, doors being unlocked and people greeting each other as their day starts. The occasional chatter of gunfire can be heard as firearms are test fired nearby.</p>
<p><em>Darra Adam Khel</em>. This bustling town is situated in modern-day <em>Pakistan</em>, a stone’s throw from the Pak-Afghan border. <em>What makes it so special?</em> You may ask and the answer lies within the myriad of myths and legends put out over the years.</p>

<p><span><iframe width="1160" height="653" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-f7j-RlN_Q?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As of this year, 2019, <em>Darra</em> is the last main tribal arms market and manufacturing town that remains in the Pak-Afghan FATA region (Federally-Administered Tribal Region – FATA pronounced Faa-Thaa locally), the last vestige of old-world freedom in the area. Over the last few years, the other manufacturing hubs and markets in towns like <em>Landi Kotal</em>, just a few minutes’ drive from <em>Torkham</em> border on the <em>Khyber Pass</em>, have finally died out leaving a handful of shops and a couple of gunsmiths who repair the large number of firearms still found across the region. <em>Peshawar’s</em> massive arms bazaars have also disappeared leaving a few licensed manufacturers in a small industrial estate on its outskirts and a few licensed dealers scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p><em>Darra</em> held out against the threat of the <em>Taliban</em> in the early 2010s, fighting them off on a number of occasions seeing as they had the arms, supplies and manpower to fend for themselves. They are no friend to these <em>Taliban</em> as you can see even though they have been linked by a few journalistic sources with selling them an enormous number of arms and ammunition. Contrary to popular belief that the market is now dead or not operating, the bazaar still thrives with many firearms bought and sold daily in its now-legendary bazaar. Yes, there were times were the shutters ere down but this was always just a façade, something that happened on the face and business continued in the back alleys and dusty basements.</p>
<p>However, the town of thousands of arms dealers and manufacturing workshops has been relegated to around a thousand of both due to the global war on terror and its impact on the global arms trade and international smuggling routes. They do not get as much as they used to though they still have a steady but small supply of items that get through to them even to this day. Due to this war on terror, the FATA area – which for many years managed to retain its autonomy, was regulated to prohibit the sale and ownership of explosive type ordnance and large-caliber arms such as HMG’s (e.g: DsHK / KPV) and up to the general population there. Fortunately, <em>Darra</em> still maintains its hold on the trade of tribal arms throughout the now regulated tribal areas and still holds a monopoly on arms manufactured there that are sold within <em>Pakistan</em> and <em>Afghanistan</em> too.</p>
<p>The war on terror has a lot of detriments with the main one being that it has increased the price of arms so much; that now an AK rifle which would have cost approximately Rs10,000 (~£55/~$67), around fifteen years ago, now costs a minimum of around ten times that. Yes, as with all markets, prices do fluctuate depending on many local and regional factors but prices still remain relatively high due to this. Genuine, original factory-made arms command a high premium on the market as a whole throughout the Pak-Afghan region and this has meant that locally made arms are sold more than originals due to the somewhat extortionate prices that can be seen. Due to soaring inflation and prices of raw material, locally made arms now cost the same as originals were only a decade or so ago.</p>

<p>Some older background information would be needed to understand why such a place even exists on such a scale as it is or even was. During the British Raj period of the 1800s where the British Empire ruled over these tribal areas, small workshops opened up in many areas across the region to produce exact copies of arms used by the British to fight back against them. Gunsmiths started with muskets and then progressed onto Lee-Enfield action rifles and that was their mainstay for a lengthy period continuing to upgrade and produce newer variations, turning those small shops into larger ones. That is how <em>Darra</em> and many other manufacturing towns and bazaars got their start and from then, the markets grew and grew becoming what they then were known as. <em>Darra’s</em> second major call to fame was that it supplied arms and ammunition to the <em>Mujahideen</em> in <em>Afghanistan</em> during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan War, some say it was even supported by the federal government too at this point. More recently, <em>Darra’s</em> notoriety came to surface as ill-informed people conducting poor journalism claimed it was a black market and that the gunsmiths manufactured guns in mud huts, with basic tools using their bare hands. Putting this to rest, let me start with calling it a black market; this is incorrect as the areas where these markets were/are based comes under its own tribal laws and governance much different to the rest of <em>Pakistan</em>, they are operating well within their own laws therefore it is not a black market in any sense within these borders. There is an element of truth to the thought of mud huts, bare hands and rudimentary methods but the times long past, when this was the norm, are not an indication of how things are in this day and age. Yes, some processes such as heat-treating and finishing are done in so-called mud huts and outdoors under makeshifts structures (this is much needed for ventilation) however the actual workshops are almost always in brick structures and the gunsmiths utilize milling machines, CNC machines and other tools to make their products. Yes, they do use basic tools but those are used to fit and finish the firearm and not to actually manufacture or produce it.</p>

<p>A negative misconception in regards to the firearms produced is the thought that they aren’t heat-treated or are of poor quality. This isn’t true for the most part as they do go through a heat-treating process, however the detractor is that the method of heat-treating leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the cheaper copies. Many users of lower quality copies complain of metal warping and deformation causing a firearm to become inoperable or dangerous to use, this is what leads to people surmising that all arms made in such areas are no good. This is an issue for lower quality copies, a lower quality firearm will have its flaws as it is not built using quality material and to the same tolerances as a firearm made to exact specs with all care taken in production. At the end of the day, you must repeat the same phrase to people who ask why a cheap item is no good; you get what you pay for – if you want a cheap item, you will get a cheap item that will end up having issues or breaking much like any cheap thing you buy.</p>
<p>Moving away from the negatives, let us talk about positives. Apart from the exquisite food that the food gurus cook up there, <em>Darra</em> is also famous for some of the firearms designs to come out of its shops – most notable is the infamous AKMSU which resides in the Royal Armouries, Leeds, UK. Even though that particular firearm could have been made elsewhere in FATA or <em>Afghanistan</em> by a number of other gunsmiths, it has been linked to <em>Darra</em> due to the town being the main source of arms for sale and the similar types of AK designed copies/modifications known to have come out of there. I could list an almost infinite number of firearms designs displaying their know-how such as the modified SKS made to resemble an AK, or the well-known 8mm bolt-action faux AK and even the more recent AK M4geries. Forget all of those firearms, the gunsmiths themselves are the ones to keep this market and tradition alive, it’s them you have to appreciate as without them there would be more-or-less nothing left of the industry. The ingenuity and skill they have has made <em>Darra</em> a household name throughout the region and extending to much of the world, even to those who are not versed on firearms.</p>

<p><em>Darra</em> has managed to stand against the tide of time and change in an increasingly connected world and holds its own against all odds but has still found a way to use newer technologies and retain its own methods &amp; procedures of manufacturing in its regular business. Even with all that, there is now news that changes things, FATA and Darra with it, will finally be incorporated into the neighboring <em>KPK</em> (<em>Khyber</em> <em>Pakhtunkhwa</em>) province of <em>Pakistan</em>. Regrettably, this means that their own tribal laws will now be abolished and government/regional laws and regulations will be implemented in its place there. The whole town’s industry will be made to register for licenses in either manufacturing or dealing sectors or be shut down. It is said that they will have easier access to raw materials and the costs of business will hopefully decrease, this is something that we can only hope does not destroy this historic industry. <em>Darra</em> will move into the new age with much newer equipment and tooling plus workshops and industrial estates that are planned to be built there and in other places with support of the current federal government of <em>Pakistan</em>. It is planned that arms manufactured there will be available to international markets via some …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div>

        <p>Design is a broad topic. This post won’t approach the adjective qualifying a style with simple forms and a pure appearance. No. Design is broader than a sleek car or an harmonious living room.</p>

<p>Design is a creative activity that aims to invent, improve and solve problems. Life is full of them, in various domains, which pushes people to eventually become a designer of something. Whether you’re conceiving a recipe, an apartment layout, a software or a rocket you are designing. By learning the fundamentals, you will arm yourself for various situations. Here is a list of the best pragmatic principles I’ve learned to better design. In spite of their obviousness and renown, my experience has shown me that some of these principles are often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: In english, <em>to design</em> means both <em>to draw</em> and <em>to conceive according to a plan</em>. Similarly in French, the word <em>dessin</em> (a drawing) derives its etymology from the word <em>dessein</em> (have the intention).</p>

<h2 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h2>

<p>Believing you can do it right the first time is naive at best, pretentious at worst. <strong>You will fail and have to accept it</strong>. Do not postpone but instead <strong>release fast</strong>, get feedback early and iterate to make it better. You will find many references, notably on Lean Startup, DevOps culture or Site Reliability Engineering, which encourage <strong>a quick redesign capability rather than a perfect design at the first place</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it. […]
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. Robert C. Martin — Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reuse-what-exists">Reuse what exists</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the problem you face is fundamentally new. Before making any effort, look for <strong>existing solutions</strong> or proven practices. <strong>Be humble</strong> and accept you can’t compete with years of expertise on a subject. If so, the motivation to develop the new model must come from reaching the limits of the previous one. In software engineering for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.</p>

<p>Don’t limit yourself to the area of the original problem, sometimes a similar problem has been found and solved long before in <strong>a different field</strong>. Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a> will help you to write an operating system scheduler as well as being frustrated in a supermarket queue. Solutions come from fields of experiences and theories that you would not necessarily expect.</p>

<h2 id="five-whys">Five whys</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Five whys technique</a>, originally developed by Toyota, has been mostly used for exploring the root cause of a defect in a system. It involves asking the relevant question starting with a why in order to find the source which cause the failure. Adapt this technique to find out what really matter in our design. For example, “<em>We need a program which exports our documentation to PDF</em>”:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why? - So the export can go on the website.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because our customers has to read it.</li>
  <li>Why? - Because they require it to maintain the software.</li>
  <li>Why (don’t they have access to the documentation like everyone else)? - Because they haven’t been integrated into our platform.</li>
  <li>Why? Because they have never been on-board on the platform.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Decision</strong>: instead of developing a complex program which exports PDF, write a simple on-boarding guide for the customers.</p>

<p>This situation often occurs when the given requirement includes the design. Before answering the question <em>“How do we do it?”</em> directly, the first and most important step is to remember “<em>Why do we do it?</em>”. Once you have understood the <strong>root reasons</strong> and constraints for the requirement, it clears the path on how to get there and can <strong>prevent</strong> you from taking <strong>very long detours</strong> in addition to <strong>simplifying</strong> the design.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">Keep it simple stupid</h2>

<p><strong>Resolve problems, don’t create them</strong>. You should be suspicious of providing a solution that makes the overall system more complicated than before. Remember: You’ll have to maintain everything you build, so you’d better build as little and simply as possible.</p>

<p>Simple designs are easy to <strong>learn</strong>, easy to <strong>teach</strong>, easy to <strong>use</strong> and therefore easily <strong>appeal</strong> to customers. It forces the design to be intuitive and obvious, reducing the learning curve and facilitates the adoption. Like Denis Diderot says in Pensées sur l’interprétation de la nature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These books [of Sthal and Newton] were just waiting to be heard, to be valued for what they were worth; and it would not have cost their authors more than a month to make them clear; that month would have spared three years of labor and exhaustion to a thousand good spirits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what is a simple design? In the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/simplicity/">Simplicity chapter of the Site Reliability Engineering</a> book of Google, they mention a great quote from the French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery about perfection which could fit very well with simplicity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away - A. de Saint Exupéry, Terre des Hommes</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good-enough">Perfect is the enemy of good enough</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.de/pin/397724210839705109/"><img src="https://reflexio.debec.eu/assets/moka-pot.svg" alt="moka"></a></p>

<p>The moka coffee maker may not produce perfect coffee, but it requires so little maintenance compared to a large coffee machine with radiators, pipes, grinder, etc. that it makes the compromise “complexity / coffee taste” great.</p>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>: in general <strong>80% of a things can be done in 20%</strong> of the total allocated time. Conversely, the hardest <strong>20% left takes 80%</strong> of the time. Perfection requires infinite time and energy. This is impossible and therefore should not be part of your design.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware of the perfection pitfall and design your architecture only as good as necessary and not as good as ultimate possible. - Ralf S. Engelschall</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="postpone-complexity">Postpone complexity</h2>

<p>Simplicity and incremental improvement principles give birth to a another principle: <strong>Postpone complexity</strong>. Complexity lies in early optimization, as Donald E. Knuth points out in his article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/361604.361612?download=true">Computer Programming as Art</a> with “<em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>”. Focus on designing something that works instead of something finely tune that does not.</p>

<p>Complexity lies also in early generalization. Focus on designing something that works in a single use case rather than something that will not work in many. When designing a coffee machine, first design something that makes a simple black coffee. If you plan ahead to include all extra options for latte, cappuccino or irish coffee you will end up not making a simple back coffee. As elegantly summarized by Ralf S. Engelschall: “<em>Use before reuse</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think there’s a principle missing? Send me your comments! This list will certainly be extended and refined, subscribe to the <a data-formkit-toggle="78a863d4eb" href="https://reflexio-debec.ck.page/78a863d4eb">newsletter</a> if you wish to be notified about it. In the meantime, how are you going to ensure that you do not forget to implement the principles you have just learned?</p>

    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/TI99-IMG_7143.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A"></p>
<p>When I was around 13-14 years old, home computers were just appearing
on the market.  The first machines that I remember to have been sold
in the large department stores in Berlin were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family">Atari 400 and
800</a> as well as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a>.
At the time, these machines were incredibly expensive, but me and my
friends often hung out in the stores to play around with these
machines and dream of owning them.</p>
<p>I found the TI-99/4A to be very good looking with its late 1970ies US
design and its nice keyboard.  In magazines I read that the machine
was slow and crippled, though, and the british home computers were
much cheaper, so I never became friends with the TI back then.</p>
<p>Recently, I found a machine cheaply on sale on an auction site and
bought it, despite the fact that neither the power supply nor the TV
modulator was included with the system.  The power brick was easy to
buy separately and I thought that I would not want the TV modulator
anyway.  I figured that the (european) TI outputs a component (YPbPr)
video signal and decided to try some conversion circuits that I found
on the Internet until I got something that one of my monitors could
display.</p>
<p>The first two attempts that I made failed, though.  One of the
schematics I had was a generic YPbPr conversion circuit based on a
bunch of opamps.  It did not produce a picture at all, but not knowing
enough about video signal encoding I did not manage to debug the
problem.  The same happened with another schematic that supposedly was
specifically designed for the TI-99/4A, but did not work for me
either.  Finally, I run across a new adapter circuit called
<a href="https://tms-rgb.com/">TMS-RGB</a> designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/npiegdon">Nicholas
Piegdon</a> just this year.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-pcb.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB PCB"></p>
<p>The TMS-RGB is a generic RGB converter for systems using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">TMS9929A</a>
chip, i.e. the TI-99/4A, some MSX systems and the ColecoVision.  It is
a tightly packed PCB with surface mounted components meant to be
soldered onto the solder side of the PCB of the machine to be
converted.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/tms-rgb-on-ti.jpg" alt="TMS-RGB mounted on TI-99/4A board"></p>
<p>To me, getting the PCB fabricated in China, sourcing the components
and soldering them onto the board with a microscope was part of the
fun.  It was not all that easy, though, and the TMS-RGB website has
some shops listed that sell the board ready for installation.
Installing it in the machine is very easy thanks to the excellent
videos published on the site.</p>
<p>The TMS-RGB converts the YPrPb signal to RGB + Sync, but it does not
change the overall timing.  This means that one either needs a monitor
that can deal with TV format RGB signals (i.e. one that has a RGB
SCART Input or a CBM 1084), or an upscaler that converts the signal to
match the expectations of a more modern computer monitor.  I bought a
cheap GBS-8200 upscaler board which produces a VGA output and it
worked fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://netzhansa.com/images/ti-and-upscaler.jpg" alt="TI-99/4A board and GNS-8200 upscaler"></p>
<p>In fact, the picture quality that I get with this on my TFT monitor is
just awesome.  The pixels are crisp and the is no blur, jail bars or
ghosting.  I can recommend the TMS-RGB board to anyone who wants to
equip their TMS9929A based hardware with a better video output.  The
overall cost for the PCB's, components and the upscaler board was
around 70 Euros.</p>

				<p>So the other day I both defined Tcl procedures all by myself and used them interactively, and I liked it, to the point where it felt like some kind of local optimum. This entry is an attempt to cope with the trauma of liking Tcl, by means of rationalizing it. I'll first tell the story of my fascinating adventures, and then I'll do the rationalizing (to skip the oh-so-personal first part, go straight for the bullet points).</p>
<p>Here's what I was doing. I have this board. The board has a chip on it. The chip has several processors in it. There's a processor in there that is a memory-mapped device, and I talk to it using CPU load/store commands. The CPU is itself a JTAG target, and I talk to it via a probe, issuing those load/store commands. To the probe I talk via USB using an ugly console that can't even handle the clipboard properly. The console speaks Tcl.</p>
<p>Net result: in order to talk to the memory-mapped processor, I have to speak Tcl. Or I can use a memory view window in a graphical debugger. Except some addresses will change the processor state when read (pop an item from a LIFO, that sort of thing). So no, memory view windows aren't a good idea – you have to aim for the specific address, not shoot at whole address ranges. Damn, just who thought of defining the hardware in such a stupid way? Why, it was me. Little did I know that I was thereby inflicting Tcl on myself.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's this bug I have to debug now, and as far as I know it could be in at least three different pieces of software or in two different pieces of hardware, and I don't like any of the 5 options very much, and I want to find out what it is already. So at the ugly probe console I type things like <code>word 0x1f8cc000</code> (reads the processor status), <code>word 0x1f8cc008 2</code> (halts the execution), <code>word 0x1f8cc020 0x875</code> (places a breakpoint). I get sick and tired of this in about 2 minutes, when the command history is large enough to make the probability of hitting Enter at the wrong auto-completed command annoying. It's annoying to run the wrong command because if I ruin the processor state, it will take me minutes to reproduce that state, because the program reads input via JTAG, which is as slow as it gets.</p>
<p>So I figure this isn't the last bug I'm gonna deal with this way, and it's therefore time for Extending my Environment, equipping myself with the Right Tools for the Job, Tailored to my needs, utilizing the Scripting capabilities of the system. I hate that, I really do. Is there something more distressing than the development of development tools for the mass market of a single developer? Can a programmer have a weakness more pathetic than the tendency to solve easy generic meta-problems when the real, specific problems are too hard? Is there software more disgusting in nature than plug-ins and extensions for a butt-ugly base system? But you know what, I really fail to remember 0x1f8cwhat the breakpoint address is. This story has one hexadecimal value too much for my brain. OK, then. Tcl.</p>
<p>I decided to have one entry point procedure, <code>pmem</code>, that would get a memory-mapped processor id, 'cause there are many of them, and then call one of several functions with the right base address, so that <code>pmem 0 pc</code> would do the same as <code>pmem_pc 0x1f8c0000</code>. Well, in Tcl that's as simple as it gets. Tcl likes to generate and evaluate command strings. More generally, Tcl likes strings. In fact, it likes them more than anything else. In normal programming languages, things are variables and expressions by default. In Tcl, they are strings. <code>abc</code> isn't a variable reference – it's a string. <code>$abc</code> is the variable reference. <code>a+b/c</code> isn't an expression – it's a string. <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code> is the expression. Could you believe that? <code>[expr $a+$b/$c]</code>. Isn't that ridiculous?</p>
<p>In fact, that was one of my main applications for Tcl: ridiculing it. I remember reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130385603">the huge Tcl/Tk book by Brent Welch</a> with my friend once. There was a power outage and it was past the time when the last UPS squeaked its last squeak. And the book was there 'cause the hardware guys use it for scripting their lovecraftian toolchain. We really did have fun. Tears went down my cheeks from laughter. Even people with the usual frightened/mean comments about those geeks who laugh their brains out over a Tcl book  didn't spoil it. So, ridiculing Tcl, my #1 use for it. The other use is the occasional scripting of the hardware hackers' lovecraftian toolchain. Overall, I don't use Tcl very much.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Tcl is that it's still a dynamic language, and reasonably laconic at that, modulo quoting and escaping. So I enter the usual addictive edit/test cycle using <code>tclsh &lt; script</code>. N minutes down the road (I really don't know what N was), I've finished my 2 screenfuls of Tcl and the fun starts. I actually start debugging the goddamn thing.<br>
<code><br>
$ pmem 0 stat<br>
IDLE<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 0 0xbff<br>
$ pmem 0 bkpt 1 0xa57<br>

$ pmem 0 pc<br>

</code></p>
<p><em>Weeee!</em> <em>HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!</em></p>
<p>You have no idea just how happy this made me. Yeah, I know, I'm overreacting. I'll tell you what: debug various kinds of hardware malfunction for several months, and you'll be able to identify with the warped notion of value one gains through such process. On second thought, I don't know if I'd really recommend it. Remember how I told <a href="http://www.yosefk.com/blog/low-level-is-easy.html">low-level programming was easy</a>? It is, fundamentally, but there's this other angle from which it's quite a filthy endeavor. I promise to blog about it. I owe it to the people who keep telling me "so low-level is easy?" each time they listen to me swear heartily at a degenerate hardware setup where nothing works no matter what you try. I owe it to myself – me wants to reach a closure here. Why should I tolerate being regularly misquoted at the moments of my deepest professional catharsis?</p>
<p>Aaaanyway, in just N minutes, I bootstrapped myself something not unlike a retarded version of gdb, the way it would work if the symbol table of my program was stripped. But no matter – I have <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/addr2line1.html">addr2line</a> for that. And the nice thing about my retarded debugger front-end is that it looks like shell commands: <code>blah blah blah</code>. As opposed to <code>blah("blah","blah")</code>. And this, folks, is what I think Tcl, being a tool command language, gets right.</p>
<p>I come from the world of pop infix languages (C/Java/Python/Ruby/you name it). Tcl basically freaks me out with its two fundamental choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tcl likes literals, not variables.</strong> Tcl: <code>string, $var.</code> Pop infix: <code>"string", var</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tcl likes commands, not expressions.</strong> Tcl: <code>doit this that, [expr $this+$that]</code>. Pop infix: <code>doit("this","that"), this+that</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, pop infix languages (and I use the term in the most non-judgmental, factual way), pop infix languages are optimized for programming (duh, they are programming languages). Programming is definitions. Define a variable and it will be easy to use it, and computing hairy expressions from variables is also easy. Tcl is optimized for usage. Most of the time, users give simple commands. Command names and literal parameters are easy. If you are a sophisticated user, and you want to do <code>pmem 0 bkpt [expr [pmem 0 pc] + 1]</code>, go ahead and do it. A bit ugly, but on the other hand, simple commands are really, really simple.</p>
<p>And eventually, simple commands become all that matters for the user, because the sophisticated user grows personal shortcuts, which abstract away variables and expressions, so you end up with <code>pmem 0 bkpt nextpc</code> or something. Apparently, <em>flat function calls with literal arguments is what interactive program usage is all about.</em></p>
<p>I'm not saying that I'm going to use Tcl as the extension language of my next self-made lovecraftian toolchain (I was thinking more along the lines of doing that one in D and using D as my scripting language, 'cause it compiles fast enough and it's apparently high-level enough). I haven't thought enough about this, but the grotesque escaping/quoting in Tcl still freaks me out; I don't want to <em>program</em> like that. All I'm saying is that I like the <em>interactive</em> part. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short code matters a lot; short interactive commands matter <strong>much</strong> more.</li>
<li>An interactive command language must be a real language (loops, functions and all).</li>
<li>Tcl allows for the shortest commands and it's a real language. I'm <em>fascinated</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>Short code vs short commands</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people have noticed that keeping your code short is extremely important. More surprisingly, many people fail to notice this, probably because "1 line is better than 5" doesn't sound that convincing. OK, think about 100K lines vs 500K and you'll get the idea. Oh, there are also those dirty Perl/shell one-liners that make one doubt about this. I've known a Bastard Programmer that used 2K bash one-liners as his weapon of choice. OK then, so the actual rule must be "short code is good unless it's written by a bastard". But it's the same core idea.</p>
<p>So we have the Architect type, who loves lots of classes which delegate work to each other, and we have the Enlightened type, who wants to write and read less. And the Enlightened type can rant and rave all day how Python, or Ruby, or Lisp make it oh-so-easy to define data structure literals, or to factor out stuff using meta-programming, or some other thing an Architect just never gets. And I'm all with it.</p>
<p>And then we have interactive shells. And in Python it's <code>doit("xx","yy")</code>. And in Lisp it's <code>(doit "xx" "yy")</code>, or <code>(doit :xx :yy)</code>, or <code>(doit xx yy)</code> if you make it a macro. And in Ruby it's <code>doit :xx :yy</code>, if you use symbols and omit parens. And that's about as good as you can get without using your own parser as in <code>doit "xx yy"</code>, which can suck in the (more rare) case when you do need to evaluate expressions before passing parameters, and doesn't completely remove overhead. Also note how all these languages use (), which makes you press Shift, instead of [] which doesn't. Ruby and Perl let you omit (), …</p></div></div>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-3/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we finished adding
the rest of the constants as tagged pointer immediates. Since it’s not very
useful to have only values (no way to operate on them), we’re going to add some
<em>primitive unary functions</em>.</p>

<p>“Primitive” means here that they are built into the compiler, so we won’t
actually compile the call to an assembly procedure call. This is also called a
<em>compiler intrinsic</em>. “Unary” means the functions will take only one argument.
“Function” is a bit of a misnomer because these functions won’t be real values
that you can pass around as variables. You’ll only be able to use them as
literal names in calls.</p>

<p>Though we’re still not adding a reader/parser, we can imagine the syntax for
this looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>integer?</span> <span>(</span><span>integer-&gt;char</span> <span>(</span><span>add1</span> <span>96</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Today we also tackle <em>nested</em> function calls and subexpressions.</p>

<p>Adding function calls will require adding a new compiler datastructure, an
addition to the AST, but <em>not</em> to the compiled code. The compiled code will
still only know about the immediate types.</p>

<p>Ghuloum proposes we add the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add1</code>, which takes an integer and adds 1 to it</li>
  <li><code>sub1</code>, which takes an integer and subtracts 1 from it</li>
  <li><code>integer-&gt;char</code>, which takes an integer and converts it into a character
(like <code>chr</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>char-&gt;integer</code>, which takes a character and converts it into an integer
(like <code>ord</code> in Python)</li>
  <li><code>null?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>nil</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>zero?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>0</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>not</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is <code>false</code> and false
otherwise</li>
  <li><code>integer?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is an integer and
false otherwise</li>
  <li><code>bool?</code>, which takes an object and returns true if it is a boolean and
false otherwise</li>
</ul>

<p>The functions <code>add1</code>, <code>sub1</code>, and the <code>char</code>/<code>integer</code> conversion functions
will be our first real experience dealing with object encoding in the compiled
code. What fun!</p>

<p>The implementations for <code>null?</code>, <code>zero?</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>integer</code>?, and <code>bool?</code> are so
similar that I am only going to reproduce one or two in this post. The rest
will be visible at
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/tekknolagi.github.com/blob/3d956655e48a124e828a8847282caa71b1c8b63f/assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c">assets/code/lisp/compiling-unary.c</a>.</p>

<p>In order to implement these functions, we’ll also need some more instructions
than <code>mov</code> and <code>ret</code>. Today we’ll add:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>add</code></li>
  <li><code>sub</code></li>
  <li><code>shl</code></li>
  <li><code>shr</code></li>
  <li><code>or</code></li>
  <li><code>and</code></li>
  <li><code>cmp</code></li>
  <li><code>setcc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Because the implementations of <code>shl</code>, <code>shr</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>and</code> are so
straightforward — just like <code>mov</code>, really — I’ll also omit them from the
post. The implementations of <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>cmp</code>, and <code>setcc</code> are more
interesting.</p>

<h3 id="the-fundamental-data-structure-of-lisp">The fundamental data structure of Lisp</h3>

<p>Pairs, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cells</a>,
two-tuples, and probably other things too, are the fundamental data structure
of Lisp. At least the original Lisp. Nowadays we have fancy structures like
vectors, too.</p>

<p>Pairs are a container for precisely two other objects. I’ll call them <code>car</code> and
<code>cdr</code> for historical<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and consistency reasons, but you can call them
whatever you like. Regardless of name, they could be represented as a C struct
like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is useful for holding pairs of objects (think coordinates, complex
numbers, …) but it is also incredibly useful for making linked lists. Linked
lists in Lisp are comprised of a <code>car</code> holding an object and the <code>cdr</code> holding
another list. Eventually the last <code>cdr</code> holds <code>nil</code>, signifying the end of the
list. Take a look at this handy diagram.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/lisp/03_lists_cons.svg">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cons cell list, courtesy of Wikipedia.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This represents the list <code>(list 42 69 613)</code>, which can also be denoted <code>(cons
42 (cons 69 (cons 613 nil)))</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll use these lists to represent the syntax trees for Lisp, so we’ll need to
implement pairs to compile list programs.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-pairs">Implementing pairs</h3>

<p>In previous posts we implemented the immediate types the same way in the
compiler and in the compiled code. I originally wrote this post doing the same
thing: manually laying out object offsets myself, reading and writing from
objects manually. The motivation was to get you familiar with the memory
layout in the compiled code, but ultimately it ended up being too much content
too fast. We’ll get to memory layouts when we start allocating pairs in the
compiled code.</p>

<p>In the compiler we’re going to use C structs instead of manual memory layout.
This makes the code a little bit easier to read. We’ll still tag the pointers,
though.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kPairTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span><span>;</span>        <span>// 0b001</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>0x7</span><span>);</span>  <span>// 0b000...0111</span>
<span>const</span> <span>uword</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span> <span>=</span> <span>~</span><span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b1111...1000</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds the pair tag and some masks. As we noted in the previous posts, the
heap object tags are all in the lowest three bits of the pointer. We can mask
those out using this handy utility function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>uword</span> <span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>obj</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapPtrMask</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll need to use this whenever we want to actually access a struct member.
Speaking of struct members, here’s the definition of <code>Pair</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pair</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>car</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cdr</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Pair</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And here are some functions for allocating and manipulating the <code>Pair</code> struct,
to keep the implementation details hidden:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>tag</span><span>,</span> <span>uword</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There a couple important things to note.</p>

<p>First, <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> very intentionally zeroes out the memory it allocates.
If the members were left uninitialized, it might be possible to read off a
struct member that had an invalid pointer in <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code>. If we
zero-initialize it, the member pointers represent the object <code>0</code> by default.
Nothing will crash.</p>

<p>Second, we keep moving our <code>ASTNode</code> pointers through <code>AST_as_pair</code>. This
function has two purposes: catch invalid uses (via the <code>assert</code> that the object
is indeed a <code>Pair</code>) and also mask out the lower bits. Otherwise we’d have to do
the masking in every operation individually.</p>

<p>Third, I abstracted out the <code>AST_heap_alloc</code> so we don’t expose the <code>calloc</code>
function everywhere. This allows us to later swap out the allocator for
something more intelligent, like a bump allocator, an arena allocator, etc.</p>

<p>And since memory allocated must eventually be freed, there’s a freeing function
too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>AST_is_heap_object</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_car</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
    <span>AST_heap_free</span><span>(</span><span>AST_pair_cdr</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>free</span><span>((</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_address</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This assumes that each <code>ASTNode*</code> owns the references to all of its members. So
<strong>don’t borrow references</strong> to share between objects. If you need to store a
reference to an object, <strong>make sure you own it</strong>. Otherwise you’ll get a double
free. In practice this shouldn’t bite us too much because each program is one
big tree.</p>

<h3 id="implementing-symbols">Implementing symbols</h3>

<p>We also need symbols! I mean, we could try mapping all the functions we need to
integers, but that wouldn’t be very fun. Who wants to try and debug a program
crashing on <code>function#67</code>? Not me. So let’s add a datatype that can represent
names of things.</p>

<p>As above, we’ll need to tag the pointers.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x5</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 0b101</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then our struct definition.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Symbol</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>cstr</span><span>[];</span>
<span>}</span> <span>Symbol</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve chosen this variable-length object representation because it’s similar to
how we’re going to allocate symbols in assembly and the mechanism in C isn’t so
gnarly. This struct indicates that the memory layout of a <code>Symbol</code> is a length
field immediately followed by that number of bytes in memory. Note that having
this variable array in a struct is a <strong>C99 feature</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have C99 or don’t like this implementation, that’s fine. Just
store a <code>char*</code> and allocate another object for that string.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could also opt to not store the length <em>at all</em> and instead NUL-terminate
it. This has the advantage of not dealing with variable-length arrays (it’s
just a tagged <code>char*</code>) but has the disadvantage of an <code>O(n)</code> length lookup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we can add our <code>Symbol</code> allocator:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>

<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>data_length</span> <span>=</span> <span>strlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>// for NUL</span>
  <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_heap_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>kSymbolTag</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>Symbol</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>);</span>
  <span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>length</span> <span>=</span> <span>data_length</span><span>;</span>
  <span>memcpy</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cstr</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>data_length</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>node</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how we have to manually specify the size we want. It’s a little fussy, but
it works.</p>

<p>Storing the NUL byte or not is up to you. It saves one byte per string if you
don’t, but it makes printing out strings in the debugger a bit of a pain since
you can’t just treat them like normal C strings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some Lisp implementations use a <em>symbol table</em> to ensure that symbols
allocated with equivalent C-string values return <em>the same pointer</em>. This
allows the implementations to test for symbol equality by testing pointer
equality. I think we can sacrifice a bit of memory and runtime speed for
implementation simplicity, so I’m not going to do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s add the rest of the utility functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>((</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>kHeapTagMask</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>kSymbolTag</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Symbol</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_as_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>assert</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

						<p>Why do psychiatric conditions exist?</p>
<p>This question is both unsatisfyingly unanswered and incredibly important. Here we will consider some features of the over-century-long failure of psychiatry to explain mental disorders, before reviewing a theoretical framework which promises to explain these conditions in a way which is not only scientifically sound, but emancipating. The framework in question is evolutionary psychiatry, and its principle thinking is simple: if we use evolutionary theory to explain biology, then we should be using evolutionary theory to explain psychiatric disorder. If evolution was given proper attention and integrated into mainstream psychiatry, we would usher in a new era of understanding and treatment of psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is a practice with more than a chequered past, perpetrating horrors even in living memory: Sprees of lobotomising adults and children; purposefully inducing comas in schizophrenics, producing thrashing, spasming and salivating so bad that one psychiatrist reported the scene on a ward as alike to artist Gustave Dore’s depictions of hell; and the widespread demonisation of homosexuality justifying the electrocution and injection of homosexuals with nauseating drugs during slideshows of sexually attractive individuals of the same sex, hoping to train them into being sick at their own sexuality.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the decades have come more from the dismissal of old and harmful practices than the inception of new ones. As electrocution and nauseation were slowly recognised as both immoral and ineffective, we are now left with psychotherapies and pharmaceuticals of unreliable and underwhelming efficacy. Tens of billions of dollars and several decades of research have led to few new discoveries. Many drug developers have now left psychiatry for more easily understood and chemically pliable conditions of the body rather than the mind. Leaders in national mental health research have expressed dismay that so little progress has been made. Some research suggests that the burden of psychiatric illness might even be <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acps.13083">worsening</a>, not lessening.</p>
<p>Psychiatric therapies have never been atheoretical – psychiatrists have always justified their treatments with some school of thought: Freudian psychodynamic theories placed blame on early childhood and subconscious urges; behaviourism justified the application of pain to try and train people out of wrongthink; and more recently, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315533279_Challenging_the_Narrative_of_Chemical_Imbalance_A_Look_at_the_Evidence">chemical imbalance theories</a> were used to advertise pharmaceuticals, despite the narrative of simple dopamine and serotonin dysfunctions having been <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">long dismissed</a> in academic circles. Recent advances in genetics and neuroscience have provided more evidence and complexity, but no promising new theories. Psychiatry today can be considered <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mind-Fixers-Psychiatrys-Troubled-Biology/dp/0393071227">a discipline in crisis</a>, surviving only because psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are effective for some people, some of the time, and so we still need them. The way is open for a new paradigm in psychiatric theorising.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the conclusion of his first edition of <i>Origin of Species</i> in 1859, Charles Darwin prophesied: “In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”</p>
<p>Darwin’s prophecy manifested itself in psychology around 100 years after his writing. Now, evolutionary psychology has become a common reference point for public discussion and academic research. Evolutionary psychiatry is a late follower, arising in the last years of the twentieth century alongside evolutionary medicine, its foundational work owing to Randolph Nesse, George Williams, John Price, and others.</p>
<p>Evolution by natural selection is the metatheory of biology, linking all species and all biological forms. The process of constant biological variation, reproduction and selection between forms leads to evolution of populations, explaining the form of our bodies and minds. Therefore, the logic of evolutionary medicine and psychiatry goes, evolutionary theory should also be referred to in explaining why our bodies and minds are vulnerable to disorder and disease. All biology is evolutionary, and psychiatry is biological, hence psychiatry should be understood in evolutionary terms. The lack of progress in understanding psychiatric disorders makes sense in this light, because mainstream psychiatry has been ignoring the key theory in biology.</p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles of evolutionary psychiatry have been defined, and important works <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Reasons-Bad-Feelings-Evolutionary-ebook/dp/B078VXFZCX">published</a>, there does not yet exist a dedicated evolutionary psychiatry university department or journal. In 2016, the first noteworthy institutional group dedicated to evolutionary psychiatry <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046779/">was formed</a>, in the Evolutionary Psychiatry Special Interest Group (EPSIG) at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This slow start and long build up does not dissuade evolutionary psychiatrists from believing that, in the ever-less-distant future, this theoretical paradigm will be recognised as the way to truly start explaining mental disorder.</p>
<p>A unique advantage of evolutionary psychiatry is its ability to define disease and disorder upon an evolutionary concept of dysfunction. The current diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), defines mental disorder as dysfunction, but then fails to specify what that means. This allows transparently unscientific activities. Most famously, in 1973, after gay rights protestors had stormed an APA meeting, psychiatrists had donned anonymising hoods and professed their personal homosexuality to a group of their fellows, and national progressive values became a little too loud to ignore, the APA called a vote to reconsider homosexuality’s status as a mental disorder. By a 58% majority, it was struck off.</p>
<p>Voting to decide whether a condition is a disease is not the sign of a mature science, yet to this day consensus alone is the deciding factor of whether a mind is deemed disorderly. Commonly prescribed disorder labels in use today, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, included in the DSM-III because of the vote of a dozen or so psychiatrists, have criteria <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650639/">based primarily upon</a> single review papers with poor empirical evidence from the 1970’s – even the authors of that paper expected it to be backed up with further evidence before becoming part of canon. In the most recent edition, the DSM-5, ‘internet gaming disorder’ was suggested, justified by comparing online (but specifically excluding offline) gaming to drug and gambling addictions. An international consortium has since <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.12457">voted</a> clarifying its features. Evolutionary psychiatry can thankfully supersede this ambiguous line between order and disorder.</p>
<p>Unlike physics and chemistry, which describe things simply as they are, biological processes can be meaningfully considered to function or dysfunction. Biological traits evolved to increase reproductive success – that is their function. Eyes evolved to see, so eyes which cannot see are dysfunctional. Psychological and physical traits functioned to provide reproductive success to our ancestors, and where that function fails or is interrupted, there is dysfunction. Mental disorders can then be defined as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119125563.evpsych242">harmful dysfunctions</a> of the mind.</p>
<p>This analysis of function is inevitably historical (it concerns ancestral evolutionary function, not modern functioning) and so is difficult to ascertain in many cases, especially in psychology, and is complicated by the possibility of random processes of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genetic-drift/">genetic drift</a>. Nevertheless, this reference to evolutionary function is the <i>only</i> way to define function by an objective biological process rather than relying solely on subjective norms and cultural values – or indeed a vote.</p>
<p>This unique theoretical strength has been followed up by work in evolutionary medicine and psychiatry identifying <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Articles/Nesse%20-%202015%20-%20Evolutionary%20Psychology%20and%20Mental%20Health.pdf">six reasons</a> why conditions we define as disorder or disease (of body or mind) persist in evolved creatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constraints on biological design, because evolution can only make alterations within a certain range.</li>
<li>Pathogens evolve, so we cannot evolve perfect immunity against them.</li>
<li>Design trade-offs and byproducts make perfection impossible.</li>
<li>Evolved defenses against disease and danger often induce harmful symptoms.</li>
<li>Selection is for reproductive success, not health, so we can evolve in ways which are debilitating if they allow us to reproduce more successfully.</li>
<li>Mismatch between evolved systems and modern environments lead to novel, harmful, reactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these six reasons, it’s important to note that the last four are the modern result of functioning rather than dysfunctioning processes. The idea that natural selection would only encourage perfect health is mistaken. It’s entirely possible for evolution to lead our bodies and minds into states which we now diagnose and treat as disorders or diseases.</p>
<p>Work in evolutionary psychiatry has considered <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29051086/">depression</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/1/5229271">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/hunters-in-a-farmers-world-adhd-and-hunter-gatherers-2332-0915-1000150.pdf">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16005572/">OCD</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9875960/">eating disorders</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">substance use disorders</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674370304800107">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603205_In_cold_blood_The_evolution_of_psychopathy">psychopathy</a>, and many more disorders through the evolutionary framework. Several can be explained as mental tendencies related to adaptations which were advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors.</p>
<p>For instance, some are mismatched psychological systems which are exposed to over-stimulation in the modern environment, becoming the biggest causes of abuse, ruination and early death in developed countries. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881888/">Alcoholism and drug abuse</a> manipulate natural chemical pathways which exist for evolutionarily advantageous reasons; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25749980/">obesity</a> by overeating is caused by natural desires for sweet and fatty foods; and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15577272/">gambling addiction</a> is likely linked to a history of continuously searching for scarce high-calorie food and other risky but rewarding endeavours.</p>

<p>After years of using LibreOffice, I’ve now switched over to ONLYOFFICE and recommend it over any other office suite on Linux. Now I know a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> enthusiasts will be unhappy about the idealistic part of the recommendation, but hear me out.</p>



<h2><strong>Top notch Microsoft Office compatibility</strong></h2>



<p>I’m a<a href="https://jatan.space/"> science writer</a> who uses Linux because it just functions better for me than Windows or macOS and because I’m an open source enthusiast. Given my profession, I have to frequently collaborate with people on other operating systems who almost always use either Microsoft Office or Google Docs. After three years of trying, I can tell you that LibreOffice just doesn’t cut it. Either me or the other person will lose some formatting in the documents at some point. And as a document travels from one computer to another, things quickly become a mess.</p>



<p>That is when I found ONLYOFFICE. In over a year of using it, I’ve sent ONLYOFFICE created documents, spreadsheets and presentations to people using Microsoft Office, iWork, smartphone editors, Google Docs, etc., did multiple to and fro edits and it hasn’t broken <em>a single thing</em>! This is something I cannot ignore as a writer and my experience attests to ONLYOFFICE’s claim of top notch Microsoft Office compatibility.</p>



<h2><strong>More features</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond the excellent compatibility with Microsoft Office files, there are other features that make ONLYOFFICE a better alternative to LibreOffice, WPS or any other Linux office suite that I’ve used.</p>



<ul><li>All documents open in the same window as multiple tabs and you can manipulate them just like you’d in a browser. This is amazing.</li><li>Can connect to Nextcloud or OwnCloud for online and collaborative features like Google Docs.</li><li>Unlike LibreOffice, ONLYOFFICE has adequately functional and maintained mobile &amp; tablet apps on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onlyoffice.documents">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onlyoffice-documents/id944896972">iOS</a>.</li><li>Has Ribbon UI, so in my opinion things are easier to find on ONLYOFFICE compared to LibreOffice’s <strong>“Default”</strong> UI.</li><li>Open source, making it more trustworthy than WPS Office and other proprietary solutions on Linux.</li><li>Available on Windows and macOS too if you don’t want to use Microsoft Office or simply can’t afford its licensing fee.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Go get it</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200" alt="" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=400 400w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/onlyoffice-logo.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></figure></div>



<p>ONLYOFFICE is officially available to <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-desktop.aspx">download</a> on Linux as a Deb, RPM, Flatpak and a Snap package so you can use it on any Linux distro you like!</p>



<p>I hope I’ve convinced you to give ONLYOFFICE a shot and see if it solves your problems. If it doesn’t, you can file bugs and feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors">their GitHub repository</a>. In my experience, they’ve been very open to feature suggestions and prompt on bug fixes.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>My ideals for FOSS dwindled swiftly when I had to make something work in the real world. Not everyone can use everything truly FOSS all the time. At least ONLYOFFICE is open source (<a href="https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors/blob/master/LICENSE">AGPL-3.0, specifically</a>) and not proprietary like Microsoft Office. Bottomline, ONLYOFFICE is a fantastic office suite that I hope more people discover.</p>

<p>Permutation City is a great novel with a very interesting philosophical argument embedded inside it. Many people don’t want to read the whole novel, so here is my short explanation of Egan’s Dust Theory.</p>



<p>If you think experience is simulatable, you buy computational or “patternist” theories of identity, there are some very strange implications that are not commonly brought up. </p>



<p>Because computation is sort of subjective, just a set of relations that can be usefully interpreted as representing a function, this seems to imply that the function you identify with can be interpreted as being simulated by any sufficiently complex set of relations. </p>



<p>That is, for any random set of relations with enough complexity to represent a human mind, Egan claims, there exists an exotic encoding scheme that can interpret this set of relations as representing any arbitrary function, including the function that you would call “I”.</p>



<p>Now you cannot access this information usefully, so most functions can be said to not usefully exist within this randomness. But if you buy the whole “I think therefore I am” business this does not matter for those functions that are conscious, because consciousness is self-justifying. </p>



<p>So the function that is you is being “run” far more often in random noise than engineered computers or ‘real’ physical reality. This is sort of like the Boltzmann brain idea but even worse because it applies to any set of relations. According to Egan’s argument all possible experiences that can be computed by any sufficiently complex set of relations are in fact computed by them. </p>



<p>In fact, even if you imagine a static set of relations that do not evolve in time there still exists encoding schemes that can interpret this set of relations as any arbitrary function, so in some sense the set of mathematical objects that represent “you” and “me” and all possible minds can be said to exist in these timeless relations. </p>



<p>Egan discusses some counterarguments to the idea here: <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html">https://www.gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html</a></p>

September 5, 2020 | https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.reenigne.org/blog/8086-microcode-disassembled/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>



<pre>MOV rm&lt;-&gt;r     4  3

INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>

<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>The article has been updated to accommodate changes since the original four months ago.</p></blockquote>



<p>Like everyone else, I got excited about the latest Ubuntu LTS release, 20.04, and installed it on day one. A month in, I’m sorry to say that I leave disappointed. The amount of unready <em>snap</em> features being effectively forced onto Ubuntu is affecting my usability and user-friendliness.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="409" height="230" srcset="https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=409 409w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=200 200w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg?w=300 300w, https://uncertainquarkhome.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ubuntu-snap.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Software center can’t install Flatpak apps</strong></h2>



<p>In 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu’s Software Center was switched from being a .deb version of GNOME Software to a <em>snap</em> app. The new snapped store can handle management of <em>snap</em> applications and traditional .deb ones, but it can’t install or remove Flatpak applications, like the .deb version could.</p>



<p>Users wanting to install Flatpak apps <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/25/how-to-install-flatpak-apps-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts/">need to revert to using the .deb version</a>. It’s not an ideal solution when previous Ubuntu Software releases could handle all three formats. In all, the latest Ubuntu Software is a step back.</p>



<h2><strong>Browsing the Snap Store sucks</strong></h2>



<p>Good apps, and finding them, are central to the success of any modern operating system. Even without Flatpak apps, I was expecting the snapped store to at least do what it’s supposed to do well–help find apps. It turns out that instead Ubuntu prioritizes snap apps over .deb ones in store search results at any cost! So you’ll see a long list of non relevant entries of snap apps above .deb ones, even if your search term exactly matches the latter. -_-</p>



<p>Needless to say this is a serious issue for discovering software, especially for users switching from Windows or Mac. The snapped store isn’t just a step back, but is downright unreliable.</p>



<h2><strong>Slow and forced Chromium snap</strong></h2>



<p>On the latest Ubuntu, if you try to download the .deb version of Chromium using either the Software Store or the command line, it acts as an alias and installs the snap version! Essentially, Chromium snap is shoved down your throat even if you explicitly asked for the .deb version. This is not cool Ubuntu; Just because Chromium may be easier to maintain as a snap app doesn’t justify this forced behavior.</p>



<p>Besides, a typical user doesn’t care how the app is managed in the backend, all they care about is how it works. And that’s another place where snaps don’t shine. They are slow. I hate that Chromium’s snap takes more than 10 seconds to load on cold boot on a freaking SSD, whereas .deb and Flatpak apps load in 1-2 seconds. Snaps are simply not fast enough to be default <em>anything</em> yet.</p>



<h2><strong>No control over updates</strong></h2>



<p>Snap applications auto-update and that’s fine if Ubuntu wants to keep systems secure. But it can’t even be turned off manually. Auto-updating of snaps can only be deferred at best, until at some point, like Windows, it auto-updates anyway. Even on metered connections, snaps auto-update after a threshold time. This is unacceptable. Even Apple has easy options to disable automatic software updates.</p>



<p>Ubuntu’s update process with 20.04 LTS is a deal breaker for people on limited bandwidth connections or who want to know exactly what they’re updating and when they’d like to. Even at best, this behavior is causing me issues like slowing down my connection abruptly and using a major chunk of my limited data for the day. My <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/is-ubuntu-software-going-to-be-remove-for-snap-snap-store/14542/25?u=uncertainquark">discussion on the Ubuntu forums</a> on the topic and many such raised issues by others didn’t go well, read the <em>full thread</em> if interested.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Ubuntu was my first Linux-based operating system and is what attracted me to the ecosystem. I have a soft spot for it, especially the amazing Unity days. As such, it is disappointing to see this snap obsession that has taken over Ubuntu. An OS once lauded for its sane defaults and user friendliness is actively going against the user’s will.</p>



<p>What’s especially concerning is that this is the Ubuntu version that millions of people will use for at least two years. I don’t hate snaps but being forced to use it especially when in a clearly premature state is forcing me to hate it. Snaps simply aren’t ready for system-wide daily usage and Ubuntu should’ve known better. Perhaps Ubuntu should’ve created a separate snap-based OS image, like Fedora’s <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-silverblue/">Silverblue</a>, and only swap the default when it’s ready.</p>



<p>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS’ snap obsession has snapped me off of it. I have switched to macOS as my daily driver, for many other reasons. I don’t have the time to keep fixing things on Linux Desktop and be constantly finding ways to work around standard OS features that should otherwise just be available and work.</p>



<p>For those on Linux, I recommend using <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS 20.04</a> instead of Ubuntu as it is basically Ubuntu but without the snap, and some unique features. <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary OS</a> is what I use on my now secondary device, mainly because of its <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/">app ecosystem</a>, <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/03/21/why-i-love-elementary-os-file-manager/">excellent file manager</a> and the <a href="https://personal.jatan.space/2020/04/04/my-contributions-to-elementary-os-and-how-you-can-too/">welcoming nature</a> of their developers for contributions and suggestions.</p>

        <p>
          This article dives into the architecture and design of Radicle Link—the peer-to-peer replication
          protocol that powers Radicle. We discuss our decision to build on Git, how we ensure data availability,
          and how we replicate data across the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind every repository is a version control system—the most popular of these being Git, created in
          2005 by Linus Torvalds for the development of the Linux kernel. Git marked the rise of distributed version
          control systems as developers realized the centralized model of SVN and CVS didn't scale well with the
          number of contributors. In fact, Git was only created when Linus’ free <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.org/">Bitkeeper</a> license was revoked after a Linux kernel contributor tried to
          <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">reverse engineer its networking protocols</a>.
          Git brought distributed version control to the forefront and changed the way software is developed today.

        <p>
          Code collaboration platforms, or <q>forges</q>, started building on top of Git: they introduced
          search and discovery, canonicity, and social collaboration (issues &amp; code review) to Git-based workflows,
          albeit not always following the same distributed model that Git was designed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle was designed to provide this same functionality while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on
          what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Git gossips well
        </h2>
        <p>
          The earliest version of Radicle adopted a generalized approach to replication—it wasn’t tailored to
          replicating collaboration artifacts or source code and as we discovered, was ill-suited to the demands of
          real-world code collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the current iteration is specifically designed for this use case. The most outstanding
          difference is the decision to <strong>use Git as our storage and replication layer</strong>, instead of a
          decentralized storage network such as IPFS. In our experimentation with decentralized storage, we realized
          that replicating Git repos on the storage layer didn't permit the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Packfiles">packfiles</a>, one of the key protocols that
          makes Git useable at scale.  Essentially, this approach would make source code a second-class citizen—
          making it impractical to store repositories with large histories. The reason is simple: <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Transfer-Protocols">the packfile protocol is
          interactive</a>, which means before data is transferred between two parties, they determine exactly what needs
          to be sent over the wire, and the server puts together a packfile on the fly, before sending it downstream.
          This incredibly efficient approach isn't compatible with simple file storage protocols such as IPFS,
          which operate on the premise that content is usually <em>static</em>, unlike active code repositories that are
          constantly updated.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can't handle writing of data from the client
            to the server.  The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process
            on the remote end that is intelligent about Git—it can read local data, figure out what the client has and
            needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In order to keep Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication, while offering global decentralized
          repository storage, we chose to design Radicle as a peer-to-peer networking layer on top of Git's smart
          transfer protocol. Radicle would take care of discovering peers, offloading the actual data transfer to Git.
        </p>

        <h2>

        </h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link">Radicle Link</a> is a peer-to-peer protocol with a
          generic distributed version control backend. It aims to be general enough to be used on top of systems such as
          <a href="https://pijul.org/">pijul</a> or <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">mercurial</a>, though
          it's initial implementation is focused on supporting Git.
        </p>
        <p>
          Radicle Link extends Git with <strong>peer-to-peer network discovery</strong>. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, a peer-to-peer protocol for social networking, data is
          disseminated via a process called <strong>gossip</strong>. That is, participants in the network share and
          spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing deltas with peers. With
          Radicle, we replicate data across connected repositories according to a “social graph” of contributors and
          maintainers, enabling source code and changesets to be disseminated according to use and value: the more peers
          who are interested in a certain project, the more available this project is made to the network.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How it works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Repositories are the base <em>unit of replication</em> in Radicle. To publish a repository to the network, it
          must first be initialized as a <em>project</em>. Projects combine source code, issues and proposed changes
          under a single umbrella, and carry a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identifier. The entirety of the project
          data and metadata, including social artefacts such as comments, are stored within the repository. To create a
          project, the owner of a repository defines a <em>project identity</em>. In the background, a
          <em>project.json</em> file is created in a predetermined disjoint branch of the repository, by convention
          <code>rad/id</code>. This file contains important metadata such as the project name, list of maintainers, as
          well as any related links.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of the repository thus becomes the founder of the project and signs the initial version of the
          project metadata file (<em>project.json</em>) with their private key. The digest of the initial version,
          becomes the <em>Project ID</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the repository, a Radicle <em>project</em> includes the <em>identities</em> of all its
          maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's identity. Initially, the only
          maintainer is the <em>founder</em>. By adding other maintainers to the project metadata, additional layers of
          trust can be introduced around the project. Any update to the project metadata <strong>must</strong> be signed
          by a quorum of maintainers, providing a cryptographically secure way to manage project state &amp; metadata,
          for example in the case of transferring ownership. The history of the metadata file is backed by the
          underlying DVCS, and is verified upon replication,  ensuring it was't tampered with.
        </p>

        <h3>Replication and validation</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure data integrity and authenticity in the peer-to-peer network, we adopt an algorithm similar to the
          root file update process from <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a> (TUF). In this
          process, peers can fetch and verify the project metadata before replicating the latest changesets and
          revisions. This is important, since it effectively allows data to be served by <em>any peer</em>, in a secure
          manner. The physical location from which project data is fetched becomes irrelevant to the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Tracking and discovery</h3>
        <p>
          When a project is published to the network the specific repository or <em>source tree</em> becomes
          identifiable by the maintainer of this tree. This allows repositories to be addressed by a shareable URL,
          which is then resolved to a physical location on the network, for the purpose of replication. This URL has the
          following form:
        </p>
        <pre>rad://&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;maintainer-id&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Peers decide what data to replicate through the <strong>tracking</strong> of projects. Tracking a project
          signals interest, and means to impliestracking its maintainers, therefore replicating the data within their
          social graphs. In the context of a project, maintainers of a repository may choose to <strong>track</strong>
          the repositories of other owners (this is called a <strong>remote</strong> in Git terminology: a named
              reference to a remote repository). If the remote repository is found to track other remotes, the tracking
          repository shall also transitively track those, up to a configurable <em>N</em> degrees out.

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          To improve data availability, participants in the network can choose to act as <strong>seeds</strong>. This is
          similar in concept to a <em>pub</em> in <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>: seeds
          are <q>always-on</q> nodes that automatically track discovered projects, thereby increasing the availability of
          these projects on the network. Since seeds may track a large number of repositories for a given project,
          replicating a project from a seed will greatly increase the connectedness of the tracking graph. Tracking a
          seed will also increase the number of paths leading back to the original upstream, ensuring that contributions
          can flow back up to the project maintainers even if they come from participants not within the set of tracked
          repositories of the maintainer.

        <p>
          With the introduction of hosted platforms came new ‘enhanced’ workflows like pull requests, issue tracking,
          and code reviews. These workflows were unique because they were non-Git native but still tied to source code
          through rich user interfaces and features. As a result, they have further defined the common developer
          experience by making collaboration more than just code—the social interactions captured in issues,
          code …</p></article></div></section></div>
