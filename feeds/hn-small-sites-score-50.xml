<p>While listening to a <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/12/02/bgp-with-andree-toonk/">podcast discussing BGP</a> I heard the fact that AWS owns more than $2B worth of IP addresses. I knew AWS was massive but this came as a big shock so I decided to do some digging around. I came across a <a href="https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/">site</a> that listed the market prices of IP addresses and the range looks to be anywhere from $20 to $30 per IP depending on the block size. Now it was time to figure out the IP addresses owned by Amazon. I figured this would be difficult but lucky for us AWS actually <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">publishes</a> their entire set of IP addresses as JSON.</p>

<p>The work is simply to download the JSON and then convert the CIDR blocks to the number of IPs and add them all up. As of today, December 11, 2020 AWS self reports owning 109,847,486 IPV4 addresses - at a price of $20 this is almost $2.2B and at $30 it’s almost $3.3B. That’s wild.</p>

	  <p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot</a> is a low-cost robot kit for students, software engineers, makers to learn <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/">ROS2</a> and robotics in a hands-on manner. Our robot kits are easy to build, extensible, and customizable. The Hadabot software stack consists of an open source web browser-based coding environment to make the hacking experience frustration-free.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hadabot.com/">Hadabot ROS2 "Turtle" robot kits are available for purchase</a>!</p>
<hr>
<p>In a previous post, we showcased the <a href="https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim/">ROS 2 turtlesim</a> running with the <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/">Navigation2 (aka Nav2)</a> package. That exercise required the use of the <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/tf2">tf2</a> which manages all <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/ros2-navigation-tf2-tutorial-using-turtlesim.html#what-is-tf2">the various coordinate frames of a robotics application</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, instead of turtlesim, we'll have Nav2 direct a physical Hadabot Turtle differential drive robot to a goal pose - position and orientation. This exercise will bring together rviz, tf2, Nav2 with our past writeups about the <a href="https://blog.hadabot.com/implement-ros2-odometry-using-vscode-in-web-browser.html">Turtle robot's odometry and kinematics</a>. We'll touch upon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How we compute odometry for Nav2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nav2 parameters we tweaked</p>

<h3>1. ROS 2 Nav2 with a Hadabot Turtle robot</h3>
<p>As with all Hadabot examples, you can use the Hadabot stacks browser-based VSCode to compile and run the code.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up / update your turn-key Hadabot software stack (which leverages Docker containers to ensure your code runs securely and efficiently on your local machine):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>you are new to Hadabot</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/new-user-software-stack-setup.html" target="_blank">steps to set up Docker and get the Hadabot software stack up and running</a> (5 to 15 minutes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else if you are a <strong>returning Hadabot hacker</strong>, follow these <a href="https://www.hadabot.com/software-stack-update.html" target="_blank">steps to update your Hadabot software stack</a> (1-3 minutes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://localhost:9123/?folder=/home/hadabot/hadabot_main/content/p9" target="_blank">Launch the browser-based VSCode workspace specific to this post</a> (this link points to your localhost so everything is running securely on your local system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left VSCode Explorer panel, right-click the <strong>README.md</strong> file -&gt; Open Preview.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the README to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update your ROS 2 packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flash the example's ESP32 firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle robot controller and coordinate frame code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch a browser-based VNC client to run the example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a go-to-goal Navigation2 Hadabot Turtle example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

        </p>

<h5>Rviz to visualize the Nav2 go-to-goal Hadabot Turtle example</h5>
<p>If you successfully ran the example, you'll notice that the Turtle starts in the middle of the "arena" (ie map). Each grid-box represents 1 meter in physical distance. The red-axis presents the Turtle pointed forward. Since ROS uses a right-handed coordinate system, positive <span>\(\omega\)</span> rotation results in the Turtle turning counter-clockwise. </p>
<p>For the video example, the goal pose was 1 meter to the Turtle's left, with a 90 degree orientation from its initial orientation. </p>
<p>Notice the Turtle didn't end up exactly 1 meter to its left, nor was it oriented exactly 90 degrees from its initial pose. This is due to 2 reasons due to nothing happening exactly in the real world (this is not a simulation anymore Dorothy) - (1) the Hadabot Turtle's speed sensors have errors which accumulates over time resulting in odometry drift, and (2) Nav2 goal checker allows for a tolerance in both distance and orientation from the specificed end-goal.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. How we construct TF2 messages from odometry</h3>
<p>The Hadabot Turtle publishes each wheel's rotational velocity in radians per second. With the measured wheelbase and wheel radius of the Turtle, we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead-reckoning</a> to determine how far each wheel has traveled in meters.</p>
<p>Once we know how far each wheel has traveled for our differential drive model, we can compute the linear distance and angular rotation <span>\((v, \omega)\)</span> for a unicycle model, which allows us to update the current pose and velocities of our Hadabot Turtle as an <a href="http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html">Odometry ROS message</a>. All this is done in the <em>hadabot_controller.cpp</em> file.</p>
<p>Then we use effectively the same code as the turtlesim example to extract the pose information from the Odometry message and publish that out as tf2 messages which is used by Nav2 and rviz.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Setting up Nav2 for the Hadabot Turtle</h3>
<p>Nav2 is a complex ROS 2 package with a number of sub-packages / components around 3 main capabilities - localization, planning/controller, and mapping. For our go-to-goal example, we mainly use the planning/controller component.</p>
<p>There are conceptually 2 types of planners in Nav2 - a global planner, and a local planner. The global planner computes a global trajectoy to get to our goal pose. The local planner references the global plan to determine the best linear and angular velocity for the robot to undertake to safely move along the global trajectory. </p>
<p>The global planner (as of 2020-12) defaults to a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search</a> based planner. The local planner is called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/236487972">DWB planner, initially created by David Lu back in the ROS 1 days</a>, which implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_approach">Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm</a> created by Dieter Fox, Wolfram Burgard, and Sebastian Thrun. The DWB planner is driven by "critics" which vote on various local trajectories to undertake. Each critic "cares" about a certain behavior (ie avoiding abstacles, avoiding oscillation, going fast, etc). The local trajectory with the highest vote wins and that results as the Twist message command to direct the robot's current velocities.</p>
<p>Configuring Nav2 for our go-to-goal example involved tuning the parameters for the planning/controller. The ones we tweaked for the Hadabot Turtle are the max velocities of our robot, and controller update frequency (to update frequently enough but not so much that it floods our "hobbyist" network capabilities). There are many other <a href="https://navigation.ros.org/configuration/index.html">Nav2 parameters we can consider and tune</a>, which can be a series of posts and exercises on its own. </p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this post, we did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Showed a example of running a physical real-life Hadabot Turtle robot using ROS 2 Nav2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We described how we use dead-reckoning to compute the Turtle's pose and velocities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We talked a bit about Nav2 and what we tweaked to get our goal-to-goal example to work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In future posts, we can take this exercise down 2 separate threads - (1) to walk through some of the Nav2 parameters in more detail, start looking closer at Nav2, or (2) to showcase a Hadabot Turtle with a skirt of range-sensors (add-on for the base Turtle kit) to further explore localization and then SLAM with Nav2.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are working with various professors to create a more structured ROS 2 robotics syllabus and curriculum.</p>

            <p><strong>Dec 9, 2020</strong></p>
            
            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy, intended to illustrate in the simplest possible way how specialization gets punished when transfers are taxed in proportion to their values. The current reality not <em>nearly</em> this bad due to many complex exemptions, as I discuss at the end. But the flaw described <em>does</em> exist and <em>does</em> punish specialization. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WHERE THE SAME UNIT OF VALUE IS TAXED MULTIPLE TIMES PLEASE READ THIS LINK.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconuts</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2 (raw coconut+paint)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3 (painted coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4 (finished coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The initial map is based on Wikipedia, but found that many places (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/thailand/corporate/other-taxes">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/05/tnf-saudi-arabia-vat-rate-to-increase-to-15-percent-covid-19.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Iran#Value_added_tax_(VAT)">Iran</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/om/en/pages/tax/articles/oman-to-implement-vat-from-2021.html">Oman</a>, <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/finance-and-investment/taxation/valueaddedtaxvat">UAE</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-economy-tax-idUSKCN1IG0OW">Kuwait</a>, <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/insight-early-days-for-angola-value-added-tax">Angola</a>, <a href="https://www.avalara.com/vatlive/en/vat-news/liberia-to-introduce-vat-2019.html">Liberia</a>) have recently implemented VAT. I checked that most of the others (<a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jordan/corporate/other-taxes">Jordan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="https://www.tradecommissioner.gc.ca/france/market-facts-faits-sur-le-marche/7685.aspx?lang=eng#valuetax">French Guinana</a>, <a href="https://www.nordeatrade.com/en/explore-new-market/cuba/taxes">Cuba</a>, <a href="https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/libya/individual/other-taxes">Libya</a>, Hong Hong) still do not have a VAT.</li>
  <li>To be sure, if you could implement a sales tax that only applied to final consumers, that would be economically equivalent to VAT. Is that how state taxes work in the US? It’s hard to make simple generalizations because (1) it’s sometimes hard to say what a “final consumer” is (2) there are different laws in each state and (3) the relevant tax is sometimes called a “gross receipts” tax. The important question is: <strong>Does the US have taxes on intermediate products</strong> that “cascade” like described in the above model? The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">YES</a>.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

<p>It's been a really long ride at <a href="http://cloak.ist/">Cloakist</a>.</p><p>I've been through the highest highs, and the lowest lows.</p><p>But now, looking back on it all, with $9.99 coming into my bank account every month <em>just like clockwork</em>, I can definitively say:</p><p>It's all been worth it.</p><p>Here is the story of how I managed to turn 7 years of my life into cold, hard cash.</p><p>And not just any amount of cash.</p><p>$9.99 so far.</p><h2 id="you-can-t-succeed-without-starting">You can't succeed without starting</h2><p>7 years ago, I was just another incredibly privileged highly-skilled software developer whose parents can support him indefinitely meaning he doesn't have to get a proper job and can risk it all on starting a business, even though his Uncle Les offered him a good, stable living as a junior accountant at his firm, as his mum never goddamn stops reminding him.</p><p>Today, I am the CEO of a successful startup.</p><p>How did I get there?</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>I started.</p><p>One day, I woke up and navigated to <a href="https://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a>.</p><p>You might not have heard of it if you aren't a software developer.</p><p>It's a place you go to buy startup websites.</p><p>It's really that simple. You think of a name, and then you go there and type it in.</p><p>In <em>seconds, </em>you'll have results showing you whether your name is available.</p><p>For me, it took a few tries to get it right. I started off trying <code>business.com</code> Â&nbsp;because I wanted my business to have a name that made it clear that it was a business.</p><p>But it was already taken.</p><p>So I moved onto <code>company.com</code>. That was taken too.</p><p>Eventually I landed on https://cloak.ist.</p><p>The journey had started.</p><h2 id="the-long-hard-slog">The long hard slog</h2><p>But boy, it was one hell of a journey.</p><p>This is where another key startup concept comes in:</p><p><em>The pivot.</em></p><p>I wasn't always banking hot, fresh Benjamins from selling custom domains as a service, like I do now.</p><p>I went through 365 different products <em>a year</em> before I settled on custom domains.</p><p>You might be thinking 'Huh, strange â€“ that's the exact number of days in a year'.</p><p>You've hit the nail on the head. Cloakist started off by offering NCaaS.</p><p>Neighborhood-Chores-as-a-service.</p><p>They say you should start with a problem that you see in real life.</p><p>Well, in my mum's neighborhood, I saw hundreds of problems.</p><p>And there were people willing to pay for <em>all of them!</em></p><p>There was Mr Baxter, whose toilet got blocked by his cat. That was a particularly hard pivot to make.</p><p>There were many, many clients in the plus-age category who needed ambulatory assistance with regards to pedestrian activity.</p><p>In other words, they needed help crossing the road.</p><p>And there was teaching coding to the kids at the local primary school, until the bullying became too much for me to handle.</p><p>But here's why none of those NCaaS offerings could ever have worked:</p><p><em>I wasn't getting recurring revenue.</em></p><p>None of my customers came back for a second time.</p><p>It wasn't anything to do with me. I know this because my mum told me so.

I lost all my code, because for 7 whole years I'd never figured out a way to back it up.</p><p>"You lazy, no-good piece of crap!"</p><p>My mum was angry.</p><p>I'd never <em>seen </em>her this angry.</p><p>I knew something had to change. And I got this twinkle in my eye.</p><p>"Mum, do you need a custom domain for one of your public sites like Notion, Trello, Airtable, or anything else?"</p><p>I'd found my first customer.</p><h2 id="the-negotiation">The negotiation</h2><p>But boy, did she fight me on it.</p><p>I started off asking for $100 a month, to try and recoup some of the costs of working for nothing for 7 years.</p><p>My mum wasn't having it. She didn't understand what a custom domain was, and she didn't understand what a public site was.</p><p>That severely limited the amount she was willing to pay for my solution.</p><p>I offered $50/m. She said no.</p><p>I offered $20/m. She went to take out the trash. And when she came back, she still said no.</p><p>Finally, I offered $10/m. And...</p><p>She said $9.99.</p><p>And I said...</p><p>"HELL YES!"</p><p>We both started crying.</p><p>Me, out of joy.</p><p>Her, I think out of sadness for what I am and what I've become.</p><p>But still â€“ it was raw, unfettered emotion.</p><p>The MRR had started to pour in.</p><p>And who cares if it's tied to other conditions, like me moving out and promising to think again about Uncle Les's accounting firm.</p><p>MRR is MRR. It's as simple as that.</p><h2 id="it-doesn-t-stop-there">It doesn't stop there</h2><p>The crazy thing about where I've got to now is how much momentum I'm feeling.</p><p>Next month, if all goes well, it's looking like I'll have $19.98 in my bank account.</p><p>The month after that, $29.97.</p><p>Because that's how momentum works.</p><p>Once you get it started, it just keeps going on its own.</p><p>Here's to the next 7 years!</p><hr><p>Thank you so much for reading.</p><p>Give yourself a congratulations: you've just completed Startup Lesson 101: How To Succeed.</p><p>If you'd like to enrol in further classes, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/louisbarclay">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p><p>And if you'd like to read a true, but much more boring story about getting MRR, go <a href="https://cloak.ist/blog/how-we-got-to-400-mrr-in-5-months/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Doing a bunch of Python, I <em>want this</em> in Python as well. I want a debug macro, one that gives me the file location + the expression used to calculate the value.</p>
<p>My <em>ideal</em> would be to have a function where <code>dbg(foo.bar[1])</code> that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>print <code>[source line] foo.bar[1] = &lt;the value&gt;</code></li>
<li>return the value so we can use it within expressions easily</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing this by hand I always reach for <code>f</code>-strings, to do something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"foo.bar[1]=</span><span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is annoying because you end up typing the same expression twice, you can't inline it, and it just doesn't look very cool.</p>
<p>The first thing when trying to implement this is to come to terms with Python's lack of macros. You can't really mess with the syntax tree, so you're really only operating on calculated values. So it's really hard to capture an expression <em>and its result</em> in a single operation because, well, your expressions get evaluated.</p>
<p>So it'll be hard, to print <code>some_expr = &lt;result of some_expr&gt;</code> without providing the string of <code>some_expr</code> at one point.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, thanks to <code>eval</code>, you can flip this idea on its head. You <em>need</em> the string for the expression, but you don't need the expression itself!</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'bar'</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar'[]"</span><span>))</span> <span># prints 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>One step backwards, let's now go two steps forward. We can start writing our <code>dbg</code> helper function</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"bar"</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>  <span># foo['bar'] = 3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far so good, we have a nice pretty printer here at the cost of two quotation marks.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't work perfectly:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span> <span># expr = expr</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out that when calling <code>eval</code> without arguments we are evaluating <em>within the scope of <code>dbg</code></em>. Our examples work because <code>dbg</code> is defined alongside our expressions (so <code>foo</code> is accessible within <code>dbg</code>) but it's susceptible to name shadowing or outright not being able to calculate the expression because it could be defined in a different scope</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span># we're calculating the result here....</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

<span># but actually want to calculate</span>
<span># the result within this scope</span>
<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>eval</code> by default will evaluate the expression within the current frame. But we can pass in our own globals and locals to instead evaluate the expression within an arbitrary environment</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>"x"</span><span>:</span> <span>4</span><span>}))</span> <span># gives 4</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So let's reproduce the caller's environment to get us the right results. Enter <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html"><code>inspect</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking, <em>getting source code</em>, inspecting classes and functions, and <em>examining the interpreter stack</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's try out <code>inspect.stack()</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>inspect</span>

<span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"foo['bar']"</span><span>)</span>

<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>

<span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"expr"</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>):</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Passed"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>trying this out, we get the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'    print(inspect.stack()[0].code_context)</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since this is in a function call we'll actually need to go up the stack one frame (<code>inspect.stack()[1]</code>) to get the proper line:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>'dbg("foo[</span><span>\'</span><span>bar</span><span>\'</span><span>]")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>'dbg("expr")</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>'if dbg("True"):</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span><span>]</span>
<span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
<span>Passed</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK, now we are getting closer to where we need. the second element in our stack is where we'll also get the file path and the line number. Let's clean this up a bit and now we get:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>rtpg</span><span>/</span><span>proj</span><span>/</span><span>configfiles</span><span>/</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here we have the full file path... one might do a trick here to stick with the file name:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>filename</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"[</span><span>{</span><span>filename</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>{</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>lineno</span><span>}</span><span>] </span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so with this we end up with the following nice printed output</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>expr</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK so this is good on the formatting. But we still haven't fixed <code>eval</code>! That's a tiny fix this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>):</span>
    <span>frame</span> <span>=</span> <span>inspect</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>()[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>frame</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>expr</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_globals</span><span>,</span> <span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>f_locals</span><span>)</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>expr</span><span>}</span><span> = </span><span>{</span><span>result</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>result</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This gets us the right values, properly evaluating <code>expr</code> from the calling scope instead of <code>dbg</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>21</span><span>]</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>'bar'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>25</span><span>]</span> <span>expr</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span> 
<span>[</span><span>pyhelpers</span><span>.</span><span>py</span><span>:</span> <span>27</span><span>]</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>f_globals</code> and <code>f_locals</code> on the frames is still one of my favorite Python features. It lets basically anyone write very good debugging tools without having to do a bunch of magic.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you're an IPython user you can add this to <a href="https://switowski.com/blog/ipython-startup-files">a startup script</a>  over in <code>~/.ipython/profile_default/</code> and make this available in any interactive shell.</p>
<p>For those who value silly things like correctness, performance, and intellectual integrity your journey ends here. This is a nice little helper that you can use in your projects, and there's nothing else for you to see here.</p>
<p>For those who like to live dangerously, I have something to show you.....</p>
<p>



So.</p>
<p>Inside the frame, we have a bunch of information, but one thing that's pretty nice for explorative debugging is the <code>code_context</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>frame</span><span>.</span><span>code_context</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
<span># prints dbg('foo["bar"]')</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we actually have the source line from the <code>dbg</code> call built in!</p>
<p>Let's imagine going back a bit to our "idealized" debug function:</p>


<p>Now, if we ran such a function, the body would receive the <em>value</em> of <code>foo['bar']</code> and not the expression. <em>But</em> thanks to the stack we could theoretically recover the original expression! </p>
<p>This gets a bit tricker if you want to do more clever stuff like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>)))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
   <span>do_stuff</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But let's try to work this out from first principles a bit.</p>
<p>If you have the source code line with the <code>dbg</code> call, how can you recover the expression being debugged?</p>
<p>The first thing is just to find the beginning of the expression. That's pretty easy, just look for <code>dbg(</code></p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
   ^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>So we find the beginning of the expression, right? And since a function call in Python is an open parentheses, some expressions, then a close parentheses, we just have to find the close parentheses and we have the string fragment representing our expression. Let's apply the logic here:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>if dbg(my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre></div>

<p>Great! Our expression is <code>my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "(</code>. Definitely what we wanted. Yep.</p>
<p>This is one of those things where the only way to parse out an expression is to actually parse it out. Simple string matching won't cut it, especially when you start getting inner function calls in the mix.</p>
<p>You could write a simple parser, try and count parens, open quotes, escaping in quotes, all the fun little games. But honestly I want a thing that works, and I don't want to think about it too hard.</p>
<p>I just want to find out where the expression is in this string.</p>
<p>So here's my amazing plan to deal with this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5:'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == 5'</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")) == '</span><span>)</span>
<span># fails</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>ast</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>'my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()")'</span><span>)</span>
<span># doesn't fail =&gt; I have my expression!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I just start with the longest possible string, and slowly shrink it until I find something that looks like an expression. Because the <code>)</code> from the debug call imbalances everything I'm like... 80% sure that this way of finding the expression is correct.</p>
<p>There are some edge cases that make this strategy not work. For example if you do something like:</p>


<p>You have two <code>dbg</code>s on the same line, so it's hard to know <em>which</em> call you're in, because you're only provided the line number. (On some other project I spent a lot of time hand-wringing on this exact problem and could not find a solution, even with tricks like counting executions. I'm fairly convinced this is equivalent to the halting problem somehow)</p>
<p>And to be honest my solution here isn't battle-tested, it just feels right and works with the complicated expressions I've thrown at it. But it was a fun thing to write and now the following works:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>])</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 49] foo["bar"] = 3</span>

<span>if</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>my_func</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>foo</span><span>[</span><span>"bar"</span><span>]</span> <span>+</span> <span>"()"</span><span>))</span> <span>==</span> <span>5</span><span>:</span>
<span># [pyhelpers.py: 52] my_func(3, foo["bar"] + "()") = 5</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Success"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>No more stringifying silliness, no more calls to <code>eval</code>, just a really silly parsing hack that has no real foundation except my gut feeling. </p>
<p>Good enough for me!</p>
<p>the final implemetaion is below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>dbg</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""</span>
<span>    Recover the expression giving the result, and then</span>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>

<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

In the course of a typical Twitter day, which is a week in human time, I agree with Matt, disagree with him, wish I had thought of something he said, regret something he said on his behalf, retweet something he wrote, and make a mental note to talk with him soon. So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it. What he said was so compelling that I’ve decided to break our interview into two issues of the newsletter. Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>While I'm away on my honeymoon, here's my complete talk from PAX Australia 2019, on the rise and fall of legendary shareware publisher Ambrosia Software.</p><p>For Mac gamers in the 90s, the people of Ambrosia Software were rockstars. Heroes. And with brilliant games like Maelstrom, Escape Velocity, Harry the Handsome Executive, Apeiron, and more, plus a company newsletter that spoke directly to the fans, they could do no wrong. In light of Ambrosia's recent closure (finally!), Secret History of Mac Gaming author Richard Moss recounts the studio's high and lowpoints and tells the stories behind its best games.</p><p>Thanks as always to my supporters on Patreon — especially my $10+ backers Vivek Mohan, Simon Moss, Wade Tregaskis, Eric Zocher, and Seth Robinson. And a very big thank you (and warm welcome!) to my five new patrons this month. If you'd like to become a supporter, for as little as $1 a month, head to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lifeandtimesofvideogames" target="_blank">my Patreon page</a> and sign up.</p><p>There'll be no regular episode of The Life &amp; Times of Video Games this week because I'm off on my honeymoon. But to tide you by until I'm back, I thought you might enjoy listening to my talk from PAX Australia 2019 about the lesser-known of the indie game publishing giants from before the time of Braid and Steam and all that other stuff we've had over the past 15 years.</p><p>The talk was called The Rise &amp; Fall of Ambrosia Software, '90s Mac Legends, and you can find accompanying slides at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/paxausambrosiatalk</a> as well as my full script on the accompanying blog post at lifeandtimes.games. So please, enjoy, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks.</p><div><p><em>[note that this won't correspond exactly to the audio, as it was my written script rather than what I actually said. If you're looking at the slides, "[NEXT]" means go to the next slide.]]<br></em><br>Hello everyone. My name is Richard Moss, and today I'm going to talk to you about a company that's pretty near and dear to my heart, not only as someone who grew up playing some of their games — [NEXT] but also as the author of a book called The Secret History of Mac Gaming, which covers their history, along with lots of other games and game developers from the 1980s and 90s Mac gaming scene. [NEXT]</p><p>If you were a Mac gamer in the late 90s, chances are pretty high that you would have had at least one game in your collection that came from Ambrosia Software. [NEXT] They were heroes among the Macintosh faithful, one of only a few companies that made its games exclusive to the Mac. And arguably the best among them in terms of the quality of its output.</p><p>Games like [NEXT] Maelstrom, [NEXT] Escape Velocity, [NEXT] Ferazel's Wand, [NEXT] Apeiron, and [NEXT] Bubble Trouble were hallmarks of quality, even if most of them were essentially just jazzed-up versions of classic 80s games. And they had top-drawer offbeat gaming options, too, with titles like [NEXT] Avara, a kinda abstract-looking arena-style first-person shooter, and [NEXT] Harry the Handsome Executive, where you guide a middle management executive through an office electronics apocalypse while scooting around in a swivel chair.</p><p>For about 15 years or so, from 1993 to around 2008, the Ambrosia Software name was inseparable from quality Macintosh games. But then it faded rapidly into the background, for reasons I'll get to later, and finally the company closed its doors at the end of last year.</p><p>***</p><p>So in recognition of Ambrosia's achievements, which have slipped a bit under the radar outside of the old-school Mac faithful, I wanted to give you a tour through the company's rise and fall. </p><p>There's not enough time to cover everything, but I'll try to get to all the key stuff and you'll hopefully come away with a good sense of a) why Ambrosia Software matters to the history of computer games and b) what made Ambrosia special to the Macintosh flock. </p><p>I've got some interview clips, a bit of gameplay footage, some photos and old documents to help us along the way. I wanted to set up an emulator as well but just ran out of time unfortunately. And hopefully there'll be plenty of time at the end for questions and stories from you in the audience.</p><p>But before we go into rise and fall of Ambrosia, let's do some quick background. First, on Ambrosia founder Andrew Welch. Then second on the Mac gaming scene in the early 90s.</p><p>[NEXT] So, Andrew Welch. His dad owned a marketing company, and it was through that business that young Andrew planted the seed for what would become Ambrosia. When he was something like 12 or 13 years old, he found the company's library of books and documents on typography. He thought it was cool, so he learnt how to design his own typefaces on his Macintosh. Then, starting from age 14 or so, he sold them on America OnLine.</p><p>But most people doing this sold their fonts without any documentation at all, so there was no way to know after the fact who made it, how to pay for it, who to contact for support, and so on. So Andrew taught himself how to code a utility program that could wrap his fonts in a simple document reader thing.</p><p>He enjoyed coding so much that he kept doing it, and made various other utilities for his relatives. Then he went off to college to study photojournalism and in his spare time he created [NEXT] his first game, a Wheel of Fortune clone called Wacky Wheel.</p><p>[NEXT] [show it in action]</p><p>This was kind of par for the course with small Mac games at the time. There were lots of people putting out crappy little games as freeware or shareware, but even the rare good ones weren't really making anything more than pizza and beer money.</p><p>[NEXT] Or literally beer.</p><p>Quick definition of shareware: [NEXT] it's software that you give away, free, but you ask that if someone likes it they pay you a registration fee — which, depending on the exact implementation, might get that person customer support or free updates or maybe just remove the nag screen from the boot-up process.</p><p>[NEXT] This is a pretty typical shareware notice, taken from an early DOS game.</p><p>Over on the PC side, shareware had already taken off. [NEXT] Apogee Software and Epic MegaGames were making a fortune working with independent developers and selling their games in a clever twist of the standard shareware model called The Apogee Model. Instead of giving away the whole thing for free and requesting that people pay if they like it, Apogee and Epic's games were [NEXT] episodic — episode one distributed freely over the internet and BBSs and through mail-order floppy disks, and all subsequent episodes available to order for a set fee.</p><p>I'm actually writing a book about this stuff, so if you're curious to learn more ask me about it later.</p><p>And id Software were just starting to make their name at this point as well. [NEXT] Wolfenstein 3D dropped in 92, then [NEXT] Doom in 93, both published as shareware on PC through Apogee. </p><p>So the time was ripe for shareware to step up and hit the big time on the Mac side, too. The Mac was at the peak of its [NEXT] pre-iMac popularity. College kids across the United States had Macs set up in their dorm rooms, while creative professionals all around the world had taken up the Mac mantle and were keen for more time-wasters to get them through the lulls in their output.</p><p>But there weren't many games coming out — the porting industry, which took PC games and put them on Mac, was still in its infancy after struggling with the [NEXT] peculiarities of adapting games for the Mac's multi-window mouse and menu-driven interface. Truly cross-platform commercial computer games that had concurrent Mac and PC releases were still rare (though there were a few special ones like [NEXT] SimCity 2000), and Mac-first development had gone into a bit of a lull (for a variety of reasons) at the end of the 1980s — from which it had yet to fully recover.</p><p>So there was lots of room for a great new Mac-native game to stand out.</p><p>And, crucially for our story here, someone was wrong on the Internet. I'll let you hear this bit straight from Andrew: [NEXT]</p><p><em>AW: I think it was the summer after maybe my freshman year of college that someone had said — I think it was called the Mac IIci or something like that. It was one of the colour Macs that came out. And someone had said something about the fact that while it was too slow to do decent animation on — and by that point in time I had actually taught myself for Assembly language, as well. So I set out to prove this guy wrong, because it's always fun to try to prove someone on the Internet that they're wrong. <p>*laughs* So, yeah, so that's how I started writing — and I really wasn't sure what I was going to do yet — but I started writing some kind of animation stuff. I grew up going to a lot of the arcades where we played games like Asteroids and Centipede and that type of thing where after school I would get dropped off there and play. So I decided to make an Asteroids-based game.</p></em></p><p>[NEXT]<br>He asked a couple of friends to help him out with the graphics, and got together with a few of his college buddies and a microphone to make a bunch of silly noises and record stuff off the TV for sound effects.</p><p>They pulled liberally from pop culture, drawing tiny clips and references (without permission) from all over the place, kind of like the wall of sound that early hip-hop and remix culture had.[NEXT]</p><p>He called the game Maelstrom and put it online as shareware, published under the name Ambrosia Software — a name he pulled from Greek mythology. You could play it and share it freely, but it'd nag you to send in a cheque to register every time you booted the game. And a lot of people did. [NEXT]</p><p><em>everyday we would go to the mailbox and there'd be letters from all over the world. I just had a blast. I thought it was really really cool that I could do something just sitting in my room in upstate New York, which was where I was at the time. And I got these contacts from all over the world. I thought that was really really cool, and it was at a time where people were just starting to get connected online.<p>Like now it's no big deal — you can go on …</p></em></p></div></div>

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption.

When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
