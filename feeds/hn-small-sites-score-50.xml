<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://carlschwan.eu/assets/img/heading_hugo.png" alt="Screenshot KDE.org"></p>

<p><a href="https://kde.org/">KDE.org</a> now uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Hugo is a fast and modern static site
generator written in Go. It provides a few improvements over the old system that was
using plain PHP. A large part of the work was done by Anuj during GSoC 2020. This
was a massive work, converting the repository storing more than 20 years of KDE
history.</p>

<p>The website is now generated once and no longer uses PHP to generate itself at runtime.
This improves the loading speed of the website, but the speed boost is not significant,
since the PHP code used before was quite small and KDE’s servers are powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest improvement is in terms of features. We are now working with markdown
files instead of raw HTML files, this makes the life of the promo team much easier.</p>

<p>The internationalization of the website now creates a unique URL per language, this
should allow Google to link to the version of the website using the correct language.
A <a href="https://kde.org/fr/">French</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/uk/">Ukrainian</a>,
<a href="https://kde.org/ca/">Catalan</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/nl/">Dutch</a>, and a few more languages
are already available. There is also a proper language selector! We also don’t need
to manually tag each string for translations.</p>

<p>There is also now an <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/index.xml">RSS feed</a> with all the
latest announcements. Another big improvement is that the announcements list is
autogenerated and no longer modified by hand and with the help of the release scripts.</p>

<p>Another nice change for website developers is that now the SCSS code for the individual
pages is located in the kde-org repository itself instead of another repository.
Overall the developer experience is much better, there is no need to set up an apache
server and to the PHP configs to include the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/websites/capacity">capacity framework</a>, just to get the
website running locally. Now you only need to download the Hugo binary from their
release page and run it on the repo.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-and-gettext">Hugo and Gettext</h2>

<p>The internationalization of KDE.org was quite a challenge. When working on a multilingual
website with Hugo, Hugo expects a markdown document per language for each translated
page.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plasma-desktop.md
plasma-desktop.es.md
plasma-desktop.fr.md
plasma-desktop.uk.md
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that traditional translations workflow rely on a string-based approach,
where a document is split in paragraphs and translated individually. So I couldn’t
just put each file markdown file as big blobs in the po files. To solve this problem,
I created a python script splitting the markdown files in paragraphs, simplifying
the markdown syntax (removing leading <code>#</code> and <code>+</code> for heading and list item). This
script also handles Hugo shortcodes transforming:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; img caption="My figure caption" alt="My accessible description" src="..." &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My figure caption</li>
  <li>My accessible description</li>
</ul>

<p>The script can obliviously put the individual strings back in place. The scripts also
handle the menu translation, and the translations of the strings in the footers.
For now, the script is just a file in the kde-org repository, but I would like to
transform it to a standalone library so that other gettext and Hugo users can
translate their website.</p>

<p>Using Hugo API, the language selector was trivial to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
&lt;ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"&gt;
  {{ if .IsTranslated }}
    &lt;li class="nav-item dropdown" aria-describedby="language-picker-description"&gt;
      &lt;p class="sr-only" id="language-picker-description"&gt;{{ i18n "Select-your-language" }}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/Language-Icons/icon20x24px-exported-transparent.png" alt="" /&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;{{ i18n "translations" }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="dropdown-menu dropdonw-trans" role="listbox"&gt;
        &lt;a class="dropdown-item" aria-selected="true" hreflang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Site.Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ range .Translations }}
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" hreflang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ end }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a bit verbose because this selector is also fully accessible for screen readers.</p>

<p>There are a few more tricks employed in kde.org to improve the internationalization, for
example when a page doesn’t exist in a language, there is an Apache rule redirecting it
to the English version. Another nice trick is that there is a special Hugo shortcode
called <code>i18n_var</code> and used to parametrize the strings. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; i18n_var "Today KDE releases a bugfix update to KDE Plasma 5, versioned %[1]s" "5.20.2" &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the extractor is clever and only extract the part that needs to be translated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When we started work on the recently released feature <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/review-changes">Review Changes</a>, we needed a way to keep a significant part of the edit history of a document in the browser memory to be able to respond quickly to different user interface states. As the user picked various document versions to compare we wanted to be able to quickly reconstruct a specific section of the history of a document. </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="false"></div></div><figcaption>Review Changes for Sanity Studio. Powered by Mendoza.</figcaption></figure><p>For text diffs, we use the <a href="https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch">diff-match-patch format</a>, and we just assumed someone would have implemented a similarly efficient and compact diff format for JSON documents, but no such luck. If we wanted a general JSON diff format that was super compact and fast to apply, we would have to invent it ourselves. And thus, Mendoza, the totally non-human readable diff format for structured JSON documents, was born.</p><p>Mendoza is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight JSON format</li><li>A flexible format that can accommodate more advanced encodings in the future</li><li>As a Go library for encoding and decoding</li><li>A JavaScript library for decoding</li><li>Efficient handling of the renaming of fields</li><li>Efficient handling of reordering of arrays</li><li>Not designed to be human-readable</li></ul><p>Mendoza differs (hah!) from normal diffs as they are:</p><ul><li>Made for humans to read and understand and based on simple operations (like keep, insert, and delete text)</li><li>Possible to apply even if the source has changed a bit by including some of the contexts around every part that has changed</li><li>Designed for text, and not structured documents</li></ul><p>Now, this is great when you are collaborating with humans on code development and use something like git to track your changes. What it isnâ€™t great for, however, is expressing differences between structured documents (such as JSON) in a compact manner that can be efficiently transferred over the network and parsed in JavaScript inside of browsers.</p><div data-block-key="27e85758c59a"><h2><a id="most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"></a><a href="#most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Most diffs aren't meant for machines</h2></div><p>Most diff formats are made to be human-readable.

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was a power user of <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for many years, so I had mixed
feelings recently about <a href="https://archive.is/zpx2r">their decision</a> to change
their pricing model. Under IFTTT's new pricing, you can only have 3 “custom”
actions created/enabled at any time – which is quite a downgrade from the
current unlimited free plan. On the one hand, I'm glad to see IFTTT take
necessary steps to ensure it has long-term financial stability, but on the other
hand, I don't personally get enough value from their service anymore to justify
a recurring cost. (The plan will likely be
$4/month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but if you sign up before a deadline, you
can lock in a price as low as $2/month)</p>
<p>IFTTT was an awesome and uniquely easy-to-use service when it first came out,
but now there are better options for personal automation for people like me, who
like to tinker with this sort of thing. Systems like
<a href="https://nodered.org/">node-red</a> and iOS shortcuts can be self hosted or run on
device, and they provide more sophisticated logic for workflows than IFTTT.</p>
<p>I stayed on IFTTT this long mostly due to inertia, and it's fantastically long
list of supported services. If I needed to throw together a quick
spreadsheet-recording automation, or cron-like trigger, IFTTT was a great
starting place. However, it does have limitations. Until now (though it seems
like this might change with their premium offering), IFTTT basically only did
what its name implied: “if this, then that”. No “if X then Y else Z”, no “if X
and Z then Y”, etc. Often times, you don't need any complicated logic or
filtering, but it was frustrating that there wasn't the option for more advanced
automation. Ultimately, IFTTT had a great “on-ramp”, but once you were on board
with their system, you realize how shallow it is. Excellent breadth, mediocre
depth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the past couple years IFTTT's UI has leaned heavily into the
“applet” metaphor, with these big goofy toggle switches to enable/disable
automations. The site also transitioned towards a focus on community- (or, more
often corporate-) created automations, at the expense of the experience for
creating your own applets. Like seriously, why is 30% of the UI for an applet
<em>details page</em> (!) taken up by the connection status toggle?</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>The settings page, too, is woefully information sparse. As a user, this makes me
feel that desktop-usability was not high on IFTTT's design priorities. You have
to scroll the page to begin to start to see what the automation is doing:</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, the UI got to the point where it felt like using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo">Duplos</a> or something. It didn't have
to be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable
interfaces, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>.</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png">
        
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>So, I decided to migrate away, since the move to premium was already going to
substantially limit what I could do with IFTTT. In going through my catalog of
IFTTT “applets”, I identified 3 main patterns of automations that I used IFTTT
for: (1) triggering an action to happen at a specific time, (2) triggering an
action to happen in response to a location change (i.e. geofencing), or (3)
triggering an action to happen in response to an event in a web service.</p>
<p>Of these 3 buckets, iOS shortcuts readily handles the first 2: as of iOS 14,
Shortcuts can be triggered in the background at a specific time of day, or in
response to entering/leaving a geofence. Shortcuts also has a much more
sophisticated integration with iOS than any of IFTTT's apps, so more exciting
mobile automation becomes possible – for example, setting my phone to Low Power
Mode once the battery drops below a certain threshold. Of course, you are
restricted to apps/services that support Shortcuts, and the number of supported
services is considerably smaller than IFTTT.</p>
<p>Node-red handles buckets 1 and 3: it has good support for time-based actions,
and can receive webhooks to respond to events from external services. It also
has a great plugin ecosystem, so it's support begins to rival IFTTT's impressive
selection of supported services. Additionally, node-red has many “escape
hatches” that IFTTT does not: you can use it to make raw HTTP requests and write
your own plugins/logic in Javascript, allowing for much more complex automation.</p>
<p>Neither node-red nor iOS shortcuts are as easy to use as IFTTT for putting
together a simple automation, which is a shame. However, between them (and other
alternative automation frameworks that I've trialed, like <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/huginn/huginn">huginn</a>), I've more than covered my
personal automation needs.</p>
<p>And so, goodbye IFTTT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm not put off by them charging for their service; I
think charging for software is a good thing! It's just that this was the nudge I
needed to move my automations to infrastructure that I have more control over,
which has other benefits outside the scope of this article. I'm thankful that a
service like IFTTT continues to exist; I still think it's a fantastic tool to
“on-ramp” less technical folks into automation and no-code tools.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The other day, I was watching Bryan Cantrill’s 2018 talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">Rust, and Other Interesting Things</a>, and he made an offhanded comment while discussing values of different programming languages and communities. He said, “If you get the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">awk programming language manual</a>…you’ll read it in about two hours and then you’re done. That’s it. You know all of awk.”</p>

<p>Only two hours to learn an entire language?! …. Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I had previously used snippets of awk here and there. Most of them were given to me by Stack Overflow answers when googling for niche data file manipulations. But, I did not know enough to successfully write an awk program from scratch. I definitely did not have a real grasp on the language nor its power. And, a couple of hours sounded like a relatively small time investment to learn what Bryan Cantrill said was a language he used three times a day.</p>

<p>It turns out it takes more than two hours to learn awk, and I am by no means an expert… yet (growth mindset!). But, I now know enough to write a little about the essentials. Here goes!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-awk-useful-for">What is awk useful for?</h3>

<p>Awk is useful for data file manipulation. Already, having used it for a few days only, I wish I had invested time in learning it earlier. My usual workflow when encountering a data file is to import it into Google Sheets and use their builtin functions. If those weren’t enough, I would write little code snippets to somewhat awk..wardly get the information I want. Awk is way more powerful than what I was doing before. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="running-awk-programs">Running awk programs</h3>

<p>If we’re going to learn awk, we need to know how to run an awk program. The syntax to run an awk program in a shell is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'awk_program_contents'</span> data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can also write a longer awk program to run instead of writing the awk code inline. We could write a file with awk codeand then pass inline to awk with <code>-f &lt;awk-program-filename&gt;</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-f</span> awk-program.awk data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="awk-program-contents">awk program contents</h3>

<p>Well, what is an awk program? We know it is best used for simple data reformatting or manipulation. The way it does this is by performing different actions on different patterns within a data file. The basic syntax of an awk program depends on these pattern and actions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can give as many <code>pattern { action }</code> pairs as we want. Each pair will be executed independently of the others. This means if a line matches more than one pattern, it will have more than one corresponding action. In the example above we use newlines to separate distinct pairs. Similar to bash, we can also use <code>;</code> to separate commands and put everything on one line: <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action }</code></p>

<h3 id="awk-with-data-files">awk with data files</h3>

<p>But, it turns out awk is much more useful (and fun!) with a data file. The UN has a few <a href="https://data.un.org/">publicly available datasets</a>. I picked <a href="https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_309_201906_Education.csv">this one</a> on education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to delve into first.</p>

<p>Let’s start by using awk to get a sense of what the data looks like.  <code>NR</code> is a predefined variable which records the number of rows read in a file so far. We can use it to look at the first few lines of a program. In this case, our pattern will be <code>NR &lt;= 5</code>, and by not including an action, the implied action will be <code>print</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>,,,,,
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Students enrolled <span>in </span>primary education <span>(</span>thousands<span>)</span>,<span>"678,991.6070"</span>,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollement ratio - Primary <span>(</span>male<span>)</span>,104.9360,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollment ratio - Primary <span>(</span>female<span>)</span>,99.9214,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Okay, so looks like this is giving us a bit of information about our file. Notably:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are two header rows: a title row, and a row telling us what the fields are</li>
  <li>The file is comma separated</li>
  <li>… except there are sometimes commas within double quoted strings: <code>"Total, all countries or areas"</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s address these one by one!</p>



<p>We can ignore the first two header rows by using our nifty <code>NR</code> moving forward. We can pattern match that <code>NR &gt; 2</code>. Note: awk is 1-indexed.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &gt; 2'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="field-separators">Field Separators</h3>

<p>awk’s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Default-Field-Splitting">default field separator</a> is a space. We can actually see this by printing the first field. To access the value of a field, we use <code>$&lt;field_index&gt;</code>. So <code>$1</code> is the first field, <code>$2</code> the second, and so on. <code>$0</code> refers to the entire row.</p>

<p>If we try this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,"</span>Total,
1,<span>"Total,
1,"</span>Total,
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>we can confirm that we’re splitting on spaces. awk has the option to specify a different field separator with the <code>-F 'separator'</code> flag:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07
Region/Country/Area
1
1
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! But…. we had commas embedded within strings with double quotes. Sure enough, if we print the second field (<code>$2</code>), we see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary

"</span>Total
<span>"Total
"</span>Total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmmm. What we want here is to split fields by <em>content</em>. Which awk does not have, but gawk (GNU awk) does: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Splitting-By-Content">FPAT</a>! From the gawk manual: “All properly written awk programs should work with gawk. So most of the time, we don’t distinguish between gawk and other awk implementations.”</p>

<p>Sounds like we can use gawk here instead then. Let’s try pattern matching. I’m not going to go into regex here, but the pattern we want, defined by <code>"[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\""</code> is anything that either starts with a non-comma character, or starts with a double quote, contains only non-quote characters, and ends with a double quote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gawk <span>'BEGIN { FPAT = "[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\"" } NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>

<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I snuck a <code>BEGIN</code> in there without explaining it. Let’s go on a brief tangent…</p>

<h3 id="begin--tangent-">BEGIN { tangent }</h3>

<p>Beyond the pattern and actions, awk also has a concept of <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> blocks. The <code>BEGIN</code> is executed before any of the data is processed. It can be useful for declaring variables or printing text to appear at the beginning. Analogously, the <code>END</code> is executed after the data is processed. It can be useful for performing manipulations on aggregates of the data, like averaging a sum.</p>

<p>This means if we wanted to write a little “Hello, awk!” program, we could do it without even needing a data file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'BEGIN { print "Hello, awk!" }'</span>
Hello, <span>awk</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="end--tangent-">END { tangent }</h3>

<p>…back to our example. In our case, we used a <code>BEGIN</code> block to declare the <code>FPAT</code> <em>before</em> reading our data file.</p>

<p>But, we’ve only looked at the first 5 lines. For all we know, the rest of the file could look completely different. Let’s use <code>NR</code> again to see some more of the file. First, let’s figure out how long the file is. We can use the <code>END</code> block here. After we’ve parsed the whole file, we can see what the value of <code>NR</code> is, and that’ll tell us how many lines it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'END { print NR }'</span> education.csv
8630
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so maybe if we print every 500 lines, we’ll get a sense of what data we’re looking at. We can set our pattern to be only if <code>NR</code> is a multiple of <code>500</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR % 500 == 0'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and I’m going to leave this blog post on a real cliff hanger. Mostly because it already feels too long! There’s <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/awk-part-2">a second post</a> about awk actually looking at the data and manipulating it to figure out which countries have stark differences in number of males and females that they educate.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-or-tlskimmed-far-enough-to-get-here-please-give-me-the-shorter-version">TL;DR or TL;Skimmed far enough to get here, please give me the shorter version:</h3>
<p>To rehash what we’ve learned about awk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>awk is run using <code>awk 'awk_program' data-file</code></li>
  <li>awk programs have the form <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action };</code></li>
  <li><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are executed before reading data files</li>
  <li><code>END</code> blocks are executed after reading data files</li>
  <li><code>NR</code> is a variable that tells us the number of rows read</li>
  <li><code>-F '&lt;separator&gt;'</code> is how we can define a field separator for a file</li>
  <li>Space is the default field separator</li>
  <li><code>FPAT="..."</code> is a way to use regex to define a pattern for each field</li>
  <li><code>FPAT</code> is only defined in gawk</li>
</ul>

October 30, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_learning_curve">Learning Curve</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>full_name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>
<p>Natural way to model that in Kotlin is by adding <code>interface Definition</code> and <code>interface Reference</code>.
The problem is, some things are …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <strong>Vega-Lite</strong> is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.
</p>

<p><span>
  <span>
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to <strong>properties of graphical marks</strong> (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler <strong>automatically produces visualization components</strong> including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of <strong>carefully designed rules</strong>.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both <strong>data transformations</strong> (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and <strong>visual transformations</strong> (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be <strong>composed</strong> into layered and multi-view displays, and made <strong>interactive with selections</strong>.

<p>Compared to <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega">Vega</a>, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the <em>primary</em> visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.</p>
