</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

</ul>
<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>
<li>More examples: <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World">The Biggest Shell Programs in the
World</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>
<p>Threads:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drp7jv6/">Perl vs Shell</a> (reddit)</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16228941">Are you reinventing Perl?</a> (Hacker News)</li>
</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>

<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>On account of these partnerships and the licensing involved, Plex Arcade will be a separate subscription for <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you have a Plex Pass (and <span data-pp-price-feature="arcade"></span> per month if you haven’t made the leap to Plex Pass yet). Don’t know if you’ll like it? <a href="https://www.plex.tv/arcade/checkout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Try it free for 7 days</strong></a> (that’s a whole week among friends), no strings attached, and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>Be fruitful</h3>
<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_19d"><div><p>As our application scales to multiple users, we need to start thinking about scaling our servers and applications with it. Load balancing is the activity of effectively distributing traffic load across multiple servers.</p><p>This is how we achieve highly available applications that help us achieve scaling effectively.</p><h2>What is load-balancing?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Since nobody can afford a web server overload, we scale out our backend servers to multiple machines. The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page
            </p>
            <p><b>21M</b> resource URLs requested
            </p>
            <p><b>383K</b> errors logged

        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.003%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.0 (0.22%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 1.1 (40.7%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 2 (59%)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-correlation.png" alt="Correlations with dominteractive">
            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.
        </p>

        
        <p id="full-di-expand"><a onclick="expandDi()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for metrics, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>main_doc_is_http2_or_greater (-477.53)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

<h4>The GPD P2 Max is a hyper-powered cross between a palm pilot and an ultrabook - it's a cyberdeck by any other name...</h4>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>

<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>

<img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/ghetto_cyberdeck.png" alt="The most ghetto cyberdeck... IN THE WORLD!">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On 8 January 2021 at 14:05 CET the synchronous area of Continental Europe was separated into two parts due to outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time. ENTSO-E has published the first information on the event already on 8 January 2021, followed by an update with geographical view and time sequence on 15 January 2021. Since then, ENTSO-E has analysed a large portion of relevant data aiming to reconstruct the event in detail.</p><p>This second update presents the key findings of detailed analyses, which have a preliminary character subject to new facts, which will emerge in the still ongoing investigation.</p><p>The analysed sequence of events concludes that the initial event was the tripping of a 400 kV busbar coupler in the substation Ernestinovo (Croatia) by overcurrent protection at 14:04:25.9. This resulted in a decoupling of the two busbars in the Ernestinovo substation, which in turn separated North-West and south-east electric power flows in this substation. As shown in Figure 1 below, North-West bound lines which remained connected to one busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Zerjavinec (Croatia) and Pecs (Hungary), while South-East bound lines which remained connected to another busbar, connect Ernestinovo to Ugljevik (Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Sremska Mitrovica (Serbia).</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ca35232da145a366158c9b4df33d787e40d621c9/129ad/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-2.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 1 - Decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The separation of flows in the Ernestinovo substation, lead to the shifting of electric power flows to neighbouring lines which were subsequently overloaded. At 14:04:48.9, the line Subotica – Novi Sad (Serbia) tripped due to overcurrent protection. This was followed by the further tripping of lines due to distance protection, as shown in Figure 2, below, leading eventually to the system separation into two parts at 14:05:08.6.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f409f977d1a2b6c2df1e49861416d463445808b0/06d80/assets/graphics/uploads/system-separation-figure-3.png" alt="" title="Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo"></p><p><em>Figure 2 - Tripping of additional transmission network elements after the decoupling of two busbars in Ernestinovo</em></p><p>The route where the two parts of the Continental Europe Synchronous Area were separated is shown in Figure 3 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/de60ebc1aaeb673286f78d35b23db319639b40f6/35e86/assets/graphics/uploads/thrid.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021"></p><p><em>Figure 3 – Separation of Continental Europe Synchronous Area on 8 January 2021</em></p><p>The system separation resulted in a deficit of power (approx. -6.3 GW) in the North-West Area and a surplus of power (approx. +6.3 GW) in the South-East Area, resulting in turn in a frequency decrease in the North-West Area and a frequency increase in the South-East Area.</p><p>At approximately 14:05 CET, the frequency in the North-West Area initially decreased to a value of 49.74 Hz within a period of around 15 seconds before quickly reaching a steady state value of approximately 49.84 Hz. At the same time, the frequency in the South-East Area initially increased up to 50.6 Hz before settling at a steady state frequency between 50.2 Hz and 50.3 Hz as illustrated in Figure 4 below:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/af53041f1f9915046a980de1662f685154376b5c/670b8/assets/graphics/uploads/forth.png" alt="" title="Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation"></p><p><em>Figure 4 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 right after the disturbance and during resynchronisation</em></p><p>Due to the low frequency in the North-West Area, contracted interruptible services in France and Italy (in total around 1.7 GW) were disconnected in order to reduce the frequency deviation. These services are provided by large customers who are contracted by the respective Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to be disconnected if frequency drops under a certain threshold. In addition, 420 MW and 60 MW of supportive power were automatically activated from the Nordic and Great Britain synchronous areas respectively. These countermeasures ensured that already at 14:09 CET the frequency deviation from the nominal value of 50 Hz was reduced to around 0.1 Hz in the North-West area (Figure 4).</p><p>In order to reduce the high frequency in the South-East Area, automatic and manual countermeasures were activated, including the reduction of generation output (Eg. automatic disconnection of a 975 MW generator in Turkey at 14:04:57). As a consequence, the frequency in the South-East Area returned to 50.2 Hz at 14:29 CET and remained within control limits (49.8 and 50.2 Hz) until the resynchronisation of the two separated areas took place at 15:07:31.6 CET.</p><p>Between 14:30 CET and 15:06 CET the frequency in the South-East area was fluctuating between 49.9 Hz and 50.2 Hz due to the rather small size of the South-East Area where also several production units were disconnected (Figure 5). During this period, the frequency in the North-West Area fluctuated far less and remained close to the nominal value, due to the rather large size of the North-West Area. This frequency behaviour is a subject of further detailed investigation.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83de537eb517d8e18789e4116bb3561294bf39c8/a45a4/assets/graphics/uploads/graph_nw_se_03_1400h-1515h.jpg" alt="" title="Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration "></p><p><em>Figure 5 - Frequency in Continental Europe during the event on 8 January 2021 for the complete duration</em></p><p>The automatic response and the coordinated actions taken by the TSOs in Continental Europe ensured that the situation was quickly restored close to normal operation. The contracted interruptible services in Italy and in France were reconnected at 14:47 CET and 14:48 CET respectively prior to the resynchronisation of the North-West and South-East areas at 15:08 CET.</p><p>ENTSO-E continues to keep the European Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group, composed of representatives of Member States, informed and updated with detailed results of the preliminary technical analyses.</p><p>Based on the preliminary technical analyses presented above, a formal investigation following the legal framework under the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017 (System Operation Guideline) will be established, whereby National Regulatory Authorities and ACER are invited to join with TSOs in an Expert Investigation Panel.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the mentioned Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 of 2 August 2017, ENTSO-E will present the results of the investigation to the Electricity Coordination Group and will subsequently publish a report once the analysis is completed.</p><hr><p><strong>Note:</strong> All figures and details about the sequence of the events are still subject to final investigation and possible changes.</p><p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p><p>What is a system separation?</p><p>The transmission grids of the countries of Continental Europe are electrically tied together to operate synchronously at the frequency of approximately 50 Hz. An event on 8 January 2021 caused the Continental Europe synchronous area to separate into two areas, with an area in the South-East of Europe being temporarily operating in separation from the rest of Continental Europe.</p><p>Is this the first time such an event happens in Continental Europe?</p><p>The Continental Europe synchronous area is one of the largest interconnected synchronous electricity systems in the world in terms of its size and number of supplied customers. Such a kind of event can happen in any electric power system. System resilience and preparedness of system operators in charge have a decisive impact on the consequences of such events. A separation of the synchronous area with a much larger disturbance and impacts on customers took place in Continental Europe on the 4 November 2006. This event was extensively analysed and led to a number of substantial developments, like the European Awareness System (EAS) which is a platform allowing TSOs to exchange operational information in real time, enabling them to react immediately in case of unusual system condition. The TSOs are therefore well prepared in order to coordinate and manage such events and limit the consequences. This preparedness and a permanent observation of the system frequency allowed to resynchronize the two separated areas in a very short period of time.</p><p>How are countermeasures coordinated in Continental Europe in case of frequency deviations?</p><p>In Continental Europe, procedures are in place to avoid system disturbances and especially large frequency deviations with the risk of uncoordinated disconnection of customers or generation. The TSOs Amprion (Germany) and Swissgrid (Switzerland) are responsible for these procedures in their role as synchronous area monitor (SAM) in Continental Europe. The SAM continuously monitors the system frequency. In case of large frequency deviations, they inform all TSOs via the European Awareness System (EAS) and launch an extraordinary procedure for frequency deviations to coordinate countermeasures in a fast and effective manner in order to stabilize the system. One step of this procedure is a telephone conference by Amprion, Swissgrid, RTE (France), Terna (Italy) and REE (Spain). This teleconference took place at 14:09 CET on 8 January 2021. In the telephone conference, the situation was evaluated, the TSOs informed about countermeasures which were already activated. The TSOs of the North-West and South-East Area also coordinated the actions for reconnection in order to reach one synchronous area in Continental Europe again.</p><p>Were end customers disconnected? Were there any other consequences?</p><p>Customers in the order of 70 MW in the North-East Area and in the order of 163 MW in the South-East Area were disconnected. Due to the high resilience of the interconnected network and the rapid response of European TSOs, the security of operation and electricity supply was not endangered further. An important contribution to stabilizing the system was delivered by the previously contracted interruptible services, which were activated in France and Italy. Such contracts which have been agreed with customers allow the TSO to temporarily and automatically reduce the electrical consumption depending on the situation with the electric power system in real-time.</p><p>What is an electrical busbar?</p><p>A busbar is an electrical junction in a substation, which connects overhead lines, cables and transformers through electrical switches. Usually, there are several busbars in a substation, which can be connected by a busbar coupler. Are there special devices protecting the equipment in a substation? Various devices protect the equipment in a substation. One of them is an overcurrent protection relay, disconnecting automatically the equipment (Eg. overhead line or cable) if the electrical …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

(Rafael Henrique / Getty Images)"></a><figcaption>(Rafael Henrique / Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Today’s newsletter is a special edition. A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/michael_burry.jpg" alt="Michael Burry"></p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

          <p>A few months ago I experimented with DigitalOcean spaces as my backup solution that could <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">replace Dropbox eventually</a>. That solution worked quite nicely, and I was amazed how smashing together a couple of existing solutions would work this fine.</p>
<p>I have been running that solution in the background for a couple of months now and kind of forgot about it. But recent developments around deplatforming and having us people hostages of technology and big companies speed up my goals to become less dependent on <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/tech/google-antitrust-lawsuit/index.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048680/dropbox-takes-a-peek-at-files.html">Dropbox</a> etc and take back some control.</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theory nut, but to be honest, what these companies are doing lately is out of control. It is a matter of principle at this point. I have almost completely degoogled my life all the way from ditching Gmail, YouTube and most of the services surrounding Google. And I must tell you, I feel so good. I haven't felt this way for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Anyways. Let's get to the meat of things.</strong></p>
<p>Before you continue you should read my post about <a href="https://mitjafelicijan.com/digitalocean-spaces-to-sync-between-computers.html">syncing to Dropbox</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to note, I am using Linux on my machine with Gnome desktop environment. This should work on MacOS too. To use this on Windows I suggest using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Subsystem for Linux</a> or <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h2>
<p>I liked structure from Dropbox. One folder where everything is located and synced. So, that's why adopted this also for my sync setup.</p>
<pre><code>~/Vault
   ↳ backup
   ↳ bin
   ↳ documents
   ↳ projects
</code></pre>
<p>All of my code is located in <code>~/Vault/projects</code> folder. And most of the projects are Git repositories. I do not use this sync method for backup per see but in case I reinstall my machine I can easily recreate all the important folder structure with one quick command. No external drives needed that can fail etc.</p>
<h2 id="sync-script">Sync script</h2>
<p>My sync script is located in <code>~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &lt; tilix.dconf
# 0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh

cd ~/Vault/backup/dotfiles

MACHINE=$(whoami)@$(hostname)
mkdir -p $MACHINE
cd $MACHINE

cp ~/.config/VSCodium/User/settings.json settings.json
cp ~/.s3cfg s3cfg
cp ~/.bash_extended bash_extended
cp ~/.ssh ssh -rf

codium --list-extensions &gt; vscode-extension.txt
dconf dump /com/gexperts/Tilix/ &gt; tilix.dconf

cd ~/Vault
s3cmd sync --delete-removed --exclude 'node_modules/*' --exclude '.git/*' --exclude '.venv/*' ./ s3://bucket-name/backup/

echo `date +"%D %T"` &gt;&gt; ~/.vault.log

notify-send \
	-u normal \
	-i /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/96x96/status/security-medium-symbolic.symbolic.png \
	"Vault sync succeded at `date +"%D %T"`"
</code></pre>
<p>This script also backups some of the dotfiles I use and sends notification to Gnome notification center. It is a straightforward solution. Nothing special going on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One obvious benefit of this is that I can omit syncing Node's <code>node_modules</code> or Python's <code>.venv</code> and <code>.git</code> folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use this script in a combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.</p>
<pre><code>0 2 * * * sh ~/Vault/bin/vault-backup.sh
</code></pre>
<p>When you start syncing your local stuff with a remote server you can review your items on DigitalOcean.</p>
<p><img src="https://mitjafelicijan.com/assets/dropbox-sync/dropbox-spaces.png" alt="Dropbox Spaces"></p>
<p>I have been using this script now for quite some time, and it's working flawlessly. I also uninstalled Dropbox and stopped using it completely.</p>
<p>All I need to do is write a Bash script that does the reverse and downloads from remote server to local folder. This could be another post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>UPDATE: Since this blew up 1. I wrote this mostly in response <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon">this article in Bloomberg</a>. 2. If you want to follow me on Twitter for more hot takes on internet culture and marketing stuff you can do that here: <a href="https://twitter.com/JeromySonne">@jeromysonne</a></p>



<p>I want to preface all of this by saying I am not an investing expert. I currently hold no publicly traded companies’ stock. (Though I might I haven’t logged into Robinhood in a while). What I am pretty good at though is internet culture and understanding communities through that lens. I also don’t agree with the Wallstreetbets culture. I’m just trying to explain it.</p>



<p>The recent dramatic fall and meteoric rise of Gamestop via the short squeeze that happened has a lot of technical reasons that people a lot better at finance can explain. What keeps coming up though is Wallstreetbets and their hand in taking a stock that seemed doomed to failure and rocketing it to new heights. I’m seeing a lot of well-meaning takes on their role that generally miss the “why” of the community and what it does / how it exists. After reading a well-written article in Bloomberg (that ultimately misses the point on WSB). I thought I would take a moment to give some insights.</p>



<p>References to tendies, autism, gay bears, and a bunch of other things don’t really make a lot of sense on the surface (and some make even less sense once you dive in). The culture of Wallstreetbets is an interesting one, to say the least, that has a lot of its language and customs rooted in 4chan. As 4chan users have grown up, migrated to other corners of the internet, and spread their language it’s continued on and evolved in different spaces. You saw a lot of this with the_donald on Reddit a few years ago before it was banned and a lot of similar overlap in language between what the community was and what WSB is now. (Twitter is so late to the party compared to Reddit).</p>



<p>The basic surface-level story of WSB is this. It’s a bunch of autistic losers that live in their mom’s basement who are gambling what little money they have to try and become rich to live lifestyles of hedonism. Since they are basement dwellers their obvious food of choice is chicken tenders aka tendies that they trade in their GBPs (Good boy points) to their mom so they can get more. In this world, they earn good boy points by doing well at stocks.</p>



<p>On the surface, it seems really weird but it’s mostly a type of gallows humor that permeates a lot of especially young millennials and zennial men. That nothing really means anything, that no one cares about them (or in some cases actively hate them), and so they reject buying in on the society they feel actively scorns them. I’ll resist the urge to add my personal opinions or quote Fight Club here, but I’m mostly saying all this to get you in their head.</p>



<p>As someone that deals with some (in the grand scheme of things minor) mental health issues around panic attacks and anxiety attacks the “Fuck it if nothing means anything I may as well do what I want” attitude on a self-destructive and nihilistic level makes sense to me. It’s not logical but it makes sense. If nothing means anything you may as well do what you want and try and have some fun before the existential crisis of death takes us all. To do that though you need cash, and most of us are slammed with student debt, increased COL, and stagnant wages as compared to our parents’ generation. All the “boomer” advice we’re given doesn’t really make sense especially when it comes to the dreaded value investing that we’re told to do when it comes to stocks especially in light of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>



<p>See back in the day if you played the rules, worked the job, saved the money you could mostly live a pretty good life. The system was there and it had your back you just had to play by the rules. At some point that changed. Understanding that fundamentally you can do “everything right” and be totally fucked anyways, never able to achieve your dreams regardless of what you do or don’t do is a shitty feeling. Along comes WSB.</p>



<p>Suddenly, there’s a chance. Not a big one, but a chance to get out of your situation and live the life you want. You can do everything right and never be able to retire anyway, OR you can take super speculative positions in the stock market by making giant bets on risky options that, if you happen to be right, could make you rich. You’ve broken the cycle and you can live the life you want. Worst case? You’re right back where you started.</p>



<p>““<strong>If you owe</strong>&nbsp;your bank a hundred pounds,&nbsp;<strong>you have a problem</strong>. But&nbsp;<strong>if you owe</strong>&nbsp;a million,&nbsp;<strong>it</strong>&nbsp;has.” – Big Daddy Keyne$</p>



<p>I think there are really 2 things you need to understand about WSB (And really this piece of internet culture in general). It’s 50% depression and 50% a Molotov cocktail. You either win and get out or you lose AND you’re sticking it to the man at the same time. Even if I go super long, ratchet up the leverage, and take a big bet and lose guess what?</p>



<p>Nothing.</p>



<p>Seriously nothing. Most of these people are in hopeless debt with no clear path out anyway. They declare bankruptcy and move on. They took the bet, rode the adrenaline rush, and they lost. The silver lining? The elites that hate them are stuck paying the bill. It’s really a win-win situation. The memes, the culture, all of it really stems from this attitude.</p>



<p>I think it’s honestly fascinating that people are finally starting to notice this sub-culture once it’s begun affecting the mainstream financial system. Maybe now that it’s hitting these folks where they live, hurting the only thing they care about, they’ll start thinking about why these people are acting out. Before anyone accuses me of being a socialist I have a startup that sells <a href="https://decibelads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radio ads called Decibel</a>. I’m a died in the wool capitalist and I can plainly see these issues. That maybe if they felt they had more of a stake in the future, that wealth inequality wasn’t so bad, that they’ll never afford a home, etc. they wouldn’t feel the need to act out. That if they weren’t in such an unwinnable situation they wouldn’t feel the need to throw Molotov cocktails through the front window of the country and the global financial system.</p>



<p>I doubt it, but one can hope.</p>



<p>Until then this is going to get worse, not better.</p>

<p>Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Space Port Sation, Florida — SpaceX made history again by sending a record number of 143 satellites on a single mission to the lower Earth orbit yesterday. The record was previously held by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with 103 satellites on a single launch.</p>



<p>Among these were 10 SpaceX Starlink satellites that are deployed to the Polar Orbit (see animation below for explanation). This will make high-speed internet available in the most remote polar locations of our planet.</p>



<p>The SmallSat rideshare program by SpaceX enables customers in launching their satellites to low Earth orbit (LEO) with a budget as low as $1M. In this dedicated launch, most of the small satellites were of SpaceX customers, in the past, SpaceX has been making space for a small number of customer satellites with the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/06/14/falcon-9-starlink-launch-58/">Starlink constellation satellites.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s space exploration &amp; commercial spaceflight company has used optical laser-linking of the satellites for the first time. Musk has confirmed on Twitter that the black pipe-type objects at the end of each Starlink satellite are actually laser links. I have marked these objects in the following photo of the SmallSat satellite stack photo shared by SpaceX before the launch.</p>

<p>According to Musk, only the polar <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> satellites sent to orbit this year will have laser links, all the other Starlink satellites will get laser-linking feature next year. SpaceX has given the current laser-linked satellites a version number of v0.9, Musk explained.</p>

<h2>Why Laser Links?</h2>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snoshy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">u/snoshy</a> provided much-needed insight on the use of ‘laser links’ on Starlink satellites as the article made it to the HN front page.</p>



<blockquote><p>These laser links are purely intended for satellite-to-satellite communications for Starlink. They are not (at least at this time, and for the foreseeable future) intended for ground-to-satellite communications.</p><p>The value that sat-to-sat laser links provide is that they create a low latency, high bandwidth path that stays within the Starlink satellite network. Before these 10 satellites, each Starlink satellite has only been capable of communicating directly to ground terminals (either consumer, transit or SpaceX control). For traffic that is intended to move large geographic distances (think transcontinental), this can require several hops back and forth between ground and space, or the traffic from the user terminal is exited at a node that is geared for transiting traffic and most of the data transits along with existing ground Internet links.</p><p>By performing this type of transit directly in space, and exiting at a transit node nearest the destination for the data, you greatly reduce latency. Bandwidth still might not be great, but what this does is unlocks a very financially lucrative consumer use case: low latency finance traffic and critical communications. </p><p>There are many use cases around the world where shaving even 10-20 milliseconds of latency on a data path can unlock finance and emergency capabilities, and this is a long-fought battle throughout the history of these industries. As an example, if you got a piece of news about a company in Australia, and wanted to trade on it as quickly as possible in the USA if you can beat your competitors by 10-20 milliseconds, that can mean a lot of money.</p><p>Laser comms for Starlink sats have long been planned, but have historically proven to be quite hard to get working. They also depend on a sufficient critical mass of satellites so that a given satellite actually does have another satellite within the lock to send the traffic towards.</p><cite>u/snoshy via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25906513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker News discussion</a>.</cite></blockquote>

                    <h2 id="the-case-for-buying-an-expensive-pair-of-headphones">The case for buying an expensive pair of headphones</h2><p>Like many of us, I found myself working from home at the start of the pandemic. Initially I set myself up in the sitting room but as things progressed to the semi-permanent, we got rid of the office for my startup <a href="https://ruffly.com/">Ruffly</a> and I decided to move somewhere that wasn't stealing another space from the rest of the family.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>My wonderful wife works from home permanently in a home office and I could have moved in beside her. However, she has a tendendency to break into loud peals of laughter during conference calls which I find endearing through a closed door but has a high possibility of leading to divorce from 2 feet away.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

</section>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The place chosen in our house was the upstairs landing. A space that already had a desk and chair that had been set up with a computer in an observable place for the kids to use, back when we niavely thought, pre-pandemic, that we would be rationing screen time for them.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> This space is exposed to the comings and goings of 3 children, the dog Dougal and my aforementioned wife. It is open to the main hallway of the house which has a wooden floor. All the doors in our house are Edwardian and make a terrifyingly loud <em>ka-thunk</em> when they close. I have line-of-sight down the stairs into the kitchen, a room which has the capacity to produce an array of metallic sounds that frankly astonish me - more on these later. All this to say, this is not a naturally quiet space.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>After the first lock-down ended and the children were packed off back to their incubation pods at school, life got tolerably quiet and I was able to worry about more minor auditory annoyances in life. The cupula above our hallway has an airgap for some reason, and it lets in the dull hubbub of the primary school playground next door. I spent an uncomfortable weekend up a ladder, filling the gaps with a noise insulating expanding foam.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Despite this, I gradually started to wonder if Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) headphones of some sort might be a good answer for working from this new space.</p>
<hr>
<section>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In December 2020, Apple announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/">Airpods Max</a> and reviewers started waxing lyrical about how amazing these (extremely expensive) new ANC headphones from Apple truly were. As an Apple-eco-system stalwart, I considered that if I was going to spend <em>hundreds</em> of pounds on a pair of great ANC headphones, it might as well be <em>a couple more hundreds</em> of pounds for an <em>Apple</em> pair of headphones that would a) give the best performance and b) "just work" with all my Apple kit. As threats of a second school lock-down came to fruition I bit the bullet and ordered a pair.</p><h2 id="my-requirements">My requirements</h2><p>At this point its worth stating what I was <em>hoping</em> for from the Airpods Max, in priority order:</p><ol><li>Headphone noise cancellation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants coming to my ears</li><li>Microphone voice isolation that would cut out the noise of the house and it's occupants reaching the ears of participants on video calls</li><li>Good-to-great sound quality of my voice on video calls</li><li>Great sound quality for listening to music while working</li></ol><h2 id="most-of-what-has-been-written-about-the-airpods-max-is-true">Most of what has been written about the Airpods Max is true</h2><p>The headphones arrived the second full week of January, a week before my wife and I had to start home-schooling the kids again but a time when both of us were back juggling full-time jobs with minding our 6, 8 and 10 year olds, plus the 10 month old puppy. </p><p>I'm not going to say much about the good bits of the Airpods Max because plenty has already been written on that. They do sound really great for music and for films. The most noticable thing to me was the way they project the sound in front of me when I'm listening to a normal stereo video on Youtube/Twitter/TikTok etc on the iPhone. It comes across as a very definite sound projection of about 30cms. I wouldn't say I like it especially more, but it's definitely a thing.</p><p>The ANC is exceptionally good at cutting out background noise. It fades it when you turn it on and I love the effect - it brings to mind a sound <em>animation</em>. I have subsequently tried a pair of Bose NC 700s and I can categorically say that the ANC on the Airpods Max is more effective at cutting out the normal background noise in my house.</p><p>However, as implied by the title, this isn't an article with a happy ending. In the end I had to send the Airpods Max back to Apple for a refund because they were four things that just did not work out for my use case. Without further ado, here they are...</p><h2 id="the-noise-cancellation-sucked">The noise cancellation sucked</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's tak about that ANC again. The use of 'sucked' in the title isn't (just) click-bait. The very first thing I noticed about the Airpods Max was that the ANC didn't feel great in my ears. I'd describe it as like the feeling you have when you need to repressurise your ears on an airplane. It doesn't bother you particularly at the time but when you swallow you realise it feels better. Taking off the Airpods Max felt like returning my inner ears to their natural, unadorned state. When I posted this on Twitter, @madmax helpfully pointed me to <a href="https://www.soundstagesolo.com/index.php/features/178-eardrum-suck-the-mystery-solved">an article</a> about <em>Eardrum Suck</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> which I'm inclined to believe is the issue here. The ANC effect is very good at filtering out background noise, but it definitely <em>feels</em> like an effect.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>And then there is event noise. Event noise is what I'm calling any sudden loud noise that is over and above the normal background din. In my environment that is raised voices, dog barks, footsteps on the wooden floor, metallic noises from the kitchen and the previously described <em>ka-thunk</em> of closing doors. The ANC on the Airpods Max does not do well with any of these. To be fair it is a tough challenge. But what I was not expecting, what blew me away<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> was that low frequency event noise (e.g. a <em>ka-thunk</em> of a door) could actually create an uncomfortable ANC burp right into my ear drum. Like a Q-tip that's gone too deep. It's not pleasant and it happens every 10 minutes in my house. Imagine that - a Q-tip to the ear drum every 10 minutes! It doesn't take much of that to make a man want to take his headphones off his irreplaceable ear drums, no matter how expensive they were!</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="they-do-not-sound-good-for-wireless-calls-on-the-mac">They do not sound good for wireless calls on the Mac</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Believe me when I say I wish I this wasn't true. Apple have done a magnificent job of making the bluetooth wireless experience acceptable when you are listening to music. It's damned near perfect on the iPhone, and given the crapshoot that is bluetooth accessories on the Mac - it worked really quite well there too.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Without going in to too many details (I have researched the death out of this trying to get it to work), when the Airpods Max are connected as an output device, macOS will negotiate a 48kHz streaming audio session using AAC. It might not convince some music purists but it sounds just peachy to me. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When, however you tell macOS to use the Airpods Max as an input device things start to go downhill. It will negotiate a two-way SCO connection that reduces the audio quality for both the input and the output device. Yes that's right. If the microphone is active, everything sounds worse too. How much worse? Well I'm glad you asked. My desktop Mac<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> uses a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset. When the Airpods Max connect to a Bluetooth 4.0 chipset you end up with 8kHz audio. You can search the internet for this - it also happens for the regular Airpods and Airpods Pro. If you've been on a Zoom call with someone using Airpods that sounded like they are on the world's worst telephone - this is probably the reason. It can support 48kHz streaming audio simplex but only 8kHz duplex. I'm not a Bluetooth engineer but something doesn't add up here.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I also have a &nbsp;2015 era MacBook pro that has a Bluetooth 4.2 chipset. This chipset can support a 16kHz duplex connection to the Airpods Max. It's better... and frankly if my desktop Mac had been able to achieve this I might not have noticed the quality problem until after the return window had closed. But we are still getting a sub-par audio experience if the microphones are in use. The standard response from pretty much <em>everyone</em> on the internet is to turn off the device as an input source and use the internal microphone on your machine. They even have complicated instructions on how to fool the Mac into doing this automatically and one of the most popular apps for Airpods management <a href="https://c-command.com/toothfairy/">ToothFairy</a> has the ability to force this built-in. </p><p>Hell no.</p><p>I did not spend all this money on headphones with noise-isolating microphones just to <em>turn it off</em>.</p><p>On my iPhone 11 Pro things are better still. It is able to &nbsp;support a 24kHz duplex connection to the Airpods Max, which (if I'm reading the debug messages correctly) might even be using the AAC codec. I'm not sure if this is a Bluetooth 5.0 bandwidth capability or something else. But suffice to say that if you are getting 24kHz duplex then you can probably stop worrying about wireless quality problems. I wish I had a modern Mac with Bluetooth 5 built in to verify that the same is acheiveable on a modern chipset Mac. I'd be willing to believe so and it leaves me confident that Apple are <em>never</em> going to invest the time in making this better for older hardware. Heck, if it's great on the iPhone and not great on the Mac, that's probably ok by them too.</p><h2 id="what-8khz-audio-sounds-like">What 8kHz audio sounds like</h2><p>I recorded some samples to drive this home.

Now, Trump's presidency is in its dying days. He has been impeached by the House again, this time for "incitement of insurrection."

as the company pushes forward with better batteries and a commitment to greener air travel.</p><div><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="" sizes=""

of the world’s first fully electric commercial aircraft at YVR airport in Richmond, British Columbia on Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2019. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Ben Nelms/CBC)</figcaption></figure><p><span><p>A Vancouver seaplane company says its retro-fitted all electric airplane is set to take to the skies for more test flights this year, as it pushes forward with its plans to make commercial air travel cheaper and greener.</p>  <p>"There's no wavering in our confidence and determination and interest in getting this done," said Harbour Air&nbsp;CEO Greg McDougall.</p>  <p>Founded by McDougall in 1982, Harbour Air uses small propeller planes to fly commercial flights between the Lower Mainland, Seattle, Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and Whistler.</p>  <p>In the last few years it has <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/world-s-first-all-electric-commercial-seaplane-set-for-takeoff-in-richmond-1.5378163" target="_blank">turned its attention to becoming a leader in green urban mobility</a>, which would do away with the need to burn fossil fuels for air travel.</p>  <p>In December 2019, McDougall flew one of Harbour Air's planes, a more than 60-year-old &nbsp;DHC-2 de Havilland Beaver float plane, which had been outfitted with a Seattle-based company's electric propulsion system, for three minutes over Richmond B.C.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div

over the Fraser River for three minutes today in its debut test flight.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:26</span></span></span></p>  <p>Harbour Air joined with Seattle-based company MagniX in early 2019 to design the e-plane's engine, which was powered by NASA-approved lithium-ion batteries that were also used on the International Space Station.</p>  <p>At the time, based on the success of that inaugural flight, McDougall had hoped to be using the plane to fly passengers on its routes, such as between downtown Vancouver and downtown Victoria, by the end of this year.</p>  <p>Now, that timeline has been pushed back at least one year due to the pandemic.</p>  <p>"It's progressing, not as quickly as we hoped due to COVID, but we are getting back on track with the testing program," said McDougall.</p>    <p>Harbour Air has to prove to Transport Canada that its e-plane is as safe as its other conventional planes to allow it to fly with passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says Ottawa has approved a new permit to allow the company to continue with test flights this year, which will be used to improve the plane and all its components.</p>  <h2>New batteries</h2>  <p>Despite the setback from the pandemic, the company stands to benefit from advances in battery technology.</p>  <p>It has partnered with a new company for a different battery that is lighter and provides more power than what was used a year ago.</p>  <p>Analysts of the sector say the success of companies like Harbour Air to fly all-electric in a commercially successful way is completely dependent upon the energy system.</p>  <p>"Technologically, the real challenge is to make the batteries lighter," said Werner Antweiler, a professor of economics at UBC's&nbsp;Sauder School of Business who studies the commercialization of novel technologies around mobility.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt=""

seaplane in late December 2019.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Harbour Air)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The problem with lithium batteries is they are heavy, which means the plane Harbour Air is using them on quickly meets its weight capacity even without passengers.</p>  <p>McDougall says battery technology is advancing quickly and he expects them to be even lighter and more powerful, as his project gets closer to flying commercially.</p>  <p>Antweiler says Harbour Air is in the "sweet spot" in the industry as its flights are short, meaning battery technology as it stands today makes the project viable.</p>  <p>"That is an ideal application because the batteries won't get you any farther than that range," he said about the length of flights Harbour Air does.</p>  <p>Getting on an all-electric jetliner to fly across Canada, he says,&nbsp;is decades away.</p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>With more and more content being hosted on GitHub it's a shame that you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. At least not by GitHub, that is. But you can build your own notification service. Here is how.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-notification.png" alt="Adaptive card with a notification about a changed file on GitHub displayed in Microsoft Teams"> </picture> <h2>More than source control</h2> <p>GitHub is more than just the place where developers post their code. Over the last few years, it evolved also into a huge repository of content published through blogs and docs. For many, it's the go-to place to stay up-to-date on what's new.</p> <p>While GitHub offers us a way to get notified of changes to repos, the notifications options are limited. You can get notified of new releases or pull requests, but you can't get notified when a particular file has changed. With many devs using specific pages for announcing releases or keeping their changelog, being able to get notified of changes to these specific files, allows you to stay up-to-date on what's new and what's coming.</p> <h2>Build your own GitHub file changes notifier</h2> <p>To build your own GitHub file changes notifier, all you need is an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure subscription</a>. In the subscription, you will create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">function app</a>, a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/storage/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storage account</a> and a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logic app</a>. Here is the high-level of the solution architecture:</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing architecture of the solution"> </picture> <p>The storage account holds the list of files to check for changes. For each file, you will store its URL, title - for use with notifications, and a hash of its contents used to determine if the file has changed since the last time.</p> <p>The function app hosts the scheduled process that at the specified time retrieves the list of files from the storage account (1), iterates through them, for each (2) one checks if it changed and sends a notification if it did (3). If the file has changed, the function app also updates the file hash in the storage account (4).</p> <p>While there are unlimited ways to send a notification, I find using logic apps the easiest. Logic apps are extremely versatile and with just a few clicks you can set them up to receive notifications on Teams, via email, or on your phone, without having to deal with authentication, response handling, etc.</p> <h3>Set up a storage account</h3> <p>Start, by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a storage account</a> in your resource group. In the storage account, create a table named <code>files</code>. For each file that you want to track, insert an item to the table including its <code>title</code> and <code>url</code>.</p> <picture> <source srcset="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.webp" type="image/webp"> <img src="https://blog.mastykarz.nl/assets/images/2020/12/githubwatch-insertentity.png" alt="Table row showing information about a file on GitHub to monitor for changes"> </picture> <p>For each file, use the same partition key and a unique row key.</p> <h3>Create a logic app for sending notifications</h3> <p>In this example, we'll <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow?WT.mc_id=m365-12160-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a logic app</a> that sends a notification to the user on Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>In your resource group, create a logic app. Use the <strong>When a HTTP request is received</strong> trigger.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let's walk through the different pieces of the script.</p> <h4>Load dependencies</h4> <p>Start, by loading the necessary dependencies:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>axios</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>axios</span><span>'</span><span>).</span><span>default</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We'll use <strong>axios</strong> to execute web requests to download files and trigger notifications. <strong>axios</strong> makes it way easier than using the raw HTTP calls from Node.js. We also need the crypto functions so that we can calculate the hash for the downloaded file contents.</p> <h4>Reference input binding</h4> <p>Extend the function's function to include the <strong>Table parameter name</strong> you copied previously. This argument will contain all files that you've added to the storage account.</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>timer</span><span>,</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <h4>Store information about changed files</h4> <p>Next, let's define two arrays for storing information about changed files:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// array of files that have changed</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFiles</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
<span>// array of notifications</span>
<span>const</span> <span>modifiedFilesNotifications</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We need two arrays because if we've just added a file to the storage account, its hash (<code>null</code>) will not match the hash retrieved from GitHub and would result in you getting a notification that the file has changed, while it's not quite the case. Storing information about the file that changed and files for which we should issue a notification allows avoiding the unnecessary initial notification.</p> <h4>Retrieve file contents</h4> <p>Then, let's retrieve contents of all files we're tracking:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// retrieve file contents</span>
<span>const</span> <span>requests</span> <span>=</span> <span>inFilesTable</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>file</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><main><p>A single-threaded event loop like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but, SPOILER ALERT: race conditions are still possible!</p><p>In this article, we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help us to make our code <em>race condition free</em>.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-race-condition%3F">What is a race condition?</h2><p>First of all, let's try to clarify what a <em>race condition</em> actually is.</p><p>A race condition is a type of <em>programming error</em> that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance, a file on a file system or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.</p><p>Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a thread is trying to rename a file, another thread is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the second thread will receive an error because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been renamed. Or, the other way around, while one thread is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other thread and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.</p><p>In other cases, race conditions can be more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>A classic example is when 2 threads are trying to update the same data source and the new information is the result of a function applied to the current value.</p><p>Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus"><em>aureus</em></a> (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is <code>0</code> <em>aurei</em> and that there are two independent game components (possibly running on separate threads) that are trying to increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> each, we should expect that in the end, the balance is <code>100</code> <em>aurei</em>, right?</p><pre><code>0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘</code></pre><p>If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:</p><ol><li>Read the current value for <code>balance</code></li><li>Add <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> to it</li><li>Save the resulting value into <code>balance</code></li></ol><p>Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-2002.webp 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="A race condition example showing 2 processes trying to update a balance" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-race-condition-node-js-8e3027ab-64.png" width="64" height="30"></picture></span><p>In the picture above you can see that <strong>Component 2</strong> ends up having a <em>stale</em> view of the balance: the balance gets changed by <strong>Component 1</strong> after <strong>Component 2</strong> has read the balance. For this reason, when <strong>Component 2</strong> performs its own update, it is effectively overriding any change previously made by <strong>Component 1</strong>. This is why we have a race condition: the two components are effectively racing to complete their own tasks and they might end up stepping onto each other's toes! This doesn't make <em>Julius</em> happy I am afraid...</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to isolate the 2 concurrent operations into <em>transactions</em> and make sure that there is only one transaction running at a given time. This idea might look like this:</p><span><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.png 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.png 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.png 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.png 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.webp 64w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-128.webp 128w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-256.webp 256w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-512.webp 512w, https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-2022.webp 2022w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" alt="Fixing a race condition using a transaction" src="https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/img/aurei-fixed-race-condition-node-js-a2696610-64.png" width="64" height="31"></picture></span><p>In the last picture, we are using transactions to make sure that all the steps of <strong>Component 1</strong> happen in order before all the steps of <strong>Component 2</strong>. This prevents any <em>stale read</em> and makes sure that every component always has an up to date view of the world before doing any change. You can stop holding your breath now, Julius!</p><p>In the rest of this article, we will zoom in more on race conditions in the context of Node.js and we will see some other approaches to deal with them.</p><h2 id="can-we-have-race-conditions-in-node.js%3F">Can we have race conditions in Node.js?</h2><p>It is a common misconception to think that Node.js does not have race conditions because of its single-threaded nature. While it is true that in Node.js you would not have multiple threads competing for resources, you might still end up with tasks belonging to different logical transactions being executed in an order that might result in <em>stale reads</em> and generate a race condition.</p><p>In the example that we illustrated above, we intentionally represented the various tasks (<em>read</em>, <em>increase</em> and <em>save</em>) as discrete units. Note how the system is never executing more than one task at the same time. This is a simple but accurate representation of how the Node.js event loop processes tasks on a single thread. Nonetheless, you can see that there might be situations where multiple logical transactions (e.g. multiple deposits) are scheduled concurrently on the event loop and the discrete tasks might end up being intermingled, which results in a race condition.</p><p>So... <strong>Yes</strong>, we can have race conditions in Node.js!</p><h2 id="a-node.js-example-with-a-race-condition">A Node.js example with a race condition</h2><p>Now, let's talk some code! Let's try to re-create the Roman Empire simulation game example that we discussed above.</p><p>In ancient Rome, Romans used to export olives and grapes. No wonder Italy is still famous worldwide for olive oil and wine! In our game, we want to be able to harvest olives and grapes and then sell them as a means to acquire more <em>aurei</em>.</p><p>We are going to have two functions that can increase the balance by <code>50</code> <em>aurei</em> which we are going to call <code>sellOlives()</code> and <code>sellGrapes()</code>. We will also assume that every time the balance is changed, it is persisted to a data storage of sort (e.g. a database). For the sake of this example, we won't be using a real data storage, but we will just simulate some random asynchronous delay before reading or modifying a global value. This will be enough to illustrate how we can end up with a race condition.</p><p>For starts, let's see what a buggy implementation might look like:</p><pre><code><br><br><span>const</span> <span>randomDelay</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>(</span><span>resolve</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>resolve<span>,</span> Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>100</span><span>)</span><br><span>)</span><p><br><br><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>0</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>loadBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  <span>return</span> balance<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>saveBalance</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <br>  <span>await</span> <span>randomDelay</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  balance <span>=</span> value<br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellGrapes</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellGrapes - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>sellOlives</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance loaded: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br>  <span>const</span> newBalance <span>=</span> balance <span>+</span> <span>50</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>saveBalance</span><span>(</span>newBalance<span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>sellOlives - balance updated: </span><span><span>${</span>newBalance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>const</span> transaction1 <span>=</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>const</span> transaction2 <span>=</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> transaction1 <br>                     <br>  <span>await</span> transaction2<br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>If we execute this code we might end up with different results. In one case we might get the correct outcome:</p><pre><code>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 50<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>But in other cases we might end up in a bad state:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 50<br>Final balance: 50</code></pre><p>Note how in this last case, <code>sellOlives</code> is essentially a stale read and therefore it will end up overriding the balance disregarding any work already done by <code>sellGrapes</code>. Yes, we do have a race condition, unfortunately!</p><p>Now, this example is simple ad it is not too hard to pinpoint exactly where the race condition has originated by just looking at the code.</p><p>Take a minute or two to read the code again. Check out the output from the 2 cases as well. Pay attention to the notes and the log messages and try to imagine how the Node.js runtime might execute this code in the 2 different scenarios.</p><p>Ok, now that you have done that, let's discuss together what happens.</p><p>In our <code>main</code> function, when we execute <code>sellGrapes()</code> and <code>sellOlives()</code>, since we are not awaiting the two operations independently, we are essentially scheduling both operations onto the event loop.</p><p>We only await the two transactions after they have been already scheduled, which means that they will work concurrently. After the two transactions have been scheduled, we wait for <code>transaction1</code> to complete and only then we wait for <code>transaction2</code> to complete. Note that <code>transaction2</code> might complete even before <code>transaction1</code>. In other words, awaiting for <code>transaction1</code> doesn't block <code>transaction2</code> in any way.</p><p>This approach is similar to writing the following code:</p><pre><code><span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Using <code>Promise.all()</code> is a more commonly used way to schedule different tasks to run concurrently.</p><p>Note that with <code>Promise.all()</code>, the resulting promise will reject as soon as any of the promises rejects. In our previous example, since we await the two promises independently, we will always catch errors in <code>transaction1</code> before <code>transaction2</code>.</p><p>But let's not digress too much into this. Now that we understand the problem, how do we fix the race condition?</p><p>Well, it turns out that in this simple case, we might make things right quite easily:</p><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellGrapes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>  <span>await</span> <span>sellOlives</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <br>                     <br>  <span>const</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>loadBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`</span><span>Final balance: </span><span><span>${</span>balance<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This implementation will consistently produce the following output:</p><pre><code>sellGrapes - balance loaded: 0<br>sellGrapes - balance updated: 50<br>sellOlives - balance loaded: 50<br>sellOlives - balance updated: 100<br>Final balance: 100</code></pre><p>As we can observe, <code>sellGrapes</code> is always started and completed <em>before</em> we start <code>sellOlives</code>. This makes the two logical transactions isolated and makes sure their tasks won't end up being mixed together in random order.</p><p>Problem solved... <em>vade in pacem</em> dear race condition!</p><h2 id="using-a-mutex-in-node.js">Using a mutex in Node.js</h2><p>OK, the previous example was illustrative, but if we are building a real game, chances are things will end up being a lot more complicated. We will probably end up having many different actions that might cause a change of balance. Those actions might be the result of a particular sequence of events and it might become hard to track down the discrete logical …</p></main></article></div>

  <p>I recently built a static website for a friend using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We installed everything he needed to add content to his website on his laptop. And by all I mean just Hugo and Visual Studio Code. Then he reset his laptop and that set me thinking if we can do with even less, preferably installing nothing at all on his computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> came to mind. With GitHub Codespaces (currently in early access) we get a full VSCode powered development environment in the browser. Best of all it runs in an Ubuntu container giving terminal access, includes tools like Hugo out of the box and handles port forwarding for us.</p>
<p>There's something to be aware of with the automatic port forwarding and static assets such as images. So in this post I'll show how you can build and debug a static site built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> in GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>We'll first create an empty repository in GitHub. Make sure to add an empty README file, so we can easily open it with codespaces later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-repository.png" alt="Create new repository with README"></p>
<p>Open GitHub Codespaces in the navigation bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespaces.png" alt="Codespaces link in the GitHub navbar"></p>
<p>Then create a new Codespace by selecting our repository.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/new-codespace.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<p>After a minute your VSCode environment should be ready to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/codespace-ready.png" alt="Create new codespace by seleting a repository"></p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. We'll run the commands of the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo quick start</a> with one modification. If you prefer to just look at the code, check out the <a href="https://github.com/shotor/hugo-codespaces-example">repository</a>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># create a new site in the root folder, force it because it's not empty
</span><span>hugo</span><span> new site .</span><span> --force

</span><span># add ananke theme
</span><span>git</span><span> submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke

</span><span># set theme
</span><span>echo </span><span>'theme = "ananke"' </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> config.toml

</span><span># create new post
</span><span>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
</span></code></pre>
<p>We'll add some content to our <code>my-first-post.md</code> file and also an image that we'll place in the <code>/static</code> folder (just drag it into the sidebar of your Codespace).</p>
<pre><code data-lang="md"><span>---
</span><span>title: 'My First Post'
date: 2021-01-24T12:00:00Z
</span><span>---

</span><span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus in fringilla libero.

</span><span>![</span><span>Placeholder image</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>/image.png</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we'll forward the port in the remote explorer tab. We know Hugo will run on 1313, so that's the port we will forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://shotor.com/blog/build-a-hugo-static-site-in-your-browser-using-github-codespaces/port-forward.png" alt="Our forwarded port"></p>
<p>Now if we just run Hugo (<code>hugo server -D</code>) our homepage will work fine. But any internal link or image will fail with a 404 error because it refers to localhost and not our GitHub url. And also there's a port included in all the links.</p>
<p>To fix this we run a modified start command where we set the <code>baseUrl</code> to the url provided by GitHub. We can get this url by right clicking on our forwarded port, and copying the url. We also need to disable the port section (in this case :1313). Our command becomes:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>hugo</span><span> server</span><span> -D --baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://your-github-url"</span><span> --appendPort</span><span>=</span><span>false
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now when we click on our first post, we'll see the blog post as well as the image we uploaded.</p>
<p>That's it, we now have a full development workflow completely in our browser. We can access it from anywhere to add content or make changes to the layout.</p>
<p>In this case we used Hugo, a static site generator. But this idea can be adapted to any type of webserver, for instance NodeJS or Django. As long as you bind the server to localhost and then forward the port. Making sure any internal links or images use the forwarded url as its base url.</p>
<h2 id="deployments-using-netlify">Deployments using Netlify</h2>
<p>To finish it off we'll add deployments using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. We'll follow <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">the Hugo tutorial</a> and create a <code>netlify.toml</code> file in the root directory.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>[</span><span>build</span><span>]

</span><span>HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO </span><span>= </span><span>"true"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure we set the base url in <code>config.toml</code> to our Netlify url:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="toml"><span>baseURL </span><span>= </span><span>"https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/"

</span><span>title </span><span>= </span><span>"Hugo Codespaces Example"
</span><span>theme </span><span>= </span><span>"ananke"
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can now commit and push all our changes. Which will trigger a build and deploy our static site. We can also create Pull Requests and have Netlify create preview environments for us, so we can test changes before merging them.</p>
<p>Our site is now live at <a href="https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/">https://pensive-sammet-17c943.netlify.app/</a></p>
<p>All that's left to do is <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/">add a custom domain</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Codespaces makes it really easy to work on projects hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>There are limitations, the Ubuntu container doesn't allow you to run just any command you want, which makes sense.</p>
<p>For instance I tried to run a <a href="https://getzola.org/">Zola</a> project, but Zola requires <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snapcraft</a>. Which is not included and cannot be installed in Codespaces. To get Zola working I had to upload the Zola binary file myself. No big deal, but on a local or a self-hosted remote vscode environment this is a non-issue.</p>
<p>Right now I'm only using it for small projects. I'm very interested to see how it holds up with bigger projects. In terms of size, as well things required from the operating system.</p>

<p>After a decade of fierce rivalry with China's technology giant Huawei, Europe's telecoms equipment champions Nokia and Ericsson could soon face myriad new competitors to contend with.</p>



<p>As Europe cuts back on using Huawei equipment in its 5G networks, mobile operators are looking far and wide for companies to replace it. The Continent's "big four" telcos Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica, Vodafone and Orange on Wednesday <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">published</a> a joint "<a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20/POLITICO-Memorandum-of-Understanding-OPEN-RAN-big-four-operators-January-2021.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a>" pledging to prioritize the development of "Open RAN" technology, a concept that would benefit smaller equipment and software makers.</p>



<p>Open RAN encompasses the idea of chopping up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and imposing standards on equipment and software firms so their products can work together — a "Lego approach," as one expert called it, to digital infrastructure. It would allow operators to procure specialized kit and services in smaller contracts with different players to piece together a 5G network, breaking the market power of “end-to-end” vendors like Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The operators' public campaign in favor of the standards comes after years of lobbying against 5G security laws that will significantly decrease Huawei's market presence in Europe in coming years. The operators, now barred by governments from using Huawei in several European markets, see Open RAN as a fix to what they consider a duopoly in the vendor market that allows Ericsson and Nokia to charge higher prices for 5G equipment.</p>



<p>Once in place, Open RAN could help equipment makers like South Korea’s Samsung and Japan’s NEC, cloud providers and tech giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft as well as smaller, specialized software companies like Altiostar and Mavenir gain a stronger foothold in Europe’s growing 5G market.</p>



<p>The big four operators said they'd also "promote to European policymakers and industry that adopting a competitive Open RAN ecosystem will place Europe and European industry at the front in the race of technological leadership."</p>



<p>But for the two European leading vendors, Ericsson and Nokia, the political push to boost new competitors could put more strain on already-narrow profit margins and troubled financials.</p>



<h3>Geopolitics of standards</h3>



<p>Operators across the world in 2018 started working on new standards in an association called the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org/about" target="_blank">O-RAN Alliance</a>. It's a standard-setting body that includes participants from more than 200 companies across the tech sector, including Microsoft, Facebook, chipmakers, software firms and Europe's leading vendors Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>The O-RAN Alliance includes Chinese operators but not its tech giant Huawei — which is telling. </p>



<p>The Chinese giant has always perceived Open RAN as a challenge to its dominance: "O-RAN is currently hijacked for geo-political reasons. It's been weaponized, specifically against Huawei," a company official said in a conversation in June, requesting not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p>



<p>The push for Open RAN standards quickly gained pace in the U.S., where lawmakers realized the country's technology industry had missed the boat on developing 5G equipment.</p>



<p>U.S. Congress in November <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20201118/policy/house-unanimously-passes-750-million-open-ran-5g-bill" target="_blank">passed a bill</a> approving $750 million in public funding to develop Open RAN technologies.   </p>



<p>The U.S. tech industry has also been leaning on European capitals through a lobby group called the <a href="https://www.openranpolicy.org/about-us/members/" target="_blank">Open RAN Policy Coalition</a>, formed in May last year. It gathers smaller U.S. software firms like Altiostar and Mavenir with household names like Cisco and Juniper and tech giants Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel and others. Non-U.S. names include Samsung, NEC, Fujitsu, Rakuten, as well as Europe's three largest telecoms operators and Nokia.</p>



<p>"One thing we've heard from European governments ... is that a diverse ecosystem is very important and they want to see that European vendors have a share of the market," said Alex Botting, senior director at Venable, a lobby firm that represents the coalition in talks with European authorities. </p>



<p>In London, the initiative got backing from the government when it <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1532681">presented</a> its "diversification strategy" in November. It pledged £250 million in funding to boost innovation in Open RAN and try to introduce new, smaller 5G equipment makers. It also pledged to fund a new trial with Japanese telecoms vendor NEC.</p>



<h3>Europe's gain, Europe's loss</h3>



<p>For European lawmakers, the question is which specific European companies would gain from Open RAN — besides the operators that expect it to bring down procurement prices.</p>



<p>The concept comes with risks to its own leaders in the field, Ericsson and Nokia, who increasingly have free range in markets that have blocked or are shunning Chinese vendors. </p>



<p>"If you break that duopoly and you have lots of new suppliers, what does that do to the two European incumbents?" said Alex Sinclair, chief technology officer at global telecoms operators association GSMA.</p>



<p>Nokia has arguably been more receptive to the idea of Open RAN, but Ericsson has been lukewarm. </p>



<p>Its Chief Technology Officer Erik Ekudden said <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">in an interview in July</a> that the technology was still&nbsp;“maturing.” He said the telecoms network market was already open for competitors to try and enter, but few had succeeded because it's a tough market. “We have a consolidated market, we have relatively few radio access network vendors … But it’s still an extremely competitive market,” Ekudden said.  </p>



<p>Lawmakers in Europe have still sought to diversify telecoms vendors as part of the EU's "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_123" target="_blank">5G security toolbox</a>" process that aimed to decrease the dependency on Huawei. </p>



<p>Regulators, lawmakers and industry officials are exploring policy options to soften the blow of phasing out Huawei, in working groups within the EU's digital services department as well as in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/nis-cooperation-group" target="_blank">NIS Cooperation Group</a>, a roundtable of cybersecurity experts of EU countries and the Commission.</p>



<p>In Berlin, the government also expressed support for Open RAN in recent updates of telecoms security rules, and operators have launched <a href="https://uk.nec.com/en_GB/press/202012/global_20201216_01.html" target="_blank">pilot projects</a> with new vendors already. </p>



<h3>Technical challenges ahead</h3>



<p>Above all, the operators' document Wednesday is a signal to both the industry's supply chain and the regulators overseeing it that they take Open RAN seriously.</p>



<p>In the document, they pledged to work together on Open RAN standards, invest in developing the technology and push governments and regulators to contribute research funding and “policy support.”</p>



<p>The four telcos, together with U.S. and Chinese counterparts like AT&amp;T, Verizon, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom and others, buy the most network equipment. A choice for a certain technology is certain to spur research by suppliers in coming years, and that could speed up the process to get large Open RAN networks up and running. </p>



<p>"Left to its natural course, this would probably take many years to become significant," said GSMA's Sinclair, adding that operators' public support "is all about accelerating this."</p>



<p>But running a network of smaller building blocks also increases technical headaches, he said: "If you're dealing with smaller suppliers, you have quite a lot of procurement problems," adding Open RAN networks would need a "system integrator" company to manage all the different parts — a role that operators in past decades have sourced out to vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>2020 was an intense year. I hope you're healthy and keep being healthy. I am privileged (as lots of software engineers and academics are) to be able to work from home during the pandemic. Let's not forget people in less privileged situations,  and let’s try to give them as much practical, psychological and financial support as we can these days. And as much joy as possible to everyone around :)</p>
<p>I cancelled the autumn MirageOS retreat due to the pandemic. Instead I collected donations for our hosts in Marrakech - they were very happy to receive our financial support, since they had a difficult year, since their income is based on tourism. I hope that in autumn 2021 we'll have an on-site retreat again.</p>
<p>For 2021, we (at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a>) got a grant from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS" (more details below), and another grant from <a href="https://ocaml-sf.org/">OCaml software foundation</a> for securing the opam supply chain (using <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a>). Some long-awaited releases for MirageOS libraries, namely a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">ssh implementation</a> and a rewrite of our <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git implementation</a> have already been published.</p>
<p>With my MirageOS view, 2020 was a pretty successful year, where we managed to add more features, fixed lots of bugs, and paved the road ahead. I want to thank <a href="https://ocamllabs.io/">OCamlLabs</a> for funding work on MirageOS maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="Recap-2020">Recap 2020</h2>

<p>Here is a very subjective random collection of accomplishments in 2020, where I was involved with some degree.</p>
<h3 id="NetHSM">NetHSM</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nethsm">NetHSM</a> is a hardware security module in software. It is a product that uses MirageOS for security, and is based on the <a href="https://muen.sk/">muen</a> separation kernel. We at <a href="https://robur.coop/">robur</a> were heavily involved in this product. It already has been security audited by an external team. You can pre-order it from Nitrokey.</p>
<h3 id="TLS-1-3">TLS 1.3</h3>

<p>Dating back to 2016, at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2016/tron-workshop-programme/">TRON</a> (TLS 1.3 Ready or NOt), we developed a first draft of a 1.3 implementation of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls">OCaml-TLS</a>. Finally in May 2020 we got our act together, including ECC (ECDH P256 from <a href="https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto/">fiat</a>, X25519 from <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">hacl</a>) and testing with <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer">tlsfuzzer</a>, and release tls 0.12.0 with TLS 1.3 support. Later we added <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ECC ciphersuites to TLS version 1.2</a>, implemented <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/414">ChaCha20/Poly1305</a>, and fixed an <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/pull/424">interoperability issue with Go's implementation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto">Mirage-crypto</a> provides the underlying cryptographic primitives, initially released in March 2020 as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto">nocrypto</a> -- huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pqwy">pqwy</a> for his great work. Mirage-crypto detects <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/53">CPU features at runtime</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Julow">Julow</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/96">bugfix for bswap</a>), using constant time modular exponentation (powm_sec) and hardens against Lenstra's CRT attack, supports <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/39">compilation on Windows</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/avsm">avsm</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/90">async entropy harvesting</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/seliopou">seliopou</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/65">32 bit support</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/72">chacha20/poly1305</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/abeaumont">abeaumont</a>), <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/84">cross-compilation</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/EduardoRFS">EduardoRFS</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/78">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/81">bug</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/83">fixes</a>, even <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/95">memory leak</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/talex5">talex5</a> for reporting several of these issues), and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/99">RSA</a> <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-crypto/pull/100">interoperability</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/psafont">psafont</a> for investigation and <a href="https://github.com/mattjbray">mattjbray</a> for reporting). This library feels very mature now - being used by multiple stakeholders, and lots of issues have been fixed in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="Qubes-Firewall">Qubes Firewall</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/">MirageOS based Qubes firewall</a> is the most widely used MirageOS unikernel. And it got major updates: in May <a href="https://github.com/linse">Steffi</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/qubes-users/c/Xzplmkjwa5Y">announced</a> her and <a href="https://github.com/yomimono">Mindy's</a> work on improving it for Qubes 4.0 - including <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vm-interface/#firewall-rules-in-4x">dynamic firewall rules via QubesDB</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://prototypefund.de/project/portable-firewall-fuer-qubesos/">prototypefund</a> for sponsoring.</p>
<p>In October 2020, we released <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-39-release">Mirage 3.9</a> with PVH virtualization mode (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mato">mato</a>). There's still a <a href="https://github.com/mirage/qubes-mirage-firewall/issues/120">memory leak</a> to be investigated and fixed.</p>
<h3 id="IPv6">IPv6</h3>

<p>In December, with <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-310-release">Mirage 3.10</a> we got the IPv6 code up and running. Now MirageOS unikernels have a dual stack available, besides IPv4-only and IPv6-only network stacks. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nojb">nojb</a> for the initial code and <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS">MagnusS</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out this blog, but also robur services, are now available via IPv6 :)</p>
<h3 id="Albatross">Albatross</h3>

<p>Also in December, I pushed an initial release of <a href="https://github.com/roburio/albatross">albatross</a>, a unikernel orchestration system with remote access. <em>Deploy your unikernel via a TLS handshake -- the unikernel image is embedded in the TLS client certificates.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/reynir">reynir</a> for statistics support on Linux and improvements of the systemd service scripts. Also thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cfcs">cfcs</a> for the initial Linux port.</p>
<h3 id="CA-certs">CA certs</h3>

<p>For several years I postponed the problem of how to actually use the operating system trust anchors for OCaml-TLS connections. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/emillon">emillon</a> for initial code, there are now <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs">ca-certs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ca-certs-nss">ca-certs-nss</a> opam packages (see <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-ca-certs-and-ca-certs-nss">release announcement</a>) which fills this gap.</p>
<h2 id="Unikernels">Unikernels</h2>

<p>I developed several useful unikernels in 2020, and also pushed <a href="https://mirage.io/wiki/gallery">a unikernel gallery</a> to the Mirage website:</p>
<h3 id="Traceroute-in-MirageOS">Traceroute in MirageOS</h3>

<p>I already wrote about <a href="https://hannes.robur.coop/Posts/Traceroute">traceroute</a> which traces the routing to a given remote host.</p>
<h3 id="Unipi-static-website-hosting">Unipi - static website hosting</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/roburio/unipi">Unipi</a> is a static site webserver which retrieves the content from a remote git repository. Let's encrypt certificate provisioning and dynamic updates via a webhook to be executed for every push.</p>
<h4 id="TLSTunnel-TLS-demultiplexing">TLSTunnel - TLS demultiplexing</h4>

<p>The physical machine this blog and other robur infrastructure runs on has been relocated from Sweden to Germany mid-December. Thanks to UPS! Fewer IPv4 addresses are available in the new data center, which motivated me to develop <a href="https://github.com/roburio/tlstunnel">tlstunnel</a>.</p>
<p>The new behaviour is as follows (see the <code>monitoring</code> branch):</p>
<ul><li>listener on TCP port 80 which replies with a permanent redirect to <code>https</code></li><li>listener on TCP port 443 which forwards to a backend host if the requested server name is configured</li><li>its configuration is stored on a block device, and can be dynamically changed (with a custom protocol authenticated with a HMAC)</li><li>it is setup to hold a wildcard TLS certificate and in DNS a wildcard entry is pointing to it</li><li>setting up a new service is very straightforward: only the new name needs to be registered with tlstunnel together with the TCP backend, and everything will just work</li></ul>

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>

<p>The year started with a release of <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-first-release-of-awa-ssh">awa</a>, a SSH implementation in OCaml (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haesbaert">haesbaert</a> for initial code). This was followed by a <a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-release-of-ocaml-git-v3-0-duff-encore-decompress-etc/">git 3.0 release</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure">dinosaure</a>).</p>
<h3 id="Deploying-MirageOS-NGI-Pointer">Deploying MirageOS - NGI Pointer</h3>

<p>For 2021 we at robur received funding from the EU (via <a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI pointer</a>) for "Deploying MirageOS", which boils down into three parts:</p>
<ul><li>reproducible binary releases of MirageOS unikernels,</li><li>monitoring (and other devops features: profiling) and integration into existing infrastructure,</li><li>and further documentation and advertisement.</li></ul>

<p>Of course this will all be available open source. Please get in touch via eMail (team aT robur dot coop) if you're eager to integrate MirageOS unikernels into your infrastructure.</p>
<p>We discovered at an initial meeting with an infrastructure provider that a DNS resolver is of interest - even more now that dnsmasq suffered from <a href="https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DNSpooq_Technical-Whitepaper.pdf">dnspooq</a>. We are already working on an <a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/pull/251">implementation of DNSSec</a>.</p>
<p>MirageOS unikernels are binary reproducible, and <a href="https://github.com/rjbou/orb/pull/1">infrastructure tools are available</a>. We are working hard on a web interface (and REST API - think of it as "Docker Hub for MirageOS unikernels"), and more tooling to verify reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="Conex-securing-the-supply-chain">Conex - securing the supply chain</h3>

<p>Another funding from the <a href="http://ocaml-sf.org/">OCSF</a> is to continue development and deploy <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/conex">conex</a> - to bring trust into opam-repository. This is a great combination with the reproducible build efforts, and will bring much more trust into retrieving OCaml packages and using MirageOS unikernels.</p>
<h3 id="MirageOS-4-0">MirageOS 4.0</h3>

<p>Mirage so far still uses ocamlbuild and ocamlfind for compiling the virtual machine binary. But the switch to dune is <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/1195">close</a>, a lot of effort has been done. This will make the developer experience of MirageOS much more smooth, with a per-unikernel monorepo workflow where you can push your changes to the individual libraries.</p>


<p>If you want to support our work on MirageOS unikernels, please <a href="https://robur.coop/Donate">donate to robur</a>. I'm interested in feedback, either via <a href="https://twitter.com/h4nnes">twitter</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hannesm">hannesm@mastodon.social</a> or an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/hannesm/hannes.nqsb.io/issues">data repository</a>.</p>

<p>Concurrent invocations of the member functions of a <code>std::latch</code> or a <code>std::barrier</code> are no data race. A data race is such a crucial term in concurrency that I want to write more words to it.</p>

<p>A data race is a situation, in which at least two threads access a shared variable at the same time and at least one thread tries to modify the variable.

<p>100 threads adding 50 euros to the same account (1) using the function <code>addMoney</code> (2). The initial account is 100 (3). The crucial observation is that the writing to the account is done without synchronization. Therefore&nbsp;we have a data race and, consequently, undefined behavior. The final balance is between 5000 and 5100 euro (4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/addMoney.png" alt="addMoney"></p>
<p>What is happening? Why are a few additions missing? The update process <code>to.balance <span>+=</span> amount; </code>in line (1) is a so-called read-modify-write operation. As such, first, the old value of <code>to.balance</code> is read, then it is updated, and finally is written. What may happen under the hood is the following. I use numbers to make my argumentation more obvious</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread A reads the value 500 euro and then Thread B kicks in.</li>
<li>Thread B read also the value 500 euro, adds 50 euro to it, and updates <code>to.balance</code> to 550 euro.</li>
<li>Now Thread A finished its execution by adding 50 euro to <code>to.balance</code> and also writes 550 euro.</li>
<li>Essential the value 550 euro is written twice and instead of two additions of 50 euro, we only observe one.</li>
<li>This means, that one modification is lost and we get the wrong final sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, there are two questions to answer before I present <code>std::latch</code> and <code>std::barrier</code> in detail.</p>
<h2 id="h2-two-questions">Two Questions<code><br></code></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the difference between these two mechanisms to coordinate threads?</strong> You can use a <code>std::latch</code> only once, but you can use a <code>std::barrier</code> more than once. A <code>std::latch</code> is useful for managing one task by multiple threads; a<code> std::barrier</code> is helpful for managing repeated tasks by multiple threads. Additionally, a <code>std::barrier</code> enables you to execute a function in the so-called completion step. The completion step is the state when the counter becomes zero.</li>
<li><strong>What use cases do latches and barriers support that cannot be done in C++11 with futures, threads, or condition variables combined with locks?</strong> Latches and barriers address no new use cases, but they are a lot easier to use. They are also more performant because they often use a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm">lock-free </a>mechanism internally.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me continue my post with the simpler data type of both.</p>
<h2 id="h3-std-latch"><code>std::latch</code></h2>
<p>Now, let us have a closer look at the interface of a <code>std::latch</code>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/memberFunctionsLatch.png" alt="memberFunctionsLatch" width="600" height="161"></p>
<p>The default value for <code>upd</code> is <code>1</code>. When <code>upd</code> is greater than the counter or negative, the behavior is undefined. The call <code>lat.try_wait()</code> does never wait as its name suggests.</p>
<p>The following program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code> uses two <code>std::latch</code> to build a boss-workers workflow. I synchronized the output to <code>std::cout</code> using the function <code>synchronizedOut</code> (1). This synchronization makes it easier to follow the workflow.</p>

<p>The idea of the workflow is straightforward. The six workers <code>herb</code>, <code>scott</code>, <code>bjarne</code>, <code>andrei</code>, <code>andrew</code>, and <code>david</code> in the <code>main</code>-program have to fulfill their job. When they finished their job, they count down the <code>std::latch workDone</code> (2). The boss (<code>main</code>-thread) is blocked in line (3) until the counter becomes 0. When the counter is 0, the boss uses the second <code>std::latch goHome</code> to signal its workers to go home. In this case, the initial counter is <code>1</code> (4). The call g<code>oHome.wait</code> (5) blocks until the counter becomes 0.</p>
<p><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/bossWorkers.png" alt="bossWorkers" width="300" height="314"></p>
<p>When you think about this workflow, you may notice that it can be performed without a boss. Here is the modern variant:</p>

<div>
<pre><span>// workers.cpp</span>

<span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;latch&gt;</span>
<span>#include &lt;mutex&gt;</span>

std<span>::</span>mutex coutMutex;

    std<span>::</span>lock_guard<span>&lt;</span>std<span>::</span>mutex<span>&gt;</span> lo(coutMutex);
    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> s;
}

<span>class</span> <span>Worker</span> {
 <span>public:</span>
    Worker(std<span>::</span>string n)<span>:</span> name(n) { };
  
    <span>void</span> <span>operator</span>() () {
        synchronizedOut(name <span>+</span> <span>": "</span> <span>+</span> <span>"Work done!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
        workDone.arrive_and_wait();  <span>// wait until all work is done  (1)</span>
        synchronizedOut(name <span>+</span> <span>": "</span> <span>+</span> <span>"See you tomorrow!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
    }
 <span>private:</span>
    std<span>::</span>string name;
};

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>() {

    std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>'\n'</span>;

    Worker herb(<span>"  Herb"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> herbWork(herb);
  
    Worker scott(<span>"    Scott"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> scottWork(scott);
  
    Worker bjarne(<span>"      Bjarne"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> bjarneWork(bjarne);
  
    Worker andrei(<span>"        Andrei"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> andreiWork(andrei);
  
    Worker andrew(<span>"          Andrew"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> andrewWork(andrew);
  
    Worker david(<span>"            David"</span>);
    std<span>::</span><span>thread</span> davidWork(david);

    herbWork.join();
    scottWork.join();
    bjarneWork.join();
    andreiWork.join();
    andrewWork.join();
    davidWork.join();
  
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>There is not much to add to this simplified workflow. The call <code>workDone.arrive_and_wait(1)</code> (1) is equivalent to the calls <code>count_down(upd); wait();</code>. This means the workers coordinate themself and the boss is no longer necessary such as in the previous program <code>bossWorkers.cpp</code>.</p>
<h2><img src="http://modernescpp.com/images/blog/Cpp20/LatchesAndBarriers/workers.png" alt="workers"></h2>
<h2 id="h4-what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>A <code>std::barrier </code>is quite similar to a <code>std::latch</code>. <code>std::barrier</code>'s strength is it to perform a job more than once. In my next post, I will have a closer look at barriers.</p>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>

<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>

<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>
<p>The source code is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A printed photo in an album can easily last 20+ years without deterioration.</p>
<p>Digital files are another story altogether: computers fail, hard drives crash,
and CDROMs deteriorate.</p>
<p>Reliably and robustly storing digital files used to require an IT staff and rack
of expensive hardware. Recent innovations have made this affordable and easy to
do, even for non-nerds.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR: Make sure you have <strong>multiple copies</strong>, on <strong>separate hardware</strong>, and
preferably <strong>at least one</strong> copy offsite. Newer filesystems available on NAS
devices can provide additional data integrity safeguards. And remember, <a href="https://photostructure.com/faq/raid-is-not-a-backup/">RAID
doesn’t count</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-old-axiom-3-2-1-backups">The old axiom: “3-2-1 backups”<a href="#the-old-axiom-3-2-1-backups" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>The “3-2-1” backup strategy from several decades ago was one of the more common
strategies for keeping files safe.</p>
<p>This strategy requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>at last <strong>three</strong> different copies of every file, with</li>
<li>at least <strong>two</strong> different <em>storage formats</em>, and</li>
<li>at least <strong>one</strong> copy offsite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, though, you can do better.</p>
<h2 id="why-different-storage-formats">Why different storage formats?<a href="#why-different-storage-formats" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>If you store your data on different formats, the hope is that the different
formats will have different lifespans. When one copy fails before the other, it
gives you time to make a new copy.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this line of reasoning, though.</p>

<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/dvd.jpg" alt="Optical media"> <figcaption>

</figure>
<p>The first issue is that storage formats available to consumers are typically
only hard drives and optical storage media (CD-R, DVD-R, or BD-R). The latest
optical storage technology (as of July, 2020), is quad-layer blue ray which can
store 100GB per disk. External hard drives are regularly in the 6-12TB range,
which are <strong>60-120x larger</strong>. Backing up a $150 12TB hard drive on optical media
would be ridiculously herculean and expensive: it would take 120 BD-R disks, and
$1,400 in media, using $12 M-Discs.</p>
<h2 id="why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-data-integrity">Why 3-2-1 isn’t enough: data integrity<a href="#why-3-2-1-isnt-enough-data-integrity" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>All commonly available storage formats eventually suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">data
degradation</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption">corruption</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CD-R’s with organic dyes may only last a couple years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">Solid-state drives</a>, or SSD,
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/solid-state-disks-lose-data-if-left-without-power-for-just-a-few-days/">lose data integrity when unplugged in as little as a
year</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SD cards, when left unplugged, experience “cell voltage drift,” and lose integrity in 5-7 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">Hard disk drives</a>, commonly
called HDD or “spinning rust”, have <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html">substantial failure rates after 4-6 years
of continuous
service</a>. Even when
kept offline, HDD data integrity will degrade after 5-10 years due to
demagnetization of the iron oxide substrate, or servo and platter motor
failures. (Feel fortunate if your decade-old external drive still spins up!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data integrity is the big issue that “3-2-1 backups” doesn’t address: <strong>even if
you’ve got several copies of your data, how do you know that each copy hasn’t
suffered from data degradation?</strong></p>
<h2 id="an-example-of-data-degradation">An example of data degradation<a href="#an-example-of-data-degradation" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Your photos and videos are comprised of hundreds of thousands, millions or even
tens of millions of bits of data.</p>
<p>If a handful of those bits are “flipped” due to storage defects or media
degradation your file can become unreadable.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an image with only a couple bits flipped:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://photostructure.com/img/2020/06/bitrot.jpg" alt="JPEG bit rot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (source)"> <figcaption>
<p>JPEG bit rot after flipping 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation">source</a>)</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the rightmost image contents are 99.999% correct, yet isn’t viewable.</p>
<h2 id="error-correction-codes">Error correction codes<a href="#error-correction-codes" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Hard drives and optical disks use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code">error correction
codes</a> to provide some
amount of resiliency to bit rot. Typical ECC allows for several bits in a file
to flip, be detected, and be automatically repaired.</p>
<p>ECC can only detect and repair a specific rate of bit rot, however. Data
degradation in older storage media may exceed this rate.</p>
<h2 id="treating-the-symptom">Treating the symptom<a href="#treating-the-symptom" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>In developing PhotoStructure, we found that many of our photos on older hard
drives had succumbed to some amount of bit rot. We taught PhotoStructure how to
detect and skip over photos and videos that are corrupt, in the hope that you’ll
have several copies of a given photo, and one of them won’t have bit rot.</p>
<p>But this feature just treats the symptom: this doesn’t fix the underlying
problem.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-bit-rot">Overcoming bit rot<a href="#overcoming-bit-rot" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p>Several advanced filesystems, including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">btrfs</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>, support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data
scrubbing</a>, which detects and
repairs bit rot automatically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither Windows nor macOS support these filesystems (and their
newer filesystems, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a>,
still don’t detect bit rot). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)">Time
Machine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_and_Restore">Backup and
Restore</a> don’t detect bit rot
either.</p>
<p>So: <em>how do normal people use these fancy new filesystems?</em></p>
<h2 id="nas-to-the-rescue">NAS to the rescue<a href="#nas-to-the-rescue" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached
storage</a> (NAS) devices
hold several large hard drives and quietly do their work safely storing your
files. You can keep using your favorite OS, but you don’t have to worry about
bit rot anymore.</p>
<p>Most NAS also support Docker, which is a way of packaging and running
third-party applications, like PhotoStructure.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/series/home">Synology</a> is the easiest
and most “plug and play” of these solutions. Be sure to get a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Storage/Which_Synology_NAS_models_support_the_Btrfs_file_system">newer NAS that
supports
btrfs</a>.</p>
<p>Synology’s proprietary hardware comes at a bit of a cost premium than if you
built it yourself, and docker support via their UI is a bit limited (which can
be overcome by using a tool like <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://unraid.net/">Unraid OS</a> runs on hardware you already
have, supports XFS and btrfs, has great docker support, but requires a
commercial license to use. It’s very flexible in adding and removing drives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/">TrueNAS CORE</a> (previously “FreeNAS”) is
free and fairly easy to install. It uses ZFS, and supports a wide variety of
hardware. If building a computer is intimidating and you’d like to try
TrueNAS CORE, the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/truenas-mini/">TrueNAS Mini</a> comes
pre-assembled.</p>
<p>Note that expanding existing volumes by adding additional disks (which is
simple on Synology and Unraid) is <em>not fun</em> on FreeNAS, due to limitations in
ZFS. FreeNAS natively uses FreeBSD jails, which are technically excellent but
decidedly less popular than Docker. More recent versions of FreeNAS have added
docker support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.snapraid.it/">SnapRAID</a> is different from these other
alternatives, in that it’s not an operating system nor a filesystem: it’s an
open-source application that runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>SnapRAID is the only non-realtime data integrity product here: it must be run
periodically to build snapshots or check and repair data integrity errors.
SnapRAID requires command-line expertise and manual setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(PhotoStructure has no commercial affiliation with any of these products. We’d
caution against cheaper NAS brands, however, as lax security updates may lead to
malware infections and data loss.)</em></p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-your-nas">Getting started with your NAS<a href="#getting-started-with-your-nas" arialabel="Anchor"> #</a> </h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider getting a NAS that supports 4 or more drives. More slots for more
drives gives you a lot more flexibility in the future, should your data
exceed your original drives. If you’re building a box to run Unraid,
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/">Fractal</a> makes some nice cases: the new
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-7/black/">Define
7</a> and
<a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/meshify/meshify-2/black/">Meshify
2</a>
support 12+ HDDs (!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy 50% more storage than you need right now so you have room to grow in the
near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable weekly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing">data scrubbing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_%28computer_storage%29#File_systems">snapshotting</a>,

</li>
<li>
<p>Enable monthly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.#Self-tests">S.M.A.R.T. self-tests</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up your NAS to either apply security patches automatically or notify you
to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider installing a virus scanner and malware detection package on your
NAS. Synology has a “security audit” tool as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your router has recently-updated firmware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use secure admin and user passwords. Enable 2FA if available. Using a
password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> makes this easy to
do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your NAS to tell you if it has any errors: <strong>you don’t want any
disks dying or backups failing without you knowing it.</strong></p>
</li>

<p>Please understand: <a href="https://photostructure.com/faq/raid-is-not-a-backup"><strong>RAID is not a backup</strong></a>. Please
read that post before continuing.</p>
<p>Satisfy the 2nd or 3rd copy of the “at least 3 copies” rule by copying the
entire contents of your NAS to an external hard drive that normally stays
powered down and offline. Do this quarterly.</p>
<p>Consider storing this drive near your emergency kit so you can grab it as you
leave your house in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>This external drive can also reduce your dataloss if your NAS catastrophically
fails, or if you get hit by malware like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker">cryptolockers</a>.</p>

<p>Satisfy the “at least 1 offsite” rule by setting up your NAS to back up to a
cloud service automatically. <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze</a> and
<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a> are both well-regarded offsite storage
solutions, and both have solutions that work with your new NAS.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to pay for cloud storage, you can set up another NAS (like at
a friend or family member’s house). Both FreeNAS and Synology support NAS-to-NAS
replication.</p>
<p>Make sure you configure the replication job to run in the middle of the night,
and throttle network bandwidth so you don’t make your friends or family grumpy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
