<p>For the first time, after a seven-year build, UKAEA’s £55M-machine, labelled <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/mast-upgrade/">Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) Upgrade</a>, has achieved “first plasma” – where all the essential components work together simultaneously.</p>
<p>The project at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy was funded by the Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research &amp; Innovation and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>Fusion energy offers the potential of an abundant, inherently safe low-carbon electricity supply (the raw materials are found in seawater and the Earth’s crust). It involves fusing hydrogen particles in a hot gas known as a ‘plasma’ to unlock large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Operating fusion technologies requires a careful balancing act of controlling extreme heat, gas and powerful magnetic fields, amongst other complex systems.</p>
<h3>Super-X factor</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in fusion research has been to extract the amount of excess heat from the plasma. UKAEA’s scientists now plan to test a new exhaust system called the ‘Super-X divertor’ at MAST Upgrade.</p>
<p>This system is designed to channel plasma out of the machine at temperatures low enough for its materials to withstand – meaning that components can last much longer. The approximate tenfold reduction in heat arriving at the internal surfaces of the machine has the potential to be a game-changer for the long-term viability of future fusion power stations.</p>
<h3>A step towards fusion power</h3>
<p>MAST Upgrade will be the forerunner of the UK’s prototype fusion power plant, <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/">Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (“STEP”)</a>, due for completion by 2040.</p>
<p>STEP – which UKAEA is designing in an initial £220 million programme funded by the UK Government – will be based on MAST Upgrade’s ‘spherical tokamak’ fusion concept. The spherical tokamak could offer a route to a compact fusion power plant. The success of MAST Upgrade is another step along the way to designing future fusion power facilities, which could have an important role as part of a future portfolio of low-carbon energy.</p>
<p>MAST Upgrade will also aid preparations for <a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITER</a> – the world’s largest science megaproject, now being built in the South of France, which intends to demonstrate fusion power on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>UK Science Minister, Amanda Solloway, said: “We want the UK to be a world leader in fusion energy and to capitalise on its amazing potential as a clean energy source that could last for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Backed by £55 million of government funding, powering up the MAST Upgrade device is a landmark moment for this national fusion experiment and takes us another step closer towards our goal of building the UK’s first fusion power plant by 2040.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the achievement of first plasma, UKAEA CEO, Professor Ian Chapman, said:</p>
<p>“MAST Upgrade will take us closer to delivering sustainable, clean fusion energy. This experiment will break new ground and test technology that has never been tried before. It ensures the UK is in the premier league of countries working on fusion – and will be vital in achieving UKAEA’s goal of building the STEP fusion power plant.”</p>

<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>This summer I’ve been interning at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, and have been writing a lot of Go. It’s been a bit of a change coming from a Haskell background, so I decided to write up my thoughts now, at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="incredibly-easy-to-pick-up">Incredibly easy to pick up</h3>
<p>There’s not a lot to Go, it’s quite a small language. I had never written a line of it before June, and now I’ve written about 30,000. It’s very easy to get started and become productive.</p>
<p>Haskell, on the other hand, is notorious for being hard to learn (<em>cough</em> monad tutorials <em>cough</em>). People often find it really hard to take the step from evaluating pure mathematical expressions to writing actual programs. I experienced no such disconnect in Go.</p>
<h3 id="garbage-collector-keeps-getting-better-and-better">Garbage collector keeps getting better and better</h3>
<p>Pusher previously tried to use Haskell for the project I was working on, but eventually had to give up due to unpredictable latency caused by garbage collection pauses. GHC’s garbage collector is <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/">designed for throughput, not latency</a>. It is a generational copying collector, which means that pause times are proportional to the amount of live data in the heap. To make matters worse, it’s also stop-the-world.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/go15gc">Go’s garbage collector</a> is a concurrent mark-sweep with very short stop-the-world pauses, and it just seems to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#performance">keep getting better</a>. This is definitely a good thing for a garbage collected language. We did have some issues with unacceptable latencies, but were able to work them all out. No such luck with the Haskell project.</p>
<h3 id="style-wars-are-a-thing-of-the-past">Style wars are a thing of the past</h3>
<p>Say what you like about <code>gofmt</code>, but it makes arguments over code style almost impossible. Just run it on save, and your code will always be consistently formatted.</p>
<p>I do find it a little strange that <code>gofmt</code> has been completely accepted, whereas Python’s significant whitespace (which is there for exactly the same reason: enforcing readable code) has been much more contentious across the programming community.</p>
<h2 id="the-neutral">The Neutral</h2>
<h3 id="code-generation-seems-to-be-the-accepted-solution-to-a-lot-of-problems">Code generation seems to be the accepted solution to a lot of problems</h3>
<p>I am not a huge fan of code generation (and I say this as <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/go-interface-fuzzer/">the author of a code generation tool</a>). I think it can do good, but it can also obscure what’s actually going on. In every discussion on Go generics, someone will come along and say you can add generics with code generation: that’s true, but at the cost of introducing additional, nonstandard, syntax.</p>
<p>I suspect the strong culture of code generation is largely because it lets you work around the flaws of the language.</p>
<h3 id="strict-not-lazy-evaluation">Strict, not lazy, evaluation</h3>
<p>Strict evaluation is typically better for performance than lazy evaluation (thunks cause allocation, so you’re gambling that <a href="https://www.barrucadu.co.uk/posts/2016-02-12-strict-vs-lazy.html">the computation saved offsets the memory cost</a>), but it does make things less composable. There have been a couple of times where I’ve gone to split up a function, only to realise that doing so would require allocating a data structure in memory which before was not needed.</p>
<p>I could trust the compiler to inline things for me, and so optimise away the additional allocations, but in a lazy language you just don’t have that issue at all.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-library-is-not-so-great">The standard library is not so great</h3>
<p>If you know me in person, it might seem a little odd that I specifically comment on this. Normally I am all for languages having a small, really well-written, stdlib and everything else provided through libraries. I am picking on Go here a bit because the standard library seems to get a lot of praise, but I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>Parts of it are good, a lot of it is mediocre, and some of it is downright bad (like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">go/ast</a> package documentation). It seems a lot of Go’s use is in webdev, so perhaps those bits of the stdlib (which I haven’t touched at all) are consistently good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>I also agree with this Quora answer by Tikhon Jelvis to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-that-golang-is-ugly">do you feel that golang is ugly?</a>, so have a look at that once you’ve read this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-culture-of-backwards-compatibility-at-all-costs">A culture of “backwards compatibility at all costs”</h3>
<p>In Go, you import packages by URL. If the URL points to, say, GitHub, then <code>go get</code> downloads HEAD of master and uses that. There is no way to specify a version, unless you have separate URLs for each version of your library.</p>
<p>This is just insane.</p>
<p>Go has a very strong culture of backwards compatibility, which I think is largely due to this. Even if you have a flaw in the API of your library, you can’t actually <em>fix</em> it because that would break all of your reverse-dependencies, unless they do vendoring, or pin to a specific commit.</p>
<p>Coming from the Haskell world, where the attitude is far more towards correctness than compatibility, this was probably the biggest culture shock for me. Things break backwards compatibility in Haskell, and the users just update their code because they <em>know</em> the library author did it for a reason. In Go, it just doesn’t happen <em>at all</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-system-is-really-weak">The type system is really weak</h3>
<p>A common mantra in Haskell is “make illegal states unrepresentable,” which is great. If you’ve never come across it before it means to <em>choose your types such that an illegal value is a static error</em>. Want to avoid nulls? Use an option type. Want to ensure a list has at least one element? Use a nonempty list type. Use proper enums, not just ints. etc etc</p>
<p>In Go you just can’t do that, the type system isn’t strong enough. So a lot of things which are (or can be) a <em>compile-time</em> error in Haskell are a <em>runtime</em> error in Go, which is just worse.</p>
<p>Let’s pick on some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No generics</strong></p>
<p>Want to write a tree where every element is statically <em>guaranteed</em> to be the same type? Well, have fun implementing a “uinttree”, an “inttree”, a “stringtree”, and so on. You can’t just implement a generic tree.</p>
<p>But Go <em>does</em> have generics, for the built-in types. Arrays, channels, maps, and slices all have generic type parameters. So it seems that the Go developers want generics, but they don’t want to bother implementing it properly, so it remains a special case for a few things in the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No sum types</strong></p>
<p>The way in Go to handle possibly-failing functions is to have multiple return values: an actual result, and an error. If the error is <code>nil</code>, then the actual result is sensible; otherwise the actual result is meaningless.</p>
<p>This means you can forget to check the error and use a bogus result and, because there are no compiler warnings (another wtf), you will know nothing of this until things fail at runtime.</p>
<p>With a sum type, like <code>Either error result</code>, that just can’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No separation of pure code from effectful code</strong></p>
<p>It is very nice to know, just by looking at the type of a function, that it <em>cannot</em> perform any side-effects. Go’s type system doesn’t do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-tooling-is-bad">The tooling is bad</h3>
<p>Haskell gets a lot of criticism for bad tooling, but I think it’s worlds ahead of Go in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Godoc makes it really difficult to write good documentation</strong></p>
<p>Godoc groups bindings by type, and then sorts alphabetically. Code is not written like that, code is written with related functions in proximity to each other. The source order is <em>almost always</em> better than how godoc sorts things.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7873">godoc doesn’t even support lists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous proposals similar to this have been rejected on grounds that it’s a slippery slope from this to Markdown or worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that comment is particularly discouraging. Because the developers don’t like Markdown (and similar languages), they refuse to add even the most basic of formatting to godoc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is nothing like GHC’s heap profiling</strong></p>
<p>Go has a snapshot-based memory profiler. You can take a snapshot at a point in time, and see which functions and types are taking up the heap space. However, there is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#profiling-memory-usage">nothing like this</a>.</p>
<p>Being able to see not only a snapshot, but also how things have changed over time, is incredibly useful for spotting memory leaks. If all you have is a snapshot, all you can really say is “well, the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s looks a bit high, is that right?” With a graph you can say “the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s is increasing when it shouldn’t be.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is (was?) nothing like ThreadScope</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope">ThreadScope</a> is a tool for profiling performance of concurrent Haskell programs. It shows which Haskell threads are running on which OS threads, when garbage collection happens, and a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>If things are slower than expected, it’s great: you can see <em>exactly</em> how things are executing. Go doesn’t <em>currently</em> have anything like it, although towards the end of Dave Cheney’s <strong>Seven ways to profile Go applications</strong> talk at <a href="http://golanguk.com/">GolangUK</a>, he did whip out something which looked rather like ThreadScope (sadly, a video isn’t up at the time of writing, that I can see).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-values-are-almost-never-what-you-want">Zero values are almost never what you want</h3>
<p>Go avoids the issue of uninitialised memory by having “zero values”. If you declare a variable of type <code>int</code>, but don’t give it a value, it gets the value 0. Simple.</p>
<p>Except that that’s almost never what you want.</p>
<p>What is a sensible default value for a type? Well, it depends on what you’re using it for! Sometimes there isn’t a sensible default, and not initialising a value should be an error. You can’t define a zero value for your own types, so you’re kind of stuck.</p>
<p>Zero values caused so many problems over the summer, because everything would <em>appear</em> to be fine, then it suddenly breaks because the zero value wasn’t sensible for its context of use. Perhaps it’s an unrelated change that causes things to break (like a struct getting an extra field).</p>
<p>I would much rather:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the syntax for declaring a variable without giving it a value.</li>
<li>Make it an error to not initialise a struct field.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lots-of-boilerplate">Lots of boilerplate</h3>
<p>The cause of the lots of code generation, I feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because you have to check error values, if you want to perform a sequence of possibly-erroring computations, where the successful result of one feeds into the next, there is a lot of typing. In Haskell, you’d just use the <code>Either</code> monad.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to sort a slice, because there are no generics, you need to wrap the slice in another type and implement three methods on that type. So that’s four lines of code to sort a slice of uints, four lines to sort a slice of uint8s, …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>

  </div><div><p>A little over a month after releasing Bevy 0.2, and thanks to <strong>59</strong> contributors, <strong>122</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="initial-android-support">Initial Android Support</h2>

<p>You can try out the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples/android">Bevy Android example</a> by following the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/examples/README.md#android">instructions here</a>. While many things work, please note that this is <em>very hot</em> off the presses. Some features will work and others probably won't. Now is a great time to dive in and help us close the gaps!</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/android.png" alt="android"></p>
<p>This was a massive group effort that spanned multiple projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bevy: rewrote bevy-glsl-to-spirv to support android / static libraries (@PrototypeNM1, @enfipy)</li>
<li>Bevy: <code>bevy_asset</code> backend using Android Asset Manager (@enfipy)</li>
<li>Bevy: Touch support (@naithar)</li>
<li>Bevy: Texture format fix (@enfipy)</li>
<li>Bevy: UI touch fixes, touch force, and android example (@enfipy)</li>
<li>Cpal: android audio support (@endragor) </li>
<li>android-ndk-rs / cargo-apk: fix to support Bevy project structure (@PrototypeNM1)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-ios-support">Initial iOS Support</h2>
<p>authors: @simlay, @MichaelHills, @Dash-L, @naithar</p>
<p>Bevy can now run on iOS!</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/ios.png"></p><p>You can try out the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples/ios">Bevy iOS example</a> by following the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples#ios">instructions here</a>. This one is also hot off the presses: some features will work and others probably won't.</p>
<p>This was another large group effort that spanned multiple projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bevy: XCode Project / Example (@simlay with help from @MichaelHills)</li>
<li>Bevy: Runtime shader compilation using shaderc (@MichaelHills)</li>
<li>Bevy: Rodio upgrade (@Dash-L)</li>
<li>Bevy: Touch support (@naithar)</li>
<li>Winit: Fix iOS portrait view (@MichaelHills) </li>
<li>RustAudio: iOS support (@simlay and @MichaelHills)</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal/pull/485">Audio doesn't quite work yet</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wasm-asset-loading">WASM Asset Loading</h2>
<p>authors: @mrk-its (and ported to the new AssetIo by @cart)</p>
<p>@mrk-its has been hard at work on expanding Bevy's WASM support. In this release we landed WASM asset loading. You can now load assets when you publish to WASM just like you would on any other platform:</p>
<pre><code><span>asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>sprite.png</span><span>");
</span></code></pre>
<p>If the asset hasn't already been loaded, this will make a <code>fetch()</code> request to retrieve the asset over HTTP.</p>
<p>@mrk-its has also been building a custom WebGL2 <code>bevy_render</code> backend. It is already pretty usable, but its not <em>quite</em> ready yet. Expect more news on this soon!</p>
<h2 id="touch-input">Touch Input</h2>
<p>authors: @naithar</p>
<p>Bevy now has support for touches:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>touch_system</span><span>(</span><span>touches</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Touches</span><span>&gt;) {
    </span><span>// you can iterate all current touches and retrieve their state like this:
    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
        </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>active touch: {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> touch</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter_just_pressed</span><span>() {
        </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>just pressed {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> touch</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter_just_released</span><span>() {

<h3 id="asset-handle-reference-counting">Asset Handle Reference Counting</h3>
<p>Assets are now automatically freed when their "handle reference count" reaches zero. This means you no longer need to think about freeing assets manually:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Calling load() now returns a strong handle:
</span><span>let</span><span> handle </span><span>=</span><span> asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>sprite.png</span><span>");

</span><span>// Note that you no longer need to unwrap() loaded handles. Ergonomics for the win!

// Cloning a handle increases the reference count by one
</span><span>let</span><span> second_handle </span><span>=</span><span> handle</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>();

</span><span>// Spawn a sprite and give it our handle
</span><span>commands</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>SpriteComponents </span><span>{
</span><span>    material</span><span>:</span><span> materials</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>handle</span><span>.</span><span>into</span><span>()),
    ..</span><span>Default</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>()
});

</span><span>// Later in some other system:
</span><span>commands</span><span>.</span><span>despawn</span><span>(</span><span>sprite_entity</span><span>);

</span><span>// There are no more active handles to "sprite.png", so it will be freed before the next update
</span></code></pre><h3 id="asset-loaders-can-now-load-multiple-assets">Asset Loaders can now load multiple assets</h3>
<p>In past releases, <code>AssetLoaders</code> could only produce a single asset of a single type. In <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong>, they can now produce any number of assets for any type. The old behavior was extremely limiting when loading assets like GLTF files, which might produce many meshes, textures, and scenes. </p>
<h3 id="sub-asset-loading">Sub-Asset Loading</h3>
<p>Sometimes you only want to load a specific asset from an asset source. You can now load sub assets like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Mesh0/Primitive0 references the first mesh primitive in "my_scene.gltf"
</span><span>let</span><span> mesh </span><span>=</span><span> asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>my_scene.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0</span><span>");
</span></code></pre><h3 id="assetio-trait">AssetIo Trait</h3>
<p>The <code>AssetServer</code> is now backed by the <code>AssetIo</code> trait. This allows us to load assets from whatever storage we want. This means on desktop we now load from the filesystem, on Android we use the Android Asset Manager, and on the web we make HTTP requests using the <code>fetch()</code> api.</p>
<h3 id="asset-dependencies">Asset Dependencies</h3>
<p>Assets can now depend on other assets, which will automatically be loaded when the original asset is loaded. This is useful when loading something like a "scene" which might reference other asset sources. We utilize this in our new GLTF loader.</p>
<h3 id="removed-assetserver-load-sync">Removed AssetServer::load_sync()</h3>
<p>This might rustle some feathers, but <code>AssetServer::load_sync()</code> had to go! This api wasn't WASM friendly, encouraged users to block game execution for the sake of convenience (which causes "hitching"), and was incompatible with the new AssetLoader api. Asset loading is now always asynchronous. Users of <code>load_sync()</code> should instead <code>load()</code> their assets, check load status in their systems, and change game state accordingly. </p>
<h2 id="gltf-scene-loader">GLTF Scene Loader</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>Up until this point, the GLTF loader was painfully limited. It could only load the first mesh with a single texture in a GLTF file. For <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong>, we took advantage of the asset system improvements to write a new <code>GltfLoader</code> that loads GLTF files as Bevy <code>Scenes</code>, along with all meshes and textures in the files.</p>
<p>Here's Bevy loading the Khronos Flight Helmet example, which consists of multiple meshes and textures!</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/flight_helmet.png" alt="flight helmet"></p>
<p>Here is the complete code for a system that loads a GLTF file and spawns it as a scene:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>load_gltf_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>asset_server</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>AssetServer</span><span>&gt;) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> scene_handle </span><span>=</span><span> asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet.gltf</span><span>");
</span><span>    commands</span><span>.</span><span>spawn_scene</span><span>(</span><span>scene_handle</span><span>);
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="bevy-ecs-improvements">Bevy ECS Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="query-ergonomics">Query Ergonomics</h3>
<p>In this release I finally was able to remove the one thing I <em>truly despised</em> in Bevy ECS. In previous versions of Bevy, iterating over the components in a <code>Query</code> looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// The `&amp;mut` here just felt so unnatural
</span><span>}

</span><span>// Or if you preferred you could do this
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// query.iter().iter()? Really???
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Similarly, retrieving a specific entity's component's looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>if let </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> result</span><span>) =</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>entity</span><span>(</span><span>entity</span><span>) {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Some</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)) =</span><span> result</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>() {
        </span><span>// access components here
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>In <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong> you can just do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// iteration
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// sweet ergonomic bliss
</span><span>}

</span><span>// entity lookup
</span><span>if let </span><span>Ok</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)) =</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>entity</span><span>) {
    </span><span>// boilerplate be gone!
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You might naturally be thinking something like:</p>
<p><em>Why did this take so long? Why would removing a single <code>&amp;mut</code> be hard?</em></p>
<p>It's a long story! In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old api looked the way it did for a reason. It was the result of good design choices that protect against unsafe memory access in a parallel environment.</li>
<li><code>query.iter()</code> didn't actually return an iterator. It returned a <em>wrapper</em> that held an atomic lock on the component storages. The same was true for the type returned by <code>query.entity()</code></li>
<li>Removing these "wrapper types" would have allowed unsafe behavior because another Query could access the same components in a way that violated Rust's mutability rules.</li>
<li>Due to the iterator implementation and quirks in the rust compiler, removing the wrapper type <em>tanked</em> iteration performance by about ~2-3x.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately we finally found ways to solve all of these problems. The newly added <code>QuerySets</code> allow us to completely remove the locks (and wrapper types). And by completely rewriting <code>QueryIter</code> we were able to avoid the performance hit that removing the wrapper incurred. Read on for the details!</p>
<h3 id="100-lockless-parallel-ecs">100% Lockless Parallel ECS</h3>
<p>Bevy ECS is now completely lock free. In Bevy 0.2, we made direct <code>World</code> access and "for-each" systems lock free. This is possible because the Bevy ECS scheduler ensures that systems only run in parallel in ways that respect Rust's mutability rules. </p>
<p>We couldn't remove locks from <code>Query</code> systems because of systems like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>conflicting_query_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>q0</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>q1</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>B</span><span>)&gt;) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> a </span><span>=</span><span> q0</span><span>.</span><span>get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>some_entity</span><span>).</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
    </span><span>let </span><span>(</span><span>another_a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) =</span><span> q1</span><span>.</span><span>get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>some_entity</span><span>).</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
    </span><span>// Aaah!!! We have two mutable references to some_entity's A component!
    // Very unsafe!
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The locks ensured that the second <code>q1.get_mut(some_entity)</code> access panicked, keeping us nice and safe. In <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong>, a system like <code>conflicting_query_system</code> will fail when the schedule is constructed. By default, <em>systems cannot have conflicting queries</em>.</p>
<p>However there are some cases where a system <em>needs</em> conflicting queries to do what it needs to do. For these cases, we added <code>QuerySets</code>: </p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>queries</span><span>: </span><span>QuerySet</span><span>&lt;(</span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>B</span><span>)&gt;)&gt;) {
    </span><span>for</span><span> a </span><span>in</span><span> queries</span><span>.</span><span>q0_mut</span><span>().</span><span>iter_mut</span><span>() {
    }

    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in</span><span> queries</span><span>.</span><span>q1_mut</span><span>().</span><span>iter_mut</span><span>() {
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>By putting our conflicting <code>Queries</code> in a <code>QuerySet</code>, the Rust borrow checker protects us from unsafe query accesses.</p>
<p>Because of this, we were able to remove <em>all</em> safety checks from <code>query.iter()</code> and <code>query.get(entity)</code>, which means these methods are now <em>exactly</em> as fast as their <code>World</code> counterparts (which we made lock-free in Bevy 0.2). </p>
<h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>
<p>Bevy had a number of nice performance improvements this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed atomic locks from Query access, making Bevy ECS 100% lock free</li>
<li>Removed archetype "safety checks" from Query access. At this point we have already verified …</li></ul></div></div>

		<p><em>Editor’s Note: Welcome Hackers! Not sure how Hacker News found this article but I see a ton of folks headed in from that website, which I presume is some sort of aggregator for news articles of interest to folks that like to hack stuff. Feel free to have a look around the website–<a href="https://tcpaworld.com/podcast/">check out our cool podcast</a>–and tell any friends that might like this nerdy stuff. But don’t hack anything please. Thanks.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Since there is absolutely nothing else going on today I figured I’d share one of the weirdest TCPA cases I’ve seen recently.</p>
<p>So apparently some guy in Nebraska named Mort who really doesn’t like a gas station called Bucky’s Gas Station. He hates it so much, in fact, that he has created a stark raving mad loony-toons (my opinion) gripes board on the internet to assail it. You can visit it, if you’d like, but be warned that your brain will melt a little: <a href="http://www.buckysgasstationsucks.com/">www.buckysgasstationsucks.com</a>.</p>
<p>I spent more time than I’d care to admit reviewing the website last night but I can’t quite figure out where the beef originated. (If you can figure it out let me know, as I am actually genuinely curious.)</p>
<p>So Bucky’s Gas Station is owned by a guy named Buchanan— who I will assume goes by Bucky whether he wants to or not—and his wife who have allegedly been subjected to years of abuse at the hands of Mort using something called a FaxTel 2000, which is something directly out of a 90s era Simpsons. Apparently Mort revs up his FaxTel 2000 and blasts Bucky and his wife with unwanted messages from time to time, just to make sure Bucky remembers how much Mort dislikes him.</p>
<p>Not stopping there, Mort also—allegedly—encourages members of the public to blast poor Bucky with calls “day and night” and to do the same with his associates and neighbors, many of whose contact information is listed on the brain-melting website. As the order tersely words it: “<em>[Mort] encourages members of the public to contact the Buchanans, their neighbors, and others they are affiliated with; and notes that the Buchanans and others will be contacted daily and nightly regarding Sullivan’s grievances</em>.”</p>
<p>Since I don’t actually know why Mort is so agitated by Bucky I can’t say that his conduct is totally inappropriate. I mean, maybe Bucky threw Mort’s puppy in a microwave or something. But either way the conduct of blasting someone’s cell phone with unwanted messages is illegal—if an ATDS is used.</p>
<p>And here’s where things finally get interesting in this yawner of a case.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff alleged that FaxTel 2000 is an autodialer because, I mean, look at the thing.</p>

<p>But Mort had a clever response—this device is so old and beaten up that it can no longer dial randomly and sequentially, plus no replacement parts are available so it lacks the capacity to dial that way in the future either. So it can’t possibly meet the TCPA’s ATDS definition.</p>
<p>I mean, its kind of a brilliant argument if you think about it (and your mind has melted a little.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mort, however, the case was decided at the pleadings stage and the Court simply could not accept Mort’s assertions on the FaxTel’s dialing capacity as those “facts” were outside the pleadings. Instead the Court had to accept Bucky’s claim that the dialer had all the needed functionality to behave as an ATDS.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Mort also argued that the TCPA infringed on his First Amendment rights but—as <strong><a href="https://tcpaworld.com/2020/10/29/happy-halloween-tcpaworld-heres-are-the-top-10-scariest-tcpa-stories-going-to-freak-you-out-this-halloween/">readers of my Halloween column know</a></strong>—the Constitution won’t save you in TCPAWorld.</p>
<p>*Insert left-over evil laugh from Halloween bargain bin here*</p>
<p>Mort finished his motion to dismiss with a claim that the TCPA only applies to telemarketing harassment, not good-ole-fashioned harassment harassment. No dice. The Court looks at the words of the statute and cannot find the “I just want to abuse people out of spite” TCPA exemption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and somewhat amusingly, the Court refused to enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mort’s conduct finding that it wanted more information and evidence before doing so. Under the circumstances of this case one might have thought ordering one party to temporarily stop blasting the other with&nbsp; robocalls would have been pretty perfunctory. But I guess the Court also wants to know about the condition of Mort’s puppies before ordering him to stop FaxTeling Bucky.</p>
<p>The case is <em>Buchanan v. Sullivan</em>, 8:20-CV-301, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202519 (D. Ne. October 30, 2020).</p>
<p>And now you may return to your low-anxiety and worry free Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hey, look at that bird outside.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 11/3/2020 at 2:24 pm pacific</strong></p>
<p>So I apparently have a new team of hackers that work for me– Czar of TCPAWorld and Czar of the Hackers?– and they think they’ve uncovered what happened here. Below is an exchange from a hacker news message board, because that’s how I roll now:</p>

It's so easy to overlook this part but reflecting on past decisions will improve your decision making 10x (don't @ me). Anyway,  I built a three properties that help with facilitating this behavior:</span></span></p><p><span><span>Firstly, </span><span><code>Review in</code></span><span>, a single choice label for the duration of weeks or months after which you want to review your decision. Parrish recommended six months as the default time frame but I thought that was too constrained, so I expanded it to one week, two weeks, one month, three month and six months. Below I will explain how you can add your own .</span></span></p><p><span><span>Secondly, I find unnecessarily annoying to add the dates and figure out where you need to set the reminder, so I wrote the </span><span><code>Review at</code></span><span> formula. It's a bunch of nested IF statements that look at </span><span><code>Review in</code></span><span> and add the corresponding timeframe to </span><span><code>Created at</code></span><span>. It looks like this:</span></span></p><pre id="2ed841786e93444cb3aeb16bcea725e5"><code><span><pre><code><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"One week"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"weeks"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"Two weeks"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"weeks"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"One month"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"months"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"Three months"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"months"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"Six months"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"months"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Decision has not been made yet"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><div id="8defbfbe696d40628a3b56bc53b88a33"><p><span><span>Right now, you can only compute one result in </span><span><code>Review at</code></span><span> that's why </span><span><code>Review in</code></span><span> is single choice.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Most good data stories start with a interesting question. If the
average request latency went down by a further 100ms, by how much
could we expect user engagement to increase? How can we detect
evidence of corruption of government officials given a list of all
bids nationwide for the building of new roads and repair of existing
ones? Can we identify a new pandemic in the making given a timeline of
common search terms? Often though, we know we have the data, but we
don’t even know what questions the data might help answer, or how the
story will unfold. From the data scientist who scratched an itch on an
idle afternoon, to a low latency, high availability, real-time
analysis deployed on hundreds of machines, the story typically
involves lots of rewrites, meanderings and building out of a lot of
code and utilities to improve the precision, speed or scale of the
analysis.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>R provides a great interactive environment for poking at the dataset
<em>du jour</em> and find what answers might be lurking in there. It provides
a wealth of readily available libraries for banging out an initial
story to tell. But R is a special purpose scripting language. Its
strength in supporting throwaway “do what I mean” programming to test
and iterate on hypotheses quickly becomes a hindrance when a model is
to be built out into an industrial scale, performant and maintainable
product or service. By then, a more general purpose language
encouraging structured, modular programming, providing strong static
guarantees of correctness and that compiles down to native code for
maximum speed becomes more appropriate. Haskell is such a language.</p>
<p>Mind you, Haskell makes for a great language to support rapid
iteration, “in the small” exploratory programming too, but it as of
yet lacks the plethora of high quality libraries from machine learning
to visualization that R provides, and perhaps also some syntactic
facilities to play it fast and loose. Today we’re proud to announce
the first public release of the
<a href="https://tweag.github.io/HaskellR/">HaskellR</a> project, which includes
a library and two interactive environments for seamlessly programming
in <em>both</em> R and Haskell in the same source file, or indeed at the same
prompt.</p>
<p>At the heart of the project lies <code>inline-r</code> (whose design later
inspired
<a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/05/inline-c">inline-c</a> - they
share a coauthor), which exports a few quasiquoters for expressing
calls to R functions and indeed arbitrary R code in R’s syntax. The
principles behind the design of <code>inline-r</code> are,</p>
<ul>
<li>use R libraries the way R intends them to be used: using R’s syntax
and calling conventions;</li>
<li>keep the overhead of crossing language boundaries as low as possible
to encourage fine grained interleaving of code in both languages;</li>
<li>zero marshalling overhead in the common case;</li>
<li>optional typing of R data as executable documentation of what
functions expect and return;</li>
<li>let the user stoop as low or jump as high as (s)he likes in the
abstraction stack: everything is under the user’s control control in
case (s)he needs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll touch upon each of the above points in more detail below and in
future posts. But first, let’s get a taste of this stuff. You may want
to consider the below setup as your go-to interactive shell if you
haven’t already: it reuses existing projects and works much like GHCi,
in an isolated sandbox if you like, except that you have inline
graphics and formulas out-of-the-box, as Shae Erisson first pioneered
in the Haskell world with <a href="https://github.com/shapr/ghclive/">ghclive</a>
and Manuel Chakravarty realized more recently on OS X with
<a href="http://haskellformac.com/">Haskell for Mac</a>.</p>
<h2>Charts, code, prose and formulas in a playground</h2>
<p>HaskellR features two interactive prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bare bones REPL, called H. This is a thin wrapper around GHCi
initializing it with all the right extensions and imports to hit the
road running;</li>
<li>an all singing, all dancing interactive notebook, powered by
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> (formerly IPython) and Andrew
Gibiansky’s fantastic
<a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell">IHaskell</a> kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we’ll talk mostly about the latter. Thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack">stack</a>, getting started
with <strong>HaskellR</strong> is pretty straightforward, and more importantly,
comparatively reliable. We put together
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tweag/haskellr/">a Docker container</a> to get
you started hassle-free. It includes <strong>Jupyter</strong> and <strong>IHaskell</strong>
preinstalled. To build <strong>HaskellR</strong> inside it:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>git</span> clone http://github.com/tweag/HaskellR
$ <span>cd</span> HaskellR
$ stack --docker build
$ stack --docker <span>exec</span> ihaskell <span>install</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And get started in your browser:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ stack --docker <span>exec</span> ipython notebook</code></pre></div>

<p>With <strong>IHaskell</strong>, you can keep your notes and formulas together with
your code in one place, called a notebook. With <strong>HaskellR</strong>’s plugin
for <strong>IHaskell</strong>, you can use widely acclaimed and very popular
R visualization packages such as <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> for
embedding plots in your notebook. Working in notebooks (aka
<a href="http://blog.haskellformac.com/blog/from-the-read-eval-print-loop-to-playgrounds">playgrounds</a>)
is convenient: they are self contained units that is easy to share
with colleagues, via email or
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">on the web</a>, and you can edit earlier
definitions while keeping the later ones in sync.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example of using R’s data analysis facilities on data
generated in Haskell. Say you have a cluster of noisy data. We’ll use
the <code>random</code> package to generate a sample set:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span><span>import</span> Control.Monad</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Random.MWC <span>as</span> MWC</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Random.MWC.Distributions</span>

<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>gen</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>MWC.create</span>
  <span>xs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>500</span> <span>$</span> <span>normal</span> <span>10</span> <span>3</span> <span>gen</span>

  <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now plot the list of x-ordinates against the list of
y-ordinates using R’s standard library <code>plot()</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>  <span>[</span><span>r</span><span>|</span> <span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>xs_hs</span><span>,</span> <span>ys_hs</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Notice how in the above, some code appears delineated in
quasiquotation blocks. This is a syntactic facility to tell the
Haskell compiler that any code inside the block should be understood
to be in R’s syntax, not Haskell’s syntax as is normally the case
outside of these blocks. We implemented a mechanism to get an embedded
instance of the R interpreter to parse that code for us, so that we
don’t have to grok R’s full surface syntax ourselves.</p>
<p>By convention, <code>_hs</code> suffixed variables don’t refer to bindings in the
R environment, but rather to bindings in the Haskell environment. In
technical terms, these variables are actually
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/template-haskell.html">antiquotations</a>
(we use convention over extra syntax so that we can reuse R’s stock
parser as-is and not implement our own). Antiquotation is the
fundamental mechanism for communicating data between R and Haskell. In
common cases, we can do so with no marshalling at all, so you can
cross the language boundaries repeatedly in a tight loop with impunity
if you like.</p>
<h2>Elements of design</h2>
<p>The core idea behind <strong>HaskellR</strong> is that language interop should be
zero-cost, or close to. There should be no reason why you would
hesitate to dip into a little bit of R to get the job done, over
reimplementing the same thing in Haskell because you’re worried about
performance or the cost of sending large volumes of data to some
remote R interpreter instance. We believe that making foreign calls
practically as fast as native calls is the key to making the
experience programming with both <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>
and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> package functions at the
same time seamless.</p>
<p>To this end, we decided to embed the R interpreter instance, that is
to say link together in the same binary the C code of the
R interpreter with the Haskell code of Haskell programs. In this way,
we can communicate with the R interpreter in the same process address
space. Many R functions are actually written in C, for speed, and
compile down to native code. Some of these primitives can be called
from Haskell as cheaply as any other foreign function call.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end of the performance story. A typically vexing
issue in cross-language programming is that the one language insists
on one representation of the data, while the other language wants its
own representation. Therefore, data typically has to be marshalled
from one representation to another constantly. In <strong>HaskellR</strong>, we
solved that problem in the following way: just use R’s representation
throughout. It’s the form that R functions expect, so they can get
straight to computing on that data when called. The trouble is, R’s
data representation is foreign to Haskell, so you lose Haskell’s
extremely powerful language facilities that work with any native
algebraic datatype, such as pattern matching. Or do you?…</p>
<p>The trick to get the best of both worlds, zero marshalling but also
pattern matching, is to define so-called view functions that provide
you with a native view as an algebraic datatype of the foreign data.
Here’s a toy and contrived example, where we define the factorial
function in Haskell but over R integers:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fact</span> <span>::</span> <span>SEXP</span> <span>s</span> '<span>R.Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span> <span>s</span> <span>(</span><span>SEXP</span> <span>s</span> '<span>R.Int</span><span>)</span>
<span>fact</span> <span>(</span><span>hexp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>R.cast</span> <span>sing</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>r</span><span>|</span> 1L <span>|</span><span>]</span>
<span>fact</span> <span>n</span><span>@</span><span>(</span><span>hexp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>R.cast</span> <span>sing</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>r</span><span>|</span> <span>n_hs</span> <span>*</span> <span>fact_hs</span><span>(</span><span>n_hs</span> <span>-</span> 1L<span>)</span> <span>|</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>hexp</code> is a view function, mapping native R data (everything is
a <code>SEXP</code> internally in R) to a Haskell-native GADT. Thanks to the type
annotations (more on that in future posts), we know statically that
the R data can only be some kind of integer vector, so we pattern
match on that, check whether it’s the singleton zero vector or not,
and recurse.</p>
<p>Aren’t we now back to marshalling? Yes and no! We carefully engineered
these view functions to be non-recursive. Non-recursive functions can
be inlined. So that when you use a view function only to pattern match
on the result immediately afterwards, as is the case above, <strong>GHC</strong> is
smart enough to recognize that the view function is constructing
a datatype value only to destructure it later, so it simplifies the
allocation away! Yes this is marshalling of sorts, but it’s
marshalling for free: there is no trace of it at runtime.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more to talk about regarding the design of
<strong>HaskellR</strong>, but this post is already …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Back in 2006-2007 my friend and I put together a spreadsheet of 20 or so high-level achievements called “Everything’s a Contest”. This included goals like “Photograph a live grizzly bear in the wild”, “Have something named after you”, and <em>“Get 10,000 (post) karma on Reddit”</em>. Despite our heated discussions about what should be on this list and the criteria for success none of us ever really did anything substantial to complete any of these goals. In early 2020 I decided to tackle one of these long-standing contests. <em>But I was going to do it with AI since I wanted to see how I could apply AI to more of my problems</em>. I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> and I appreciate its high-level abstractions and simple interfaces. For someone trying to get into deep learning, I would highly recommend it and the associated courses. This is a post about how I built a bot to gain karma on Reddit with fast.ai.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>Content on Reddit, in general, falls into two categories which you might call original content and found content. Trying to automate generating original content to post would be implementing something like <a href="https://imgflip.com/ai-meme">imgflip’s AI meme generator</a> and posting the resulting content to r/memes. While the memes that are generated are an amusing juxtaposition of tropes, they generally aren’t as good as memes that are generated by human users skilled in the art of observational comedy. Try the meme generator out and you’ll see what I mean. At some point, I did try posting one of those just to see how well it did.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.a8b.io/images/reddit/3migr03n6m251.jpg#mid" alt="Drake meme with text Staying in the Server / Watching Anime">
    <figcaption>I went through about 100 auto generated memes before I got this. This post got ~35 points with the title 'An AI generated this meme. Good to know it's putting its sentience to good use.'</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>The other approach would be finding content online and posting it. I chose this route for automation because while generating high-quality content is more interesting it’s also far more challenging and involved. Rather than being disadvantaged in trying to catch up to the “human quality” of content, a computer is at the advantage since the primary differentiator between posters is the ability to search through large amounts of content and speed (who finds and posts something first). In particular, I ended up looking at news based subreddits due to a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little chances of content being a repost</li>
<li>Lots of content being generated frequently</li>
<li>Large member bases</li>
<li>A lot of the content comes from the same set of known sites</li>
</ul>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Domains for all the &gt; 1 score articles from /r/business in the last week as of October 29th 2020, showing the top few sites supply the majority of content.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Why use AI at all though? If I was going to automate posting why not just create a bot that submits all links and leaves it up to the masses to sort my fate. In general, spamming on Reddit is looked down upon, though I believe banning is up to the discretion of the subreddit moderators. While in theory I might have gotten away with it or used some sort of generic rate-limiting and hope for the best, I wanted my bot to be more like a productive member of the community submitting thoughtful content, an extension of myself, rather than a spam bot that would be the bane of its existence until forcibly removed.</p>
<p>I searched for and found many good news subreddits but I targeted initially /r/business and /r/worldnews, somewhat arbitrarily and somewhat because those areas seemed interesting to me. /r/business had a sizeable community (577k members) and relatively low frequency of posts for a news subreddit so it seemed approachable as a first target. I would build a web crawler to watch popular business news sites for new articles, and then leverage an NLP-based article classifier to determine if the article had a high chance of receiving upvotes.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="finding-and-loading-posts">Finding and loading posts</h3>
<p>To train the NLP model that will classify articles I need the article text and their corresponding Reddit scores. Unfortunately, the official Reddit API limits the amount of historic post data you can retrieve to 1000 items. Luckily there is an alternative, you can grab historic post data from <a href="https://pushshift.io/">pushshift.io</a> using code I shamelessly adapted from <a href="https://www.osrsbox.com/blog/2019/03/18/watercooler-scraping-an-entire-subreddit-2007scape/">WaterCooler: Scraping an Entire Subreddit (/r/2007scape)</a>. The output file of the script has individual lines like the one below, containing a JSON object of a post per line:</p>
<pre><code>{"author": "CALIPHATEMEDIA", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514767344, "domain": "caliphatemedia.info", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/7nc5yf/south_korea_to_regulate_bitcoin_trading_further/", "id": "7nc5yf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/business/comments/7nc5yf/south_korea_to_regulate_bitcoin_trading_further/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514841750, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "business", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzg", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "South korea to regulate bitcoin trading further with tougher measures", "url": "http://www.caliphatemedia.info/2017/12/south-korea-govt-to-introduce-tougher.html", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}
</code></pre><p>After generating a file with all the historic posts, I loaded the contents referenced by the “url” field of each JSON line into <a href="https://github.com/slaveofcode/boilerpipe3">boilerpipe3</a> which is a python library that simplifies HTML documents into their primary content text.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.a8b.io/images/reddit/reuters_article.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>boilerpipe3 simplifies this (mostly) down to what we really want which is 'By Jeffrey Dastin, Akanksha Rana 4 Min Read (Reuters) - Amazon.com INC AMZN.O on Thursday...'</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>After loading the article text I did some processing to remove pages that didn’t load properly and to truncate page text to 10k characters at most.</p>
<h3 id="training-the-model">Training the model</h3>
<p>I trained the NLP model for /r/business over a few days on approximately 271k articles from 2018-01-01 to mid-April 2020. I used an <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/text.models.awdlstm">AWD_LSTM</a> (e.g. <code>language_model_learner(data_lm, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3)</code> and <code>text_classifier_learner(data, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5)</code>) for the model with discrete labels based on the article score: neutral (0-10 points), okay (10-100), good (100-500), and great (500+). The classes are kind of arbitrary and I’ve changed them around for different iterations and subreddits. The only thing I ended up paying attention to at runtime was the non-neutral class score, so this could have been a binary classifier or even better a classifier that looks at an individual article as a candidate for multiple subreddits rather than training an individual model per subreddit. For world news I had around double the number of articles. In either case I trained in 100k article chunks due to memory limitations, reloading the existing model and tuning with the new data each time.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-bot">Building the bot</h3>
<p>I chose a few sites (Business Insider, Reuters, Bloomberg, CNN, CNBC, BBC, etc.) based on frequent sites for /r/business and put them into a script and built a crawler using requests and BeautifulSoup. Every minute or so I’d crawl the site root for new links and process the linked page with boilerpipe and pass it through the NLP model for scoring. New pages with a non-neutral score of greater than 0.25 (an arbitrary threshold I picked for this particular model) would be flagged and emailed to me using AWS SNS. Initially, I relied on filtering these incoming suggestions and submitting the articles myself using the Reddit app.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.a8b.io/images/reddit/example_email.png" alt="">
    <figcaption>An example email I received from my site poller that I called 'Reddit Postmaster'.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>My site poller is acting as a personal news aggregator that I use to generate suggestions for things to post. To remove me from this loop there are a few “last mile” problems to solve. Coding up submitting via the Reddit API is easy enough, but I don’t just submit all the articles that get passed to me, I act as a quality filter choosing not to submit things which don’t seem appropriate. I also gather an appropriate title for the Reddit post. The page title is usually not good as a post title (for example containing redundancies like the site name) directly and needs to be reformatted or the title should instead be extracted from the content for example by picking the most appropriate h1 tag on the page. Rather than refining the model to be better at classifying articles and improve the accuracy of the scoring mechanism, and then coding a new component for extracting the title, I decided to try to encapsulate these tasks into a mechanical turk task and have humans as the final gate-keeper and title generator. I can take the results from these mechanical turk tasks and submit the articles to Reddit via the Reddit API utilizing those results.</p>
<h3 id="mechanical-turk">Mechanical Turk</h3>
<p>Mechanical turk is a service for leveraging humans to complete small tasks for your application. It’s great for augmenting AI applications and collecting data via labeling tasks for them. But using it effectively isn’t without difficulties. The important thing to know about mechanical turk is that many workers on the platform are (sensibly) optimizing for task completion quantity. When using a custom qualifier for tasks, ensure the qualification you’re looking for is not apparent from the question. Similarily a bad HIT (human intelligence task) would be one where you ask the user to read an article and check some box if they think it belongs in some category. For example, I did this with /r/worldnews candidates to ensure that among other things didn’t pertain to US news, however the first fully automated submission I made to /r/worldnews was “Johnson &amp; Johnson to stop selling baby powder in the United States” which was …</p></article></div>

                        <div><p>Graphs can inform, and informed discussions can be more civil than uninformed ones. But graphs can also mislead, so we need to understand what a graph is saying when we're using it. In 2015 I gave gave a TEDx talk on making clearer election maps. The original recording was lost, then recovered and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5qn33KR7us">uploaded to Youtube</a> this summer. As election season ramps up, I'd like to continue the discussion by talking about this often-misleading map.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/countywinner_2016.png"><figcaption>2016 County-Level Winner-Takes-All map</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Different graphs are designed for different purposes. The graph above is a county-level winner-takes-all map. I'll call it a County Winner map for short. Scientists use it to quickly see which way the counties went in an election. While there is arguably no better map for seeing who won in which county, this map can be misleading when used for other purposes. We need to be aware of two of its characteristics:</p><ol><li>It doesn’t express the <strong>relative voting populations</strong> between each county. Instead, it can make people feel like each county has the same population.</li><li>It’s not designed to express the <strong>margin of victory</strong> within each county. It shows who won in a county, even if they won by just one vote. It’s a winner-takes-all graph, after all.</li></ol><h3 id="relative-voting-population">Relative Voting Population</h3><p>Half of the US population lives in these counties:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/image-1.jpg"><figcaption>Half lives in blue. Half lives in gray. Census/Business Insider</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>America can be described as a collection of densely populated metros buffered by less densely populated communities. Here’s what the “population mountains” look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/where_we_live_pop_lg.jpg"><figcaption>This map of U.S. population density appeared in Time magazine Oct. 30, 2006 issue.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>When we take the County Winner map and resize each county’s land-area to be proportionate to its population, here’s how the US looks.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/image-4.jpg"><figcaption>Mark Newman, University of Michigan</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>One downside to the cartogram, however, is that the shape and location of many territories are distorted beyond recognition. This is maybe one reason why the cartogram isn't very mainstream.</p><p>The County Winner map, however, doesn’t convey this relative population information. It's not designed to. But one might think it does. </p><h3 id="margin-of-victory">Margin of Victory</h3><p>In the general election, there are 50 concurrent presidential races, one for each state. In some of these states, the margin of victory turns out to be very small. In New Hampshire, <code>743,117 votes</code> were cast for the president in the 2016 general election. Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire by <code>2,701 votes</code>. We can seat as many people in a set of high school football bleachers.<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/IMG_2944.jpeg"><figcaption>How New Hampshire was won.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There was a <code>75.03% turnout</code> in New Hampshire, so more people could have voted that didn’t. If just 2,702 more eligible voters in New Hampshire exercised their right to vote and voted for Trump, then New Hampshire would have gone to Trump instead. With such hair thin margins, New Hampshire is neither Blue nor Red in 2016. It’s <code>50:50</code> and leaning red or blue depending on traffic and dinner plans. It would be misleading to have all of New Hampshire colored as either blue or red to represent the statewide popularity of a presidential candidate. </p><p>This characteristic also holds true at the county level. The losing candidate in a county can receive a significant number of votes. In many counties the winner won by less than a 25% margin.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/2016_margin_histogram_rb.jpg"><figcaption>Kenneth Tay, Stanford University.

Clinton's county-level percent-win margins are on the left. Trump's county-level percent-win margins are on the right. The yellow area highlights counties won with vote margins within 25%. Note that these are percent vote margins, not absolute vote margins</h6><p>In general, smaller counties were won by larger percent margins. Larger counties were won by smaller percent margins. So in the counties with the most votes cast, the runner up got a lot of votes, too. </p><p>Here’s what the County Winner map looks like when we account for vote margins by blending each red and blue vote together within each county. Purple represents 50:50:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/purple-map-2016.png"><figcaption>2016 Purple Map</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The neutralizing map is designed to express vote margins more clearly.

However, this would be visually misleading.

The statistical upper fence can be calculated using the formula <code>Q3 + 1.5 * IQR</code>. Since the county vote margins are only concerned with %DEM|%GOP, county vote totals are DEM+GOP. For vote totals, we calculate the statistical upper fence to be <code>59,828 DEM+GOP votes</code>. We need to keep in mind that <code>432 counties</code> have vote totals ≥ <code>59,828 DEM+GOP</code> and are fully opaque in the Muddy Map. </p><h2 id="practical-uses-of-the-muddy-map">Practical uses of the Muddy Map</h2><p>The formulas give the Muddy Map graph some interesting characteristics. For each county, both the percent vote margin, as well as the vote totals (≤ the statistical upper fence), are embedded in the colors of the graph.</p><p>The Practical Characteristics of the Muddy Map Algorithm:</p><ul><li>There are only two hues, <code>red (hue#0 aka hue#360)</code> and <code>blue (hue#240)</code>. Red indicates GOP win, blue indicates DEM win.</li><li>A county with a <code><em>vote margin</em> of 100%</code> will have <code>100% saturation</code>. </li><li>A county with a <code><em>vote margin</em> of 0%</code> will have <code>0% saturation</code>.

                    <p><em>Welcome HN! Dark is a programming language, structured editor, and infrastructure—all in one—whose goal is to make it 100x easier to build backend services. Check out the <a href="https://darklang.com/">website</a>, our <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/what-is-dark/">What is Dark</a> post, and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/how-dark-deploys-code-in-50ms/">How Dark deploys in 50ms</a> for more. Thanks for checking us out!</em></p><hr><p><em>Part of a set with <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">Leaving OCaml</a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/">Why Dark didn't choose Rust</a>.</em></p><p>Nothing in my life so far would have prepared me for the fact that I would be willfully choosing to move to .NET, but it's 2020, and nothing matters anymore.</p><p>I've been evaluating new languages for the Dark backend over the last 2 months or so. For a <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">bunch of reasons</a>, OCaml has been a little unsatisfactory.</p><p>Over the last few years we've always said "when we rewrite the backend", "at some point we'll rewrite and this will go away", etc. There's a lot of new code to be written on the backend, to meet our roadmap. Are we really going to write it once, and then rewrite it later? Or would it be faster to just port it now, and write the new code in the new stack?</p><p>Ultimately, I decided that if there was going to be a change, now was the time. And more importantly, if there wasn't going to be a change, now was an excellent time to fully commit to OCaml, and not be second guessing the choice.</p><p>Initially, I expected to go to Rust. <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">Rust has excellent tooling, great libraries, a delightful community, etc</a>. But after spending about a month on it, I can't say I like writing Rust. Especially, I don't like writing async code in Rust. I like a nice high level language, and that's kinda what you need when you have a project as big as Dark to build. And Rust is not that. I'll publish "Why Dark didn't choose Rust" next. Or I might call it "you'll never believe just how much a Garbage Collector does for you!", because that's the summary.</p><p>When I was working on <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/">Async benchmarks</a> before, what I was really doing was evaluating "are any of these OCaml alternatives better? And if so are they also faster?". I evaluated and expected not to like F#. I actually quite like it. It's close enough to OCaml, has great library support, and tooling which so far has been a mix of great and terrible. The 90's Microsoft tooling is still there, and that bit isn't all that great, but overall it's a much better situation than OCaml or Rust.</p><h2 id="why-did-i-chose-f-">Why did I chose F#?</h2><p>Let's start with the obvious, F# is OCaml. It's OCaml backed by the world's largest and most experienced creators of programming languages. And in the areas that OCaml is great, F# is also great! Sum types, static typing, eager execution, pipelines, immutable values, all of this is really great.</p><p>It actually has a much better type system, in my opinion. One thing that sticks out is that OCaml made it really cumbersome to use maps. Like, hashtables, associative arrays, whatever you call them. It seems the old version of Real World OCaml has been taken down, so I can't show you how unpleasant they were at the start. Now, in the latest version, they are <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/maps-and-hashtables.html">more moderately unpleasant</a> to use. Whereas in F#, you have a <code>Map&lt;OneType,AnotherType&gt;</code> and that's really it. Magic!</p><p>Of course, the main reason I chose .NET was the libraries. It has libraries for everything, what a surprise. While there aren't all that many F# first-party libraries, every vendor out there has a .NET SDK that you can use directly from F#. I look forward to finally having first-party support for <a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, <a href="https://rollbar.io/">Rollbar</a>, and Google Cloud. I'm even finally going to get to use <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, after <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/to-be-continuous/">years of telling Edith</a> I would.</p><p>The other thing I've really enjoyed is how good the docs and community content are. A lot of OCaml community content is on the language and what you can do with it. F# developers seem to just want to get shit done. There's a million blog posts, youtube videos, etc, from enterprise software developers talking about the best way to build web software. And then of course the massively detailed and useful <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">FSharpForFunAndProfit</a>, as well as <a href="http://tomasp.net/">Tomas Petricek</a>'s work - it's really great.</p><p>I think most of this is due to the size of the community. I've heard people say that there are very few F# developers; something like there's 1M C# users, 100k VB users, and 10K F# users, or something like that. I'm not sure exactly what counts as user, but I would imagine that OCaml has fewer than 100 "users" in this metric, so it feels like I'm moving to a massive community.</p><p>Not everything is amazing though. The build system is attrocious. While <code>paket</code> is roughly on par with <code>esy</code>, msbuild is 1000 times worse than <code>dune</code>. An incremental build in dune is like 1s for me, and 6s in .NET, even if nothing is happening. I know they have fancy incremental compilers for .NET so this puzzles me; if anyone has tips on getting really fast compilation in F#, <a href="mailto:paul@darklang.com">I would appreciate them</a>.</p><p>An important thing to check was whether I could compile my code to JS. Dark's execution engine runs it the editor as well, and that's one of the core things that makes Dark special. Because of this, I want to take unaltered backend code and compile it directly to JS. This isn't like <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/">Rescript</a> (which is OCaml compiled to JS with slightly different semantics and ecosystem, or it's equivalent in F#, <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>). Fortunately, F# code can be compiled to Wasm using <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>. Blazor compiles the .NET runtime to WASM and runs your code in that. It <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend/src/Wasm">barely took any code</a> to get working either (though figuring out the right incantation was not trivial).</p><h2 id="feedback-from-leaving-ocaml-blog-post">Feedback from "Leaving OCaml" blog post</h2><p><a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">Yesterday's post</a> got a lot of people to add their opinions. In addition to some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24976630">Scala</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fakenickels/status/1323304778089304070">Erlang</a> love, a lot of people pointed to F#:</p><blockquote>So...I think a decent choice to make here is to switch from OCaml to F#. You'll get almost all of the benefits and most of the drawbacks go away. And for the most part, you can directly translate the code from OCaml to F#. - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978526">darksaints</a></blockquote><blockquote>I've been using F# on GCP in production for 3 years now and it's fantastic and only getting better. You can leverage existing .NET libraries (for example, you get official GCP libraries from google) and if you use them enough it's easy enough to write a functional wrapper around them. - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978526">angio</a></blockquote><blockquote>We have considered OCaml but went for F# instead. I could not be happier. Great libraries, good tooling, in 2020 F# is a first class citizen in the cloud thanks to C# and .NET Core. You can develop on Linux, Windows, MacOS and without modification it works. Compilation times are great. Unless you want to deal with the low level nature and the C++ influence in Rust F# is a much more logical step to move from OCaml. There is dotnet fsi for REPL too. F# has access to C# libraries and it is relatively easy to write a thin wrapper that convert nulls to Nones, so you are null safe or C# style functions to ML style functions so you can use |&gt; or &lt;| etc. - <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bcwbuw/leaving_ocaml#c_uoy61u">l1x</a></blockquote><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>I recently merged the <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend">first F# code into the codebase</a>. It's an async version of the core of the Dark interpreter, connected to Giraffe (F#'s low-level interface to .NET's Kestrel web server).</p><p>My plan is to reimplement the same language, but with some of the learnings that are in the <a href="https://roadmap.darklang.com/">roadmap</a>. For example:</p><ul><li><code>Result</code> and <code>Options</code> will be types, not special cased into the language</li><li><code>Int</code> will be infinite precision (this is technically a breaking change, but not a significant one AFAICT)</li><li>breaking out the API server, using F# builtin middleware libraries</li><li>refactoring the Dark public HTTP server into composable middleware, available from within Dark</li></ul><p>I'll be working on making the equivalent to the existing Dark interpreter, keeping the semantics the same. After that, I'll be making new features from the <a href="https://roadmap.darklang.com/">Dark Roadmap</a>.</p><h2 id="implementation-plan">Implementation plan</h2><p>Dark's backend is 37K lines of OCaml, of which 8K lines are tests, and 10K lines are the Dark standard library. So there's about 20K lines to port. Should be fun. My implementation plan is to get to parity - there's plenty of time after that to take advantage of the ecosytem:</p><ul><li>finish the interpreter</li><li>connect Dark's F# backend to Dark's DB, so it can read the same data</li><li><s>compile Dark's F# interpreter to JS</s> (done, see above)</li><li>make an OCaml library to deserialize the binary opcodes in the DB and covert them into F# (via, I presume, a JSON intermediary). This will allow incoming requests to (optionally) be routed to the F# service.</li><li>add a fuzzer to ensure the semantics of the OCaml and F# versions of Dark are the same (especially the library functions)</li><li>do all the devops (getting it into k8s, etc)</li><li>add the APIs we have available in OCaml</li><li>add a way for users to safely try their code in the new version</li><li>port over 170 or so functions we have in the standard library</li><li>start recording traces using <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/evolving-darks-tracing-system/">the new design</a> (this is actually the main thing driving the whole change, believe it or not!)</li><li>use <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, R<a href="http://rollbar.com/">ollbar</a>, and Google Cloud using their .NET native interfaces</li><li>port our <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/services">various services</a> to F# (lower priority)</li><li>port our accounts to self-managed from Auth0</li><li>translate the <a href="https://docs.darklang.com/contributing/ocaml-for-dark-developers">contributor docs</a> to F#</li></ul><p>There's lots to do, and <a href="https://docs.darklang.com/contributing/getting-started">Dark contributors</a> are welcome to take part. Porting standard library functions might be an easy place to get started, as is adding language features. Most things are a straight port from OCaml, except as mentioned above.

                    <p>If you've browsed the web in the last 10 years then you'll have seen more than your fair share of cookie banners!</p><p>Intended as a workaround to the <a href="https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/">2011 EU Cookie Law</a>, cookie consent banners have become so commonplace that most people <a href="https://www.amazeemetrics.com/en/blog/76-ignore-cookie-banners-the-user-behavior-after-30-days-of-gdpr/">don't even bother to look at them</a>, or just click accept on everything. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-10.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-9.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>As I see it, the purpose of the Cookie Law was to <strong>stop websites from storing data in your browser unless they absolutely needed to</strong>, by requiring them to prompt their visitors for consent. The end goal being to give you more control over your online privacy, stop needless tracking, and make website owners think twice about what they were doing. In short - a good intentioned idea.</p><p>However, basically every website in the world took the easier, less introspective approach - prompting for consent - creating an objectively worse web experience for everyone.</p><p>Since at <a href="https://leavemealone.app/">Leave Me Alone</a> we're trying to set an example of how to run a privacy friendly company, we decided to figure out how we could remove all the cookies from our landing page without sacrificing anything important. This means no more cookie banner, no more tracking! 🍪</p><p>We had three main cookie monsters that will be well known to SaaS companies;</p><ol><li>Web analytics</li><li>Live Chat</li><li>Security (DDOS protection etc)</li></ol><p>Before we start, I'm not neccessarily saying I distrust any of these companies and how they use cookies...so make your own judgement about them. We're just in this to get cookie free! </p><h2 id="web-analytics">Web Analytics</h2><p>To track our page views and general visitor behaviour, like <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">most sites</a>, we were using Google Analytics. </p><p>Google Analytics sets a little cookie on page load to "remember" what a visitor has done on each page as they navigate around a site. This allows it to create a profile of the visitor so you can figure out exactly what it takes to get a visitor to sign up or convert, or whatever it is that you're trying to measure.</p><p>Realistically we never really use this information, so it's an easy one to get rid of. There are actually a handful of simpler web analytics platforms that don't use cookies, and we opted to try <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>. With this we get basically all the info we ever got out of Google Analytics (page views), so it seems like a great compromise.</p><p>You can even make your analytics pages public, which fits nicely with our "<a href="https://blog.leavemealone.app/how-we-share-company-stats-and-metrics-publicly/">open startup</a>" work ethic. For example you can view the stats for this <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/blog.leavemealone.app">blog post here</a>!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png"><figcaption>The page view anaylitcs for Simple Analyics - meta!</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>🍪 Cookie Verdict = 5/5, no cookies, no problem.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="live-chat">Live Chat</h2><p>Having an annoying chat widget is another common thing for a SaaS homepage. We used to use Crisp for this, which uses a cookie to match a browser session to messages in their system. Their <a href="https://help.crisp.chat/en/article/crisp-chatbox-cookie-and-ip-policy-1147xor/">privacy policy</a> says this is "not used for tracking purposes", but given all the data they show in their UI about visitors that's not exactly much comfort. </p><p>(It even guesses a load of personal info from the visitors' email address like what company they work for and their job title using something called <a href="https://go.crisp.chat/notice/domain-enrich/">Crisp Enrich</a> which is apparently impossible to find any info about but sounds shady as hell).</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-6.png"><figcaption>I don't know why I would care about half of the stuff Crisp automatically collect on people who are just asking for help on my website 🤷‍♂️</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, this is a top priority since it looks like an absolute privacy and tracking nightmare.</p><p>I get that this is a difficult one, but there's literally no service we could find to do this cookieless (or even mildly privacy focused) so we ended up heavily modifying an open-source project called <a href="https://github.com/idoco/intergram">Intergram</a> to do what we wanted. Intergram works like a regular chat widget, but it communicates with the chat app Telegram via a self-hosted server - meaning at least we're in control of the code. Our modified chat widget now looks like this (and the code is <a href="https://github.com/squarecat/squarechat">open-source</a>);</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/Group-54.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Unfortunately it still requires some place to store the messages locally so that the visitor has a copy of them, but we still made this work by only storing anything <em>after</em> the chat has been opened. Unlike Crisp that injected it's cookies when it felt like it. We also don't collect any tracking crap like Crisp does, only chat messages!</p><p>We sweetened the deal by adding a consent prompt to the chat widget itself like this;</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/Group-53.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>🍪 Cookie Verdict = 3/5 - fewer cookies, more privacy.</p><h2 id="security">Security</h2><p>This was a tricky one. We use Cloudflare as a security layer to protect the website from denial-of-service attacks. We also use their CDN to cache our assets so that the site loads extra fast, and use their DNS because it's hella convenient.</p><p>To perform their protection Cloudflare stores a cookie called <em><code>_cfduid</code></em>,<em> </em>which is used to track each client and somehow figure out if they're a malicious actor or something. I don't really know and <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies">their description is clear as mud</a>. Whatever it does, it's got to go.</p><p>I didn't really know where to start with this one, so <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings/status/1315945593471205376">I tweeted about it</a> and got a reply from a systems engineer that works there:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/Slice-1-1.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Which is a bit of a non-answer, since the Enterprise plan costs $200/month and I'd end up with fewer features for my trouble.</p><p>Since we've never actually had to use Cloudflare protection, my solution was to disable Cloudflare forwarding completely and switch to a proper CDN provider. You can do this by clicking the cloud icon on the DNS settings switching to "DNS only":</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-11.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>This means we are now just using Cloudflare for DNS. But it's possible to hit this button again and <strong>re-enable</strong> Cloudflare forwarding temporarily if we find ourselves under attack, so I figure this is a good option.</p><p>For a CDN provider we decided on recommendation to check out <a href="https://bunnycdn.com/">BunnyCDN</a>. I'm actually really impressed by this service, compared to Cloudflare everything feels a bit faster and it's easier to know what's going on, which I like. Also since it's just a file CDN there are zero cookies of course!</p><p>🍪 Cookie Verdict = 6/5 - No cookies AND a faster website!</p><p>The website now has no cookies on load, with some storage being used if a visitor opens the chat widget, which I think is a pretty successful outcome! </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-8.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>You can check it out <a href="https://leavemealone.app/">here</a>, you'll notice there's no cookie banner to annoy you, it's almost like stepping back in time ;)</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>PS.</p><p>If you enjoyed this post then check out <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesIvings">my Twitter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro" aria-label="intro permalink"></a>Intro</h2>
<p>At this moment in my career, I’m a Javascript fullstack developer in the early stages. I’ve a good knowledge of Javascript, however React gives me sometimes a little more than a headache to understand deeply. I grew up in my learning with class based components, so later, when hooks were introduced, I found a little difficult to transition to this new way of writing React. That’s why I wanted this course. </p>
<p>As part of my learning process, I’m going to note down not everything, but what I learnt, for each section. Often my solution was, although working, more complicated and less elegant than Kent’s one. That’s another aspect I wish to improve in my coding. </p>
<p>Of course you will find many more details and, well, the workshop itself directly in <a href="https://epicreact.dev/">epicreact.dev</a>
I hope this will be useful to somebody else apart from me, and forgive my mistakes in English (not a native speaker).
<br></p>
<h2 id="01-basic-javascript-rendered"><a href="#01-basic-javascript-rendered" aria-label="01 basic javascript rendered permalink"></a>01: Basic JavaScript-rendered</h2>
<p>In the first exercise, it’s necessary to make some DOM manipulation with plain Javascript. As I’m using this method in my daily work, I had no difficulties in the first part. As a matter of fact, I’m learning a lot into transforming a codebase that is heavily relying on jQuery into plain Javascript.</p>
<p>However, I did have to do some thinking on the additional exercise, as I’m not used to work with the root element of the body. So I personally didn’t know -but now that I know, it makes sense - that there’s a body object inside the document object. I won’t give here the solution, but it’s an important reminder to always check the parent elements… what are they hiding inside :)
<br></p>
<h2 id="02-intro-to-raw-react-apis"><a href="#02-intro-to-raw-react-apis" aria-label="02 intro to raw react apis permalink"></a>02: Intro to raw React APIs</h2>
<p>The second exercise of the workshop was already trickier - which I was happy about because definitely I didn’t want to learn again the same stuff.
It’s not often, if ever, that we are using the React.createElement. Using JSX we just skip this part, but that’s how it works under the hood.
So after learning what jQuery is doing in Javascript, now it’s React in Javascript. </p>
<p>First thing I learnt here is that the famous property ‘children’, in React, corresponds to textContent in plain JS. It makes sense, of course, as a matter of fact we are rendering some text made visually in HTML.</p>
<p>The second thing is that createElement has three - or more - arguments that can be passed. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The type of element (span, div, etc)</li>
  <li>The object passed inside the element (class, children, etc)</li>
  <li>A n number of other objects, that will be rendered as additional children.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a matter of fact, the children property doesn’t even have to be defined inside the second argument of createElement, but can be listed at the end of the method.
<br></p>
<h2 id="03-using-jsx"><a href="#03-using-jsx" aria-label="03 using jsx permalink"></a>03: Using JSX</h2>
<p>The third exercise was about creating simple JSX elements that Babel will transform in normal JS with React.createElement. As it’s basically almost a reverse engineering of the previous exercises, it was not difficult. However, it was interesting the use of the spread operator inside a div element, which createElement puts in the correct position:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const className = 'myClass';
const children = 'this is my text';
const props = { children, className }
element = &lt;div {...props}/&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>It will create a div with its own class and the innertext as children.</p>
<p>Another interesting point in the video is about prioritazion of position using the spread operator. Supposing that we have the above props, but then we want to override the className with another name, we have to place the spread props before. In synthesis, the right argument will always override the left ones.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div {...props, className='secondClass'} /&gt; // &lt;div className="secondClass"&gt;
&lt;div {className='secondClass', ...props} /&gt; // &lt;div className="myClass"&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="04-creating-custom-components"><a href="#04-creating-custom-components" aria-label="04 creating custom components permalink"></a>04: Creating custom components</h2>
<p>So here we go finally to start creating components. The first part consists in creating a function that basically returns a div, so instead of repeating div div in the rendered element, we just pass the function with the string as “children”. One thing that I knew but forgot explicitly is that if I pass a parameter to the function as an object, the argument must be an object as well. So:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>helloFunction = ({children}) =&gt; {
  return &lt;div&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;
}

helloFunction({ children: 'Hello' });</code></pre></div>
<p>The next point was to implement this function as an element:</p>
<p><code>const myElement = React.createElement(message, { children: 'Hello!' })</code></p>
<p>and finally incorporate it in the element itself, which will be taken into ReactDom.render:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const element = (
  ...
  {myElement}
)</code></pre></div>
<p>Following that, it’s about referring the same helloFunction but make it directly compiled through Babel as an element, without needing to pass through createElement. This is possible thanks to JSX, and it’s enough to make the function name with first letter as capital, and reference it inside the element object as that.
<code>HelloFunction = () = {}</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;HelloFunction&gt;Hello!&lt;/HelloFunction&gt;</code></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of <code>React.createElement(HelloFunction, null, 'Hello!')</code></p>
<p>Next, it was the time of implementing propTypes for typechecking, giving the same above function to have two parameters, both strings. In the workshop, it’s explained how to make a propTypes function for checking manually the type. But it’s interesting that it’s not taking advantage of the prop-types library. It is true that for a simple check of two props, importing a whole library is excessive; but I don’t think I’ll ever just use two checks. </p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types@15.6/prop-types.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>HelloFunction.propTypes = {
      greeting: PropTypes.string,
      subject: PropTypes.string,
    }</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m not getting either a personalized message, but the standard warning is understandable enough</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Invalid prop `subject` of type `number` supplied to `Message`, expected `string`. in HelloFunction</code></pre></div>
<p>Ah, here we go, in the next exercise there’s the implementation of the library… ooooops, I went a little over head. But good point, to implement also ‘isRequired’</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>HelloFunction.propTypes = {
      greeting: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      subject: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    }</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, Typescript rules!
<br></p>
<h2 id="05-styling"><a href="#05-styling" aria-label="05 styling permalink"></a>05: Styling</h2>
<p>In this  exercise it was needed to apply style to a custom component in various ways. On a first part, just adding inline styling to a small div; then to a custom component passing its className prop; finally, passing only a string as a size prop and selecting dynamically the style inside the custom component.</p>
<p>First note: when making a reusable component, normally it’s good to place all defaults on the left and what the user is providing (spread operator) after, because we don’t want to enforce something.</p>
<p>Second note: as usual I overcomplicated things. As the size property passed would be only small, medium and large, and the classes are called box—small, box—medium, box—large, it’s enough to substitute the size with the size prop passed into the component.</p>
<p><code>box--${size}</code></p>
<p>adding that to a ternary operator in case it’s the prop is not present.
What I did instead was a nested ternary operator with an object created with the classes names inside. Much more complicated, although it was working 😁</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const sizes = {
  small: 'box--small',
  medium: 'box--medium',
  large: 'box--large'
}

className={`box ${size === 'small' ? sizes.small : size === 'medium' ? sizes.medium : sizes.large}`}</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="06-forms"><a href="#06-forms" aria-label="06 forms permalink"></a>06: Forms</h2>
<p>In the first exercise, the object is creating a submit listener/handler that will call the function in the main component, which is passed through as a prop.</p>
<p>We can put events (will be React synthetic events) on each element; however, the onSubmit goes inside the form to catch every field that is contained.
Synthetic events are objects that React creates that look and behave like regular DOM events.
It’s still possible to access the DOM event with <code>event.nativeEvent</code>, however, the synthetic one is optimized to work with React code, and the virtual DOM.</p>
<p>I created then a function inside the function (a callback), called once the submit button is clicked. And I’ve added the preventDefault() to that event to prevent the page to refresh (as default event for a form).</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is about accessibility. Screen readers need to associate the input with its label. So it’s needed to give the input an id and the label a htmlFor (the same for= parameter in normal HTML). Moreover, this gives the property of focusing on the input when clicking on it.</p>
<p>The second part of the exercise was about doing the same as above but using the useRef hook. UseRef are simply reference pointers to an element.
First, it’s needed to be imported from ‘react’ and not ‘react-dom’.</p>
<p>Then, adding the reference to our input
<code>&lt;input ref={usernameInput}&gt;</code>
In the main function (or custom component), we can call the hook: <code>const usernameInput = useRef(null);</code>
Why null? The argument of useRef is the initial value. But in this case we don’t need that, just what will be in usernameInput.</p>
<p>Finally, we can access all our referenced properties, like the input value, this way: <code>usernameInput.current.value</code></p>
<p>In the next credit, it was needed to create a controlled input. A controlled input is an input field that is controlled by the component state. That means setting the value of the input by the state: <code>&lt;input ref={usernameInput}  value={username} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;</code></p>
<p>Then, we can set the state at the top of the component: <code>const [username, setUsername] = useState('');</code>
And finally, use that state to change the value of the input in the handleChange function. In this case, transforming every key to lowercase:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const { value } = event.target;
setUsername(value.toLowerCase());</code></pre></div>
<p>So the flow is the following:
input from user —&gt; update input state —&gt; transforming input state -&gt; sending the state as value of the input —&gt; input appears on screens.
<br></p>
<h2 id="07-rendering-arrays"><a href="#07-rendering-arrays" aria-label="07 rendering arrays permalink"></a>07: Rendering Arrays</h2>
<p>The exercises were just little demonstrations in this case, to show the importance of using a unique index key when showing elements in the DOM through a mapping. Not without, not with the pre-built index of the map function, but with a preset set of keys to …</p></div></div>

<p>
When I was a kid, computers were cool.</p><p>

Nowadays? Not so much.</p><p>

I know, I know. Grumpy old gits are a dime a dozen, and their views about the past are often filtered through a golden haze of blissful forgetfulness and nostalgia. This is of course the case for me, too, but I still think the point is valid: computers used to be much cooler - by orders of magnitude - than they are now.</p><p>

The situation can perhaps be explained by an analogy: You've got a rusty old 1994 FIAT Punto and there is a rather pressing need for you to invest in a new vehicle. Of course, you can dream big - maybe you'd like some kind of armoured personnel carrier, perhaps a souped-up, pimped-out Tesla with all the bells and whistles or why not a Ferrari? Realistically, though, you're probably considering something along the lines of a brand new Ford: the kind of sensible family car that would still be an upgrade to the withering piece of junk you're currently driving. And, as soon as you've amassed enough funds, that's probably what you're going to buy. That APC, though... Man, how sweet would it be to drive one of those? Just thundering through morning traffic, fist pumping in the air, shouting crude insults at that guy with the SUV who always cuts in front of you at the intersection down by the grocery store. Not so smug now, eh, Mr. Sports Utility?</p><p>

That's what it used to be like with computers.</p><p>

Don't get me wrong. You can spend nearly infinite amounts of money on a computer if you'd like to - it's always been like that and probably will be for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for supercomputer clusters used in science and the mainframes keeping the banks and stock markets ticking. But when dreaming about computer power, few of us imagine having access to a behemoth like that. The things we do with our machines can only go faster up to a certain point, unless we dabble in computational biology in our spare time. It would be like replacing our feeble FIAT with an aircraft carrier: sure, it's powerful, but it's not very practical for getting to and from work.</p><p>

No, the computer we dream about having on our desk is usually something a little bit faster, a little bit sleeker and just a little bit more expensive than what we can actually afford. If you're a dedicated games player, there's always the next graphics card, that extra gig of RAM, those extra few frames per second you can chase - but that's still the realistic dreaming, it's something within reach; perhaps not quite in line with a sensible Ford, but not as far out there as an APC.</p><p>

And, even if you are currently dreaming of the home computer equivalent of an APC (let's pretend that's a top of the line Mac Pro, just for the sake of argument), getting one won't make much of a difference in day to day use. Sure, the machine might be faster than your current one, but except for the rare few cases when you actually utilize all that power, it won't provide a profoundly different user experience compared to what an iMac will deliver at a fraction of the cost. It's the same OS, the same applications and the same basic architecture. This is true for Windows and Linux machines as well: you can add more RAM and disk and CPU cores, but the machine won't behave in a significantly different way from what you're used to.</p><p>

Now, when I was a kid... computers were cool.</p><p>

In 1994, I bought a second hand Amiga 1200 with a 120 megabyte hard drive. It was a low cost, capable home computer with good sound and graphics. It was more than enough for the kind of gaming and school work a kid my age wanted to do, but the 14 MHz processor was a tad slow when it came to heavy lifting. Applying just a hint of Gaussian blur to a very low resolution JPEG file took ages. Dabbling in animation, I frequently hit the barrier of the 2 megs of RAM it came with. However, it also had a motherboard connector for adding more memory and a faster CPU. This was the reasonable dream: it was within my reach, it was the sensible family Ford.</p><p>

Thus, in 1995, I got a CPU and RAM upgrade for it, making it roughly four times faster. In those days, that was a pretty hefty upgrade: speeding up from 10 to 40 MPH is more noticeable to a human compared to the difference between the 10000 and 40000 MPH speeds of today's machines. But the speed-up didn't profoundly change my user experience. I was still shuffling about with the same old software and I was still waiting around for that Gaussian blur calculation to finish - although not quite as many minutes as before.</p><p>

As I sat there, watching the Gaussian blur progress bar, I of course dreamt of the computing equivalent of an Armoured Personnel Carrier. It wasn't an Amiga 4000 or a Pentium PC or one of those new-fangled PowerMacs. It was something completely different, something that would have utterly changed my all-round user experience, from boot-up to shutdown. I wanted something the likes of which actually no longer exists: I dreamt of a Unix Workstation.</p><p>

Not just any old Unix box mind you, but a rather specific one: a Silicon Graphics Indy with a 24-bit frame buffer, 128 megabytes of memory and a 175 MHz MIPS R4400 CPU.</p><p>

It was, hands down, just about the most maxed-out piece of hardware that could grace the top of a desk. Design-wise, computers have always been kind of beige - literally and figuratively. Black computers became commonplace some time around, say, 2000, but that was hardly a giant leap in design. Depending on your tastes, you might think companies like Apple or Alienware produce attractive machines - but then again, perhaps you've never seen an SGI Indy.</p><p>

The teal blue pizza box case sports a horizontal, slightly diagonally skewed cut along the middle, shifting the top and bottom parts in a slight offset. The monitor was huge for its time: a 17" CRT cased in grey granite plastic, matching the mouse and keyboard. Both the computer and the screen were adorned with embossed SGI cube logos in a gleaming silver finish. It was over the top, maximalist 1990s more-is-more design in a strangely tasteful package and a far cry from the sleek, subdued designer machines of today. Yet, it wasn't an overstatement - it might've talked the talk, but it sure as hell could walk the walk.</p><p>

For example, it didn't even have a regular floppy drive - it had a bizarre floptical unit capable of storing 20 megabytes on a single, magneto-optical disk. On top of the giant screen a webcam was poised, surely one of the absolutely first computers to come with such a device as standard. In fact, it was called an IndyCam - the term webcam hadn't really caught on yet and was more commonly used to describe just about any camera that regularly uploaded a still image to a public web server.</p><p>

And that, of course, are all trivial oddities compared to the guts of the machine. Even though it was an entry-level workstation, SGI's custom hardware was capable of churning out both 2D and 3D graphics unmatched by any contemporaneous gaming PC, however expensive, and the CPU could run in circles around even the most outrageously-priced Pentium home computer available at the time.</p><p>

And then there was the operating system. And the software.</p><p>

IRIX, SGI's in-house Unix flavour, came with their own proprietary GUI and desktop. It was called Indigo Magic and, featuring things like scalable vector icons, animated desktop backgrounds and visual feedback cues, it was just about as outlandish as the name suggests. It should be noted that this was ten years before any PC owner had gotten the chance to grow tired of such pointless flash and that for the serious hacker, there was always a terminal emulator with a capable shell on hand.</p><p>

Apart from all the usual Unix-related niceties such as stability, pre-emptive multitasking, multi-user support, excellent command line utilities and a bunch of readily available programming languages, it had an impressive array of professional productivity software. Most of it was not available on my home computer, and even if it was, the Indy could run it both faster and in higher resolution. Apart from industry standards such as Photoshop and Netscape, there was a world of curious and wonderful applications written with nothing but SGI hardware in mind: web authoring, video editing, image manipulation and graphics creation unavailable on any other platform. It was a true digital media production workhorse, an overgrown distant cousin to the machines available on the then budding multimedia PC market.</p><p>

In short, it was a cool computer. Far too expensive for any home user, of course. But so. Damn. Cool.</p><p>

There are computers aimed at this kind of work today as well. One of the high-end Macs mentioned before, for example, or perhaps a suitably high-powered Windows machine. In fact, pretty much any dirt cheap home computer will, pixel for pixel, do what the Indy did - except faster, cheaper and in many cases better.</p><p>

Yet there isn't, today, an equivalent of the SGI Indy, or the Sun SPARCstation, or the DEC Alpha, or any of the other professional workstations. The only thing that's on offer is more of the same user experience, only slightly faster.</p><p>

That's why computers are so boring these days. Because even though IRIX, Indigo Magic and the Indy by no means was a perfect solution to all of my computational desires back then, it had the lure of the unknown and unattainable: it was a goal to strive for, a source of inspiration and aspiration and a promise that better things were possible.</p><p>

Today, we all know about the different quirks, mannerisms, privacy issues, drawbacks and occasional benefits of Windows update loops, overpriced Mac hardware and the tiresome fiddliness of Linux. Those are the choices we have and they're not going to change any time soon.</p><p>

I'd somehow be more okay with all of this if it wasn't for the fact that, to top it all off, we have no other platform left to dream of.</p><p>

That's just not cool.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Last month’s news that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/ibm-to-split-into-two-companies-by-the-end-of-2021/">IBM would do a Hewlett-Packard</a> and divide into two—an IT consultancy and a buzzword compliance unit—marks the end of “business as usual” for yet another of the great workstation companies.</p>
<p>A quick aside on computing history. You can imagine personal computing being driven by two distinct schools of thought. The “top down” school, represented by research-led organisations including Xerox PARC, Bell Labs,academia and the military, asked “what would the world be like if everyone had their own minicomputer”? They took large, time-sharing systems like UNIX and installed them first under, then on, employees’ desks for their own personal use.</p>
<p>The “bottom up” school was made up of hobbyists who asked “can we make an interesting computer out of inexpensive components”? Thus companies like Apple and MITS in the US, Acorn and Sinclair Radionics in the UK, and others took chips that were usually used as peripherals controllers in “real” computers and built interactive programming systems around them. The microcomputer revolution came from the bottom-up school, as they made home computing affordable. The workstation revolution came from the top-down school, as they made powerful on-demand computing feasible.</p>
<p>The two schools came into very close proximity in the 1980s, when the Motorola 68000 family of CPUs (along with the 68881/68882 FPU and 68851 MMU) were the processors of choice in everything from entry-level PCs like the Atari 520ST, through games consoles like the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in the US), to the most expensive UNIX workstations from NeXT Computer, Sun Microsystems, and Apollo Computer.</p>
<p>But then the workstation makers invested heavily in their own CPU architectures based on RISC design principles and again the two diverged. The workstation market became highly differentiated: RS/6000 from IBM (later PowerPC), Alpha from Digital Equipment Corp, MIPS from, well, MIPS, SPARC from Sun, PA-RISC from HP. The software on these workstations, while superficially very similar, was also differentiated and surprisingly incompatible. Take a program from HP-UX and you’ll have difficulty running it on NeXTSTEP, unless the authors shared the source code and used the nascent GNU autotools to support portable building. As Yoda said: begun, the <a href="https://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_war.htm">UNIX wars</a> have.</p>
<p>Of course we know that the (desktop) computing world today is mostly Intel and that workstations are mostly fancy PCs, rather than bespoke designs by vertically-integrated companies, Apple being the two trillion dollar outlier. How we got here was that the commodity parts got good enough that there was no evident advantage to workstation-grade hardware. A high-end PC could easily run a workstation OS like System V UNIX (Solaris was an early example), BSD (386BSD which later became FreeBSD, or NeXTSTEP) or Windows NT.</p>
<p>Along the way, the workstation companies consolidated (Apollo and eventually DEC got absorbed into HP; MIPS into SGI) or disappeared altogether (Sun became Oracle Hardware; SGI went bankrupt and sold its assets to sgi; Symbolics did similar—incidentally Symbolics was the first company with a .com domain). IBM long ago stopped even making its own brand PCs, and the news of its split means that there are now very few workstation companies trading in the same form they had “back in the day”. The only ones I can think of that have not had major changes to their corporate structures are Xerox and Sony, whose management may not even have known that they sold workstations.</p>
<p>What’s got lost alongside the death of the workstation is the business model where you sell expensive computers as part of an integrated solution into a particular vertical market, where that expensive solution will cost a lot less than cobbling something together out of cheap PCs. Why? I think people have a lower expectation and higher pain threshold when using computers now; they expect an amount of friction based on their own experience and translate that expectation into realms where it doesn’t belong. As I described way back in issue 2, <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-various-meanings-of-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computing is a lemon market</a>.</p>
<p>Organisations would go to the workstation vendors because they solved particular problems very well. If you’re in AI, you need Symbolics. Computer graphics, SGI. Telecoms, that’d be Sun. If you want to write software in Ada for the military-industrial complex, you’ll be buying a Rational workstation. Yes, the first IDE was a completely integrated package of hardware and software. And, of course, Apple for Desktop Publishing, the Mac being a workstation of sorts itself. People would buy computers <em>because</em> applications like AutoCAD, Quark or Mathematica ran well on them. They wouldn’t buy the computer then browse the App Store to see whether it could do anything useful.</p>
<p>And the strange thing is that catering to those vertical markets with integrated solutions is easier than ever now. The wide availability of free software means that the basic job of “being a desktop computer” is taken care of at zero cost, so business can focus on contributing valuable bespoke behaviour. And hardware costs are lower than ever: the availability of high-capability SoCs and single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and Rock64 should make it a no-brainer to sell the computers as accessories for the applications, not the other way around.</p>
<p>In high-tech domains, an engineer could readily have a toolchest of suitable computers in the same way that a mechanic has different tools for their tasks. This one has an FPGA connected by both PCI-E and JTAG to allow for quick hardware prototyping. This one is connected to a high-throughput GPU for visualisations; that one to a high-capacity GPU for scientific simulations.</p>
<p>The general purpose hardware vendors want us to believe that an okay-at-anything computer is the best for everything: you don’t need a truck, so here’s a car. But when you’re hauling a ton of goods, you’ll find it cheaper and more satisfying to shell out more for a truck. Okay-at-anything is good for nothing.</p>

<p>Perhaps lost in the whirlwind of presidential name-calling, a lesser-known multi-year old feud has resurfaced on Twitter this election season. Nate Silver is the founder of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> and is a popular statistician frequently called upon by media members to give commentary and expertise on election forecasting. Nassim Taleb is a statistician/quant turned philosopher, perhaps most well known for authoring the book “The Black Swan”. He is second most well known for calling people names on Twitter. In this 2018 instance he seemed to take issue with FiveThirtyEight’s election forecasts, saying that <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1059202026184282113">“klueless Nate Silver” “doesn’t know how math works”</a>, among a host of other insults. Silver responded that Taleb was an <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1062782704159256576">“intellectual-yet-idiot”</a>, an phrase coined by Taleb himself. Ouch. A litany of statisticans, mathematicians, and data scientists came out of the woodwork to take sides. Taleb himself <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1314902682570764288">doubled down</a> on Oct. 10, 2020, again calling Silver “totally clueless”.</p>

<p>In this article I take a look behind the mathematical premises of Taleb’s arguments, and give intuitive explanations of why or why not they hold up. In short, while Taleb’s math is sound, he still manages to miss the mark by ignoring the nuance of Silver’s forecasts.</p>

<p>Taleb’s main gripe is that forecasters change their opinion too much over time. Take a look at FiveThirtyEight’s forecast from the 2016 presidential election, where the probability of Clinton winning peaked at 90%, and hit a low of 50%. 
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/2016election.png" alt="2016 election"></p>

<p>Taleb insists that Clinton never should’ve received a probability of winning of 90%. Even if polls were heavily in favor of Clinton at the time, he says Silver should’ve taken into account the uncertainty that polls would change over the next few months leading up to the election, or the possibility of major news breaking. If Silver had factored in the “unknown unknowns” his forecast should’ve been closer to 50%. In essence, this single number should reflect all <em>current and future uncertainty</em>. Taleb constructs this argument by way of quantitative finance, which perhaps led to him and traditional statisticians talking past each other. In the following sections I step through his argument in intuitive terms.</p>


<p>A well known truth to economists, quants, and traders: if I tell you a number, I must be willing to transact at that number. If I tell you the fair value of this house is $500,000, I must be willing to buy AND sell at that price. Otherwise, the number I gave you is meaningless. Likewise, if I tell you the probability of Biden winning this election is 73%, I must be willing to pay $0.73 to make the following wager: if Biden wins I receive $1, if he loses I receive $0.</p>

<p>This is important because it turns the predicted probabilities into a tradeable financial instrument known as a binary option. If the prediction is 50%, I can buy the option at $0.50. If the prediction moves to 65%, I can now sell the option at $0.65, turning a $0.15 profit.</p>

<p>This brings us to another important principle known as the <em>no-arbitrage condition</em>. If the election predictions are accurate, there should be no way for a trader to make guaranteed money by trading this option. To give an illustrative example, let’s say that we live in an unchanging world where the probability of Candidate A winning is static at 50%. If a pollster does not report a static forecast day after day, he will create an arbitrage opportunity. We will sell when the prediction is above 50%, and buy below. 
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/arbitrage-pollster.jpeg" alt="Arbitrage condition"></p>

<p>OK, so now we’ve established that if an arbitrage condition exists, then the pollster is wrong and should not have made that prediction in the first place. Still, it’s not obvious that there’s an arbitrage condition within Silver’s predictions yet (remember, the trader doesn’t have access to an oracle, and only has the same information available to him as the pollster). There’s two more building blocks that we need in order to establish an arbitrage condition.</p>


<p>To paraphrase Taleb, if I tell you an event has a 0% chance of occurring, I cannot change my mind and tell you tomorrow it now has a 50% chance of occurring. Otherwise I shouldn’t have told you it has a 0% chance in the first place. Probability and confidence are inextricably linked, and the number a pollster predicts should encapsulate both. To go to the other extreme, if the uncertainty is extremely high (and therefore confidence low), <em>it does not matter what the polls today are saying</em>. I should give both candidates a 50% chance of winning, because I am admitting the extremely likely possibility that an external event will happen that will invalidate today’s polls. To put it in technical terms, maximum uncertainty implies maximum entropy, and the maximum entropy distribution on the [0, 1] interval is the uniform distribution, which has a mean at .5. The following figure (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06351.pdf">this paper</a>) shows the relationship between probability (x-axis) and volatility (y-axis) under a specific option pricing formulation.
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/confidence-probability.png" alt="Confidence vs volatility"></p>

<p>At this point we are suspecting something doesn’t look right with FiveThirtyEight’s predictions, as they seem to have both high volatility and high probability, which contradict each other. Where is the threshold though? How can we prove that the volatility is too high?</p>


<p>Now we’re going to go a little bit technical and show that a no-arbitrage condition was likely violated. The basic construction is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In order to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition, all information must be “priced in” into the pollster’s current prediction.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the time series of predictions must be a martingale.</li>
  <li>Martingales cannot show trending or mean-reverting behavior, therefore Silver’s predictions violated the martingale property, and therefore the no-arbitrage condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>The definition of a martingale is a stochastic process \(X_1, X_2, ... X_t\) that satisfies</p><p>

\[E[X_{t+1} | X_1, ... ,X_t] = X_t\]

</p><p>To quote <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Wlezien/publication/344419648_Information_incentives_and_goals_in_election_forecasts/links/5f73c994a6fdcc0086484861/Information-incentives-and-goals-in-election-forecasts.pdf">Andrew Gelman</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In non-technical terms, the martingale property says that knowledge of the past will be of no use in predicting the future…One implication of this is
that it should be unlikely for forecast probabilities to change too much during the campaign (Taleb, 2017). Big events can still lead to big changes in the forecast: for example, a series of polls with Biden or Trump doing much better than before will translate into an inference that public opinion has shifted in that candidate’s favor. The point of the martingale property is not that this cannot happen, but that the possibility of such shifts should be anticipated in the model, to an amount corresponding to their prior probability. If large opinion shifts are allowed with high probability, then there should be a correspondingly wide uncertainty in the vote share forecast a few months before the election, which in turn will lead to win probabilities closer to 50%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, all information is already priced into the current market. If it were not so, a trader could make money by taking advantage of the information that is not priced in already. So last thing we need to check: is it likely that Silver’s predictions have the martingale property? It is not in dispute that the answer is no…it shows clear mean-reversion behavior and can be validated by a statistical test of the martingale hypothesis (for example, a <a href="http://www.planchet.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/35822efeb009804cc1257afe006b0063/$FILE/11park.pdf">Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</a>). It seems that Taleb’s math is sound here. So where did he go wrong?</p>


<p>I believe Nate Silver is answering a subtly different question with his election forecasts. Each data point that Silver produces is answering the question: <em>if the election were to happen today</em>, what is the probability of each candidate winning? I argue that this is a valid and useful formulation. To put it slightly differently: if the question is “Who will win the election on Nov. 3?”, which of the following answers is more satisfying?</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If nothing else changes between now and the election, Joe Biden has a 85% chance of winning.” (Silver’s argument)</li>
  <li>“I dunno, anything could happen between now and the election, I give neither candidate chances much more than 50%.” (Taleb’s argument)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a valid criticism that perhaps Silver is not very clear on explaining what his numbers represent, and therefore the media misreports his predictions. Still, I wager that most people would find the first answer more useful. In this interpretation, the “financial instrument” is a binary option that expires every day. Thefore the time series of Silver’s predictions is not interpretable as a martingale, as it strings together the price of a completely different instrument every day.</p>

<p>It is also a valid criticism that Silver’s predictions prior to Nov. 3 mean absolutely nothing, whereas in the Taleb formulation it has a natural interpretation as the betting odds for each candidate. Silver has explicitly stated that he only judges his models based on his finalized prediction. To that end, his models are extremely well calibrated, i.e., when he says something has a 50% chance of happening it actually does happen 50% of the time.
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/538-calibration.png" alt="538 calibration"></p>

<p>In conclusion, Taleb and Silver should be having a philosophical debate on what pollsters’ numbers actually mean, and stay away from the useless distraction of calling each other names on Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Anyone trying to understand DRM (Digital Rights Management) will be confronted with acronyms such as AES, CDM, CENC, EME, etc. This can get very confusing for a newcomer, but understanding them is important to get a good understanding of DRM. In this article, let’s take a gentle tour of the building blocks of DRM:- EME, CDM, AES, CENC, and the use of Keys &amp; Key Servers.</strong></p>








<h2 id="simplified-architecture-of-a-drm-system"><span id="Simplified_Architecture_of_a_DRM_System"></span>Simplified Architecture of a DRM System<span></span></h2>



<p>As we saw&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-drm-digital-rights-management/">in the previous article</a>,&nbsp;<strong>DRM is a combination of encryption and business rules to control access and consumption of digital content.</strong></p>



<p>Simply put, DRM is a system that,</p>



<ul><li>provides the tools and infrastructure to enable a content provider to encrypt their content, and</li><li>build an ecosystem around the encrypted content so that the content provider can control who/what can decrypt and consume their content.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-drm-digital-rights-management/">In the previous article of the series</a>, we saw Ram and Shyam sending coded messages to each other. At the same time, Hari maintained the codebooks and decided who got to read/write the notes – remember?</p>

<p>Now, let’s take this simple system and replace it with the technology needed to secure and distribute video. What do we get?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="138" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/step-0/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=1396%2C818&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1396,818" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="step-0" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="600" src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="aes-cenc-cdm-eme-keys" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1200%2C703&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?w=1396&amp;ssl=1 1396w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Let’s describe what we have here. There is a movie that we want to send to an authenticated user securely.</p>



<p>So,</p>



<ol><li>we ask a DRM company’s server for a codebook to encrypt our video,</li><li>then, we encrypt the video using that codebook</li><li>we send the movie to the user.</li><li>the user then asks the DRM company’s server for the codebook to unlock the video (decrypt it)</li><li>and then he watches the movie!</li></ol>



<p>Fantastic!</p>



<p>Is this all there is to know about DRM for video?</p>



<p>Nope! What we have here is a simple, toy-example of how to transfer movies securely using DRM. It captures the essence of DRM perfectly but wouldn’t work well in the real world.</p>



<p>In the rest of this article, let’s take each piece of this simple system, re-think it, re-design it, and see how it fits within the world of video delivery and DRM, shall we?</p>



<h2 id="step-0-lets-move-to-adaptive-bitrate-streaming"><span id="Step_0_Let%E2%80%99s_Move_to_Adaptive_Bitrate_Streaming"></span>Step 0: Let’s Move to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming<span></span></h2>



<p>Before we talk about the order, let’s modify our example to suit the ABR (<strong>A</strong>daptive&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>it<strong>R</strong>ate) model of video delivery.</p>



<p><strong>ABR Refresher:</strong>&nbsp;in ABR, a movie is encoded into different bitrate-resolution combinations&nbsp;<em>(a.k.a ladder)</em>&nbsp;and then split into&nbsp;<strong>chunks or segments</strong>. Each chunk represents a few seconds of video and it is independently decodable.</p>



<p><strong>“Packaging”</strong>&nbsp;refers to chunking or breaking up a movie into small pieces and describing it in a manifest or playlist document. When the user wants to play the movie, he needs to refer to this manifest.</p>



<p>Depending on the available bandwidth, the player requests a chunk/segment of a particular bitrate&nbsp;<em>(rendition, or rung of the ladder)</em>&nbsp;and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) responds with the requested chunk.</p>



<p>Popular methods of video delivery using ABR are MPEG DASH and HLS. For a deeper understanding, please refer to our articles on&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-ott-video-streaming/">OTT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-abr-video-streaming/">ABR</a>&nbsp;video streaming.</p>



<p>Let’s change our block digram to reflect ABR video delivery.</p>

<p>The only changes here are the packaging and CDN-based delivery steps. That’s all.</p>



<p>Okay, let’s move on and start with the encryption process.</p>



<h2 id="step-1-video-encryption"><span id="Step_1_Video_Encryption"></span>Step 1: Video Encryption<span></span></h2>



<p>The whole idea of encryption is to ensure that when someone intercepts our data, they should not read it or watch it in the case of video.</p>



<p><strong>Encryption refresher:</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em>encryption is a technique used to keep data confidential and prevent unauthorized people from reading it. Encryption uses a “key” to convert input data (plaintext) into an alternate form called ciphertext. It is almost impossible to convert the ciphertext back to plaintext without the key.</em></p>



<p><em>However, practically speaking, decryption without the key is possible, and encryption algorithms are designed make reverse-engineering extremely expensive – in terms of time, money, and computing resources needed.</em></p>



<p>One of the most popular encryption techniques is the “Advanced Encryption Standard” or “AES” for short. It is also called Rijndael (after its inventor) and was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 to encrypt electronic data.</p>



<p>Some important points to remember about AES:-</p>



<ul><li>It’s a&nbsp;<strong>symmetric-key algorithm</strong>: encryption and decryption are performed using the same key.</li><li>It has three variants based on the key-length: 128, 192, and 256 bits. The longer the key, the harder it is to crack.</li><li>Cracking the AES-128 without the key would require a “billion times a billion years” and a super-computer (<a href="https://www.eetimes.com/how-secure-is-aes-against-brute-force-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>).</li></ul>



<p>If you are interested in going deep into the AES standard, look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AES’s Wikipedia page</a>.&nbsp;<em>I am not an expert in cryptography and won’t be able to do justice to the AES.</em></p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Please remember that&nbsp;<strong>encryption is not encoding, and decryption is not decoding in the video space</strong>. For videos, encoding and decoding are words used to refer to compression and decompression, respectively. To learn more about encoding, decoding, and video codecs, please read our articles on&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">the need for compression</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-a-video-codec/">simple introduction to video codecs</a>.</p>



<h3 id="is-aes-128-the-only-encryption-technique"><span id="Is_AES128_The_Only_Encryption_Technique"></span>Is AES-128 The Only Encryption Technique?<span></span></h3>



<p>No, it isn’t, and let’s think about the implication of this for a minute.</p>



<p>If a content provider decides to engage with three different DRM companies, and all three use different encryption techniques, then it means that the content provider needs to encrypt their videos three times, resulting in a waste of storage space and other resources.</p>



<p>That is why the CENC specification came into being – to reduce this encryption-driven fragmentation of the market and to reduce storage requirements.</p>



<p>Let’s learn about this next.</p>



<h3 id="cenc-or-common-encryption"><span id="CENC_or_Common_Encryption"></span>CENC or Common Encryption<span></span></h3>



<p><strong>Actually, before we dive into CENC, let’s step back and take a look at the state of OTT streaming protocols and CMAF in particular.</strong></p>



<p>There are primarily two protocols in use today – MPEG-DASH and HLS.&nbsp;<em>There are others such as MSS (Microsoft Smooth Streaming) and HDS, but, we’ll leave them aside for this discussion.</em></p>



<p>MPEG-DASH uses the&nbsp;<code>mp4</code>&nbsp;container format for its videos and HLS uses the MPEG-TS (<code>ts</code>) container for its files. If a content provider uses both MPEG-DASH and HLS, then they need to store a copy of their videos in both&nbsp;<code>mp4</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ts</code>&nbsp;file formats.</p>



<p>Now, let’s add the DRM encryption problem to it. If our three hypothetical DRM providers use three different encryption standards, then a content providers needs to store&nbsp;<code>2 * 3</code>&nbsp;… six copies of each video! What a waste of storage space!!</p>



<p><strong>To combat the first problem posed by video streaming protocols, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-a/common-media-application-format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMAF</a>&nbsp;specification was created</strong> which said that videos can be stored in the&nbsp;<strong>fragmented mp4</strong>&nbsp;container format (<code>fmp4</code>). With support from both MPEG-DASH and HLS, you can now create only one set of videos, store it in&nbsp;<code>fmp4</code>&nbsp;format, and use a common set of files for both protocols. </p>



<p><strong>Just make sure you create two manifests (sigh!).</strong></p>



<h3><span id="How_About_Unifying_the_Encryption"></span><strong>How About Unifying the Encryption?</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>We still need to store multiple copies of each file if different DRM technologies use different encryption standards, right?</p>



<p>For this purpose, the MPEG developed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENC or Common Encryption specification</a>, specifying that videos can be encrypted using either&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;(AES-128 CTR) or&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;(AES-128 CBC).&nbsp;<em>CTR stands for Counter; and CBC stands for Cipher Block Chaining.</em></p>



<p>The implication of CENC is that a content provider needs to encrypt his videos only once and any decryption module can decrypt it.&nbsp;<em>Note: Exposing the encryption algorithm is not a problem as long as the keys are strongly protected.</em></p>



<p><strong>Well, CENC might sound like a magic wand for DRM-unification, but it is not.</strong></p>



<p>There are three primary DRM technologies in the market – Apple FairPlay, Google Widevine, and Microsoft PlayReady.</p>



<ul><li>Apple FairPlay supports only AES-CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;mode.</li><li>HLS supports only AES-CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;mode (irrespective of CMAF)</li><li>Widevine and PlayReady support both AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;or AES-128 CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;modes.</li><li>MPEG-DASH with CMAF supports both AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;or AES-128 CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;modes.</li><li>MPEG-DASH without CMAF supports only AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;mode.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, the CMAF and CENC specs have lead to confusion and fragmentation in the streaming space. </p>



<p><strong>A possible convergence point is the universal use of CMAF and AES-CBC&nbsp;cbcs&nbsp;mode, but, how will these impact legacy devices that support only CTR or only MPEG-TS?</strong></p>



<p>That’s a discussion for another time.</p>



<h2 id="step-2-key-keyid-and-the-license-server"><span id="Step_2_Key,_KeyID,_and_the_License_Server"></span>Step 2: Key, KeyID, and the License Server<span></span></h2>



<p>By now, we have established that we will be encrypting or videos using AES-128 bit encryption. At this stage, a few questions that come up are –</p>



<ol><li>Where do we get the AES-128 Encryption Keys?</li><li>How do we associate an Encryption Key with a movie?</li><li>Where do we store the Encryption Keys?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s answer them one at a time.</p>



<h3 id="where-do-we-get-the-aes-128-bit-encryption-keys"><span id="Where_do_we_get_the_AES128_bit_encryption_keys"></span>Where do we get the AES-128 bit encryption keys?<span></span></h3>



<p>Any content provider can generate the encryption keys manually using specialized software. Alternatively, several DRM vendors provide the necessary tools and software to generate these keys.</p>



<h3 id="how-do-we-associate-an-encryption-key-with-a-movie"><span id="How_do_we_associate_an_encryption_key_with_a_movie"></span>How do we associate an encryption key with a movie?<span></span></h3>



<p>Let’s understand the “why” first. When you go to a hotel, you ask the receptionist for the keys to a particular room by mentioning the room number – right? You’re providing the association here between a key and a room by telling her the room number.</p>



<p>Similarly, when we encrypt a movie with a particular key, we need to create that association and provide that to the DRM license server&nbsp;<em>(our receptionist, if you will)</em>.</p>



<p>In DRM, a “<strong>KeyID</strong>” provides the association between an encryption key and a movie. It is a&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;string of characters generated at the time of creating an encryption key for a particular movie.</p>

                    <p><em>Part of a 3 part series. Followups on <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/">Rust</a></em></p><p>I built the first demo of Dark in Python, in about two weeks. A few months later when I started productizing it, I rebuilt it in OCaml. Back in 2017, when I was considering the language and platform to use for Dark, OCaml was extremely compelling:</p><ul><li>it's a high-level language with static types, so easy to make large scale changes as we figure out what the language/product was</li><li>you mostly model data with sum types, which in my mind are the best way to model data</li><li>it's very similar to the language I wanted to build (in particular, we could reuse built-in immutable data structures for Dark's values)</li><li>it had a reputation for being high-performance, which meant that we could write an interpreter for Dark and not have it be terribly slow (vs writing an interpreter in python, which might be too slow)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as we've built Dark we've run into significant problems that have made it challenging to build in OCaml.</p><h2 id="lack-of-libraries">Lack of libraries</h2><p>When you bet on an off-mainstream language, one of the things you accept is that many libraries are not going to be available. When there is a small community, often there aren't enough people working in the language to make important libraries. This is especially true if few people are building business applications.</p><p>In OCaml there are many high quality libraries, especially for data structures and data manipulation. The annual<a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/"> Jane Street code dump</a> has been quite useful and very high quality. However, we really felt the lack of several libraries. The most obvious of these is that we had to build a <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libexecution/unicode_string.mli">Unicode string library</a> ourselves (built on top of the <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/uuseg">very impressive OCaml Unicode libraries</a> built by <a href="https://erratique.ch/contact.en">Daniel Bünzli</a>), but we needed many more libraries than that.</p><p>The lack of an SDK for Google Cloud has affected us greatly. When you're searching for product-market fit, you do the simplest, easiest thing. If you lack a good SDK for your cloud provider, the simplest, easiest thing is often a terrible architectural choice. We've built our own queue on top of our database rather than using the production-quality cloud queues available on GCP. Similarly, we barely use the Cloud Storage (GCP's version of S3), because we initially put things in the database <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/evolving-darks-tracing-system/">because it was easier</a>. We've built 3 services, 2 <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/stroller">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/queue-scheduler">Rust</a>, and 1 in <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/postgres-honeytail">Go</a>, to workaround the challenges we've faced.</p><p>The biggest challenge here is our use of Postgres. Postgres is a great database and we're big fans, but Cloud SQL is not a great hosted database. GCP's position is that Cloud SQL is there to tick a box and we should be using Cloud Spanner. I would love to switch to Cloud Spanner, but we have no driver for it in OCaml. Given the Postgres driver in OCaml is not particularly mature, it's hard to expect that a Cloud Spanner driver would exist, and indeed it doesn't. We've had to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/mmottl/postgresql-ocaml/commit/81a4ae5240decd8f483a90568257cfbc1558c7ed">OCaml Postgres driver</a>, and some parts of our codebase have been <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libbackend/serialize.ml#L226">well and truly mangled</a> when working around features not supported in that driver.</p><p>We've also suffered from a lack of a high-level, production web stack (there are <a href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/ocaml-h2">low-level stacks with good reputations</a> that I've struggled to use, and a <a href="https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/reason-native-web/morph">new</a> ones out there that look good), in particular lacking a user authentication module. We've been using <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> to work around this for now, which has more moving pieces than I'd like, and a shockingly high cost (our 7000 users, most of whom never log in, costs us over $500/mo).</p><p>We've worked around other missing vendor SDKs by calling their HTTP endpoints directly and that's been mostly fine. However, for libraries like encryption we don't have that option - we <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1455/files">hacked around a missing encryption library</a>, but decided not to ship it to production until we audited it for security (which was never actually worth the cost).</p><p>At CircleCI, we bet on Clojure. That was also a non-mainstream language, but its ability to call Java SDKs meant we had a mature cloud library, which was essential for building CircleCI. Of course, in OCaml we could call C libraries (and <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1841">even Rust libraries</a>, perhaps), but it doesn't match having native libraries we can call directly.</p><h2 id="learnability">Learnability</h2><p>I'm mostly in the camp that anyone can learn any language, but I saw a team struggle with OCaml, and for good reason. Language tutorials are extremely poor in OCaml compared to other languages; they're mostly lecture notes from academic courses.</p><p>The compiler isn't particularly helpful, certainly compared to Rust or Elm (both of which have been in our stack at one point). Often it gives no information about an error. Syntax errors typically say "Syntax error"; though it will try to give a good error for a mismatched brace, often incorrectly. Type errors can be a real burden to read, even after 3 years of experience with it.</p><p>The docs in OCaml are often challenging to find. The <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/base/index.html">Jane Street docs</a> have improved significantly in the last few years, but it can be a challenge to even figure out what functions are available in a particular module for most libraries. Compare to the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a> in Rust, which has comprehensive API docs for every package in Rust.</p><p>One of the ways I personally struggled in OCaml is around <code>Lwt</code>. Lwt is (one of!) OCaml's async implementations. I couldn't figure it out several years ago and so just built a single-threaded server. The amount of workarounds and downtime we've suffered from that single decision is immense. A tutorial around building high-performance (or even medium performance!) web servers would be very valuable. </p><p>Tooling is something I read would be good in OCaml. I remember reading there was a debugger that could go back in time! I don't know where that's gone but I've never heard of anyone using it.</p><p>We have struggled to make editor tooling work for us. This is partially because we also use ReasonML and this seems to break things. Unfortunately, this is common in programming, but even more so in small communities: you might be the first person to ever try to use a particular configuration.</p><p>Finally, the disconnect between the various tools is immense. You need to understand Opam, Dune, and Esy, to be able to get something working (you could also do it without Esy and just rely on Opam, but that's much worse). I talked about a bunch of these challenges <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="language-problems">Language problems</h2><p>Multicore is coming Any Day Now™️, and while this wasn't a huge deal for us, it was annoying. </p><h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2><p>One of my biggest annoyances was how often OCaml folks talk about Fancy Type System problems, instead of how to actually build products and applications. In other communities for similar languages (ReasonML, Elm, F#), people talk about building apps and solving their problems. In OCaml, it feels like people spend an awful lot of time discussing Functors. It's not quite at the level that I perceived in the Haskell world, but it pointed out that the people building the core of the ecosystem do not have the same problems that I do (which is building web-y stuff).</p><p>I honestly think OCaml was a great choice at the start. Being able to quickly and safely make large-scale changes to your app is something that staticly-typed functional languages excel at. I'm happy that we made the choice, and in retrospect, it still seems like the best choice of those we had at the time.</p><p>I'm working on building the next version of the backend. We have about 20k lines to be replaced, and they'll be rewritten in a new language while keeping the semantics the same. I plan to leave keep the frontend in ReasonML: it doesn't suffer from the same library problems as it can interface nicely to JS, and it's nearly 50k lines of code so it would be a much bigger undertaking.</p><p>Read <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">the followup</a> to see what we picked!</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>If you’re like most people, there’s a good chance that it’s been years since you’ve sent an email that wasn’t cryptographically signed. You don’t use PGP, you say? Well, even if <em>you</em> are not signing your email, your provider is almost certainly doing it for you. Plausible deniability has been tossed aside in the name of stopping spam, but it doesn’t have to be.</p> <p><span data-title="DomainKeys Identified Mail"><abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr></span>, originally standardized in 2007 by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4871.html">RFC 4871</a>, now has near universal<a href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a> adoption. To quote the RFC, the goal behind the protocol is to “permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message signer identity and the integrity of the messages they convey”. It’s one of several technologies used prevent the sender identity information in email from being spoofed<a href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>. Anti-spam systems use it to help determine whether to consider the reputation of a domain name when making a processing decision.</p> <p>While <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr> was designed to be useful for spam prevention, the cryptographic signatures it uses have quietly made a property called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation">non-repudiation</a>” the new normal for email. The term is used in in contract law — for example if someone claims “that’s not my signature”, they could be said to be “repudiating” the authenticity of the document. In the case of email, the impact is that if you have a copy of an email in its original format including full headers (for example, an email spool dump) you can check the signature. The extent to which this is a reliable means of verification varies depending on the circumstances — keys short enough to be cracked used to be common, and in some cases straight-up theft of the private keys is plausible.</p> <p>Meanwhile, secure messaging tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging">OTR</a> and its successors have taken the approach of explicitly providing “deniable encryption”. The <a href="https://signal.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/#potential-simplifications-and-improvements">state of the art</a> allows a sender, given a recipient’s public key, to craft a fake transcript apparently between the two of them that will pass cryptographic checks. This is generally fine for users of these apps because they know what they said. To the best of my knowledge, there is nowhere this creates a legal “get out of jail free” card. All it really does is ensure the users of these tools aren’t <em>reducing</em> their deniability by using the tool. This is an issue where <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr> really fails its users, and I’m apparently not the only one that feels this way.</p> <blockquote> <p>Apropos of nothing, I really wish Gmail would start publishing its expired DKIM secret keys.</p> <p>—<a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1323011619069321216">Matthew Green</a></p> </blockquote> <p>A little over three years ago, I started doing exactly that for my domain. Since then, I’ve had a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ryancdotorg/a8f565b9e4f0902eb7b5cd4cdefeea0f">key rotation script</a> running every day, generating a new key and adding the appropriate record (called a “selector”).</p> <div><pre><span></span><code>20170829-<wbr>b29b2444f764c222c3faf5c.<wbr>_domainkey.<wbr>ryanc.<wbr>org.<wbr> 5 <wbr>IN <wbr>TXT <wbr>"<wbr>v=<wbr>DKIM1;<wbr>t=<wbr>s;<wbr>h=<wbr>sha256;<wbr>p=<wbr>MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDkOSIRW7R8a3e0J0lZqbBJSpHJYPk043/<wbr>OB3lcT2apKtnu7MLjIRqUAgRyYSVAGC10ID2Qlxmy1Ji3EBRB1qI2IsNKgC2C4qzGxx54ShpVR/<wbr>8yY9Qy1eyNtTF5Y/<wbr>XSoLWoRVO1oly+<wbr>WL+<wbr>4O2TRuyujEwoZcFUwXzuuuqJtzbI17wIDAQAB"<wbr>

</code></pre></div> <p>When I originally set this up, I was a bit concerned that I’d run into issues with filtering systems trying to validate my sent emails significantly after delivery. Per the RFC:</p> <blockquote> A signer should not sign with a private key when the selector containing the corresponding public key is expected to be revoked or removed before the verifier has an opportunity to validate the signature. The signer should anticipate that verifiers may choose to defer validation, perhaps until the message is actually read by the final recipient. In particular, when rotating to a new key pair, signing should immediately commence with the new private key and the old public key should be retained for a reasonable validation interval before being removed from the key server.</blockquote> <p>In the process of writing this up, I went through the 24 months of query logs I have. With very few exceptions (most of which were probably my own testing) there were no lookups against selectors other than on the day they were being used, so this doesn’t seem to be a problem in practice.</p> <p>I alluded to it earlier, but I want to be clear — publishing <abbr title="DomainKeys Identified Mail">DKIM</abbr> private keys like this mainly addresses leaks as a threat model.

Even in my case, where I have my own mail server on dedicated hardware with full disk encryption at an undisclosed location, most mail I send will be delivered to a server operated by a third party with no incentive to alter logs at the behest of the recipient.</p> <p>It would make for a fascinating experiment for one of the privacy focused email providers to try deploying a key management strategy similar to the one I’ve described in this post.</p> <table id="id4"> <colgroup><col><col></colgroup> <tbody> <tr><td><a href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>I can’t find any recent public data on this, but Google reported that 87.6% of non-spam emails received by Gmail users had valid DKIM signatures as of Febuary 2016. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2013/12/internet-wide-efforts-to-fight-email.html">https://security.googleblog.com/2013/12/internet-wide-efforts-to-fight-email.html</a></td></tr> </tbody> </table> <table id="id5"> <colgroup><col><col></colgroup> <tbody> <tr><td><a href="#id2">[2]</a></td><td>The core protocol behind email, <span data-title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"><abbr title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</abbr></span> was designed in the early eighties, and one of the terms it uses is “envelope sender”.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="UK-CIC logo" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="8a702f0f-0ed4-43c4-b10a-d98dba34a018" src="https://www.uk-cic.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/UK-CIC%20logo%20square%20300pix.jpg">Cellular (T cell) immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be present within most adults six months after primary infection, a new pre-print on bioRxiv suggests. The research from the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (UK-CIC), Public Health England and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust&nbsp;demonstrates robust T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus peptides at this timepoint in all participants following asymptomatic or mild/moderate COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>A key question is whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in immunity to reinfection, and if so for how long. The immune system is extremely complex and there are many different potential routes whereby it can generate immunity to a disease post-infection. This study examines the role of T cells in contributing to immunity against SARS-CoV-2 at six months post infection.</p>

<p>As part of UK-CIC, researchers from the University of Birmingham, Public Health England, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) and&nbsp;NIHR Manchester Clinical Research Facility collected serum and blood samples from a cohort of more than 2,000 clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers including 100 individuals who tested sero-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March/April 2020 (average age 41 (range 22–65); 23 men, 77 women). All 100 individuals experienced either mild/moderate symptoms or were asymptomatic (56 versus 44 people) and none were hospitalised for COVID-19. Serum samples were collected monthly to measure antibody levels, and blood samples were taken after six months to assess the cellular (T cell) response. A range of analyses were carried out to assess different aspects of the T cell response including the magnitude of response and the response to different proteins from SARS-CoV-2. Carrying out these cellular analyses is much more complex than antibody studies – but this study of 100 individuals is one of the largest in the world to date in this field.</p>

<p>T cell responses were present in all individuals at six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cellular immune response was directed against a range of proteins from the virus, including the Spike protein that is being used in most vaccine studies. However, comparable immunity was present against additional proteins, such as nucleoprotein, which suggests that these may be of value for incorporation in future vaccine protocols. This indicates that a robust cellular memory against the virus persists for at least six months.</p>

<p>The size of T cell response differed between individuals, being considerably (50%) higher in people who had experienced symptomatic disease at the time of infection six months previously. Further research will be needed to determine the significance of this finding. It is possible that heightened cellular immunity might provide increased protection against re-infection in people with initial symptomatic infection, or that asymptomatic individuals are simply able to fight off the virus without the need to generate a large immune response.</p>

<p>Antibodies are also a crucial component of immune defence and cellular immunity was strongly correlated with the peak level of the antibody response. Furthermore, larger cellular responses appeared to protect against antibody ‘waning’ over time, again suggesting the need to ensure that cellular immune responses are elicited in vaccine regimens.</p>

<p>Overall, these findings indicate a robust cellular (T cell) immune response against SARS-CoV-2 at six months post-infection. These findings will feed not only into our understanding of how immunity to SARS-CoV-2 works but also help inform future vaccine strategies. Further research is now needed to assess whether this immune response is maintained over the longer term and to better understand how strength of cellular immune response corresponds to likelihood of reinfection.</p>



<p><b>Professor Paul Moss, UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium lead from University of Birmingham, said:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Understanding what constitutes effective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important, both to allow us to understand how susceptible individuals are to reinfection and to help us develop more effective COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>“To our knowledge, our study is the first in the world to show robust cellular immunity remains at six months after infection in individuals who experienced either mild/moderate or asymptomatic COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that cellular immunity is stronger at this time point in those people who had symptomatic infection compared with asymptomatic cases. We now need more research to find out if symptomatic individuals are better protected against reinfection in the future.</p>

<p>“Our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection is increasing all the time. While our findings cause us to be cautiously optimistic about the strength and length of immunity generated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, this is just one piece of the puzzle. There is still a lot for us learn before we have a full understanding of how immunity to COVID-19 works. While we increase our understanding, whether we think we have previously had COVID-19 or not, we all should still follow Government guidelines on social distancing to ensure we play our part in minimising the spread of COVID-19 within our communities.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><b>Dr Shamez Ladhani, Consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England and the study’s author, said:</b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Cellular immunity is a complex but potentially very significant piece of the COVID-19 puzzle, and it’s important that more research be done in this area. However, early results show that T-cell responses may outlast the initial antibody response, which could have a significant impact on COVID vaccine development and immunity research.</p>

<p>“Our thanks go to the more than 2,000 staff who have volunteered to provide monthly blood samples since the beginning of the pandemic. Recruiting donors so early in 2020 allowed us significantly longer follow-up than many similar studies have achieved so far.”</p>


</blockquote>

<p><b>Professor Fiona Watt, Executive Chair of the Medical Research Council, part of UKRI, said: </b></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This study shows the benefit of funding world-leading immunologists through the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium. Researchers investigated whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in immunity to reinfection. They found that a robust cellular memory against the virus persists for at least six months. This is promising news – if natural infection with the virus can elicit a robust T cell response then this may mean that a vaccine could do the same.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Dr Shazaad Ahmad, Consultant Virologist at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) and Principal Investigator for the study at MFT, said:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As one of the leading NHS trusts for research and innovation, known for our strong track record of recruiting to studies, we were selected to rapidly enlist a cohort of healthcare workers to take part in this important research – and 1,200 MFT staff swiftly answered the call.</p>

<p>“The study was delivered at the NIHR Manchester Clinical Research Facilities at Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe Hospital (both part of MFT), which provide dedicated research space and highly-trained staff. I would like to say how grateful I am to my colleagues for continuing to deliver and participate in this study, as without them we would not be able to report the findings, which could have a huge global impact."<br>

        <p>Published on: 2020-11-02</p>
        
<p><em>Note: Some details of the stories in this article are slightly altered to protect the privacy of the companies I worked for</em></p>
<p>It's somewhat anecdotal, but in my work, I often encounter projects that seem to use highly inefficient infrastructure providers, from a cost perspective.</p>
<p>I usually point out that, based on a fairly unbiased hardware comparison, that they could save over half their budget by migrating, and am usually met with a series of almost canned answer about migrations being too difficult due to x,y,z.</p>
<h2>I - A representative comparison</h2>
<p>I will pick one of the "expensive" and one of the "cheap" server providers, chosen simply based on the fact that I've worked with them a lot, and compare two of their high~ish end servers.</p>
<p>I'm going to take 1 example from a cheap server provider OVH and a somewhat worst machine from AWS.</p>
<p>OVH offers <a href="https://us.ovh.com/us/order/dedicated/#/dedicated/configure-hg?product=~(dc~(gra~1)~planCode~%271901bhg~option~(~(planCode~%27cpu-2x6132-dual-2018v1~family~%27cpu~quantity~1)~(planCode~%27ram-768g-2666-dual-2018v1~family~%27ram~quantity~1)~(planCode~%27disk-960ssd-sata-2019~family~%27disk~quantity~8)))">this machine</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Intel Xeon Scalable Gold 6132 - 28c/56t - 2.6/3.7 GHz</li>
<li>768GB RAM DDR4 ECC 2666MHz</li>
<li>960GB SATA SSD</li>
<li>3 Gb/s internal and 1 Gb/s external free bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p>For $15,800/year (though it can be paid monthly)</p>
<p>For a close comparison, AWS offers their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/">4.16xlarge</a>. I'll try to figure out the exact hardware specs on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/memory-optimized-instances.html">this description</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R4 instances feature up to 64 vCPUs and are powered by two AWS-customized Intel XEON processors based on E5-2686v4 that feature high-memory bandwidth and larger L3 caches to boost the performance of in-memory applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically let's call it 2x E5-2686v4, though the "real" E5-2686v4 seems to have more cores (both real and virtual) than the AWS version, I'll give AWS the benefit of the doubt and say that their version is more or less the same. I'll also assume AWS's RAM is the same 2666MHz DDR4 EEC2 (basically the best you can get right now) though they don't specify this, but I'll be generous here.</p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 - 36c/72t - 2.3/3.0 GHz</li>
<li>488GB RAM DDR4 ECC 2666MHz</li>
<li>Storage paid for separately</li>
<li>Bandwith paid for separately</li>
</ul>
<p>For $37,282/year (paid hourly) or $25,771/year (paid upfront)</p>
<p>The OVH server has more memory, it comes with 1TB of very fast storage, and adding more storage is much cheaper than AWS EBS prices (+ you get the option for NVME SSDs connected via PCIe on all servers).</p>
<p>I chose two processors which are <em>fairly</em> similar but running a comparison is still hard. Unlike e.g. RAM, processors are much more synergistic, you can't just look at parameters like nr cores, cache size, and frequency to figure out how well they perform.</p>
<p>Still, these two seem to be pretty close on those parameters and when looking at <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/Intel-Xeon-E5-2686-v4-vs-Intel-Xeon-Gold-6132/2870vs3227">the benchmarks</a>. It seems that the Gold 6132 is marginally better than the E5-2684-v4. Granted, benchmarking server CPUs is hard, but still, I think it's fair to say that the former has at least a tiny advantage, even if somehow the E5-2684 performs worst of benchmarks than on "real tasks".</p>
<p>So we have 2 servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are in Paris</li>
<li>One has 768GB of RAM the other 488GB (58% of the first one) with the same specs</li>
<li>One has an extremely to slightly better CPU (let's say 10% better, a bit bellow the ~17% claimed by the benchmarks)</li>
<li>One has free bandwidth, the other one charges you for every single Kb of communication with the outside world (though at a fairly small sum)</li>
<li>One comes with 1TB of very fast NVME storage, for the other one you have to pay extra</li>
<li>One is paid monthly, the other one yearly or hourly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the first server, the one that is better in literally every way, costs ~16k/year... how much should the other one cost? Well, maybe 10, maybe 12, maybe 14?</p>
<p>I don't know, but the answer certainly shouldn't be "Almost twice as much at 26k/year", that's the kind of answer that indicates something is broken.</p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, AWS is ~1.6x times as expensive, but again, that's paid yearly. If we compare paid monthly to paid hourly (not exactly fair) we get 37k vs 16k, if we do some <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/">napkin math calculations</a> for equivalent storage cost (with equivalent speed via guaranteed iops) we easily get to ~3k/year extra. We have a 40k vs 16k difference, the AWS machine with the worst specs is 250% more expensive.</p>
<p>But whether the worst AWS machine is 160% or 250% as expensive as the OVH one is not the relevant question here, the question is why are we seeing those astronomical differences in terms of cost to being with.</p>
<p>We should consider there are hosting providers cheaper than OVH (e.g. scaleway, potentially online.net, and other such providers you never heard of). On the flip side of the coin, there are server providers such as digital oceans, GC, and Azure that can be more expensive than AWS.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<h2>II - Vendor lock-in hypothesis</h2>
<p>The easiest thing to do here is to cry vendor lock-in.</p>
<p>The story goes that you end up using firebase for authentication, then you hire a sysadmin / DevOps guy that knows GC to create your infrastructure there. Then you make use of some fancy google ML service that integrates seamlessly with the GC storage... so on and so forth, until it would cost you a lot more manpower to move away from GC than to pay them a bit extra for whatever compute or storage you could get for less elsewhere.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is compounded by the fact that most of the time startups are oblivious to the cost of these services.</p>
<p>I switched my personal "infrastructure" from AWS since it ended up costing me over $100/month to maintain. Nowadays I pay $23/month and get a lot more leeway out of my current setup. But I haven't done that with some startups I've worked with or advised, even though the cost savings could have one or two additional zeros added to them. Why?</p>
<p>I can often call the shots regarding hardware at the startups I've worked with, yet I usually can't argue against using AWS or GC... because often enough, the first hit is free. AWS, GC, and Azure are throwing out 10k$ worth of credits like candy, and topping that off with 50-200k$ worth of credit for startups that they think have potential. The catch here is that the credits expire in 1 year, and once that year is done many are probably locked into the vendor.</p>
<p>The startup model is one of exponential growth, most fail and the winners have dozens or hundreds of millions from investments. So what is one or two hundred thousand a year on an IaaS bill?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is almost nothing. I believe the standard AWS offering for free credits is something like 100k$/year. So assuming a startup that uses that for a year gets 10mil in investment, it costs them 1% of their budget a year to maintain that.</p>
<p>The problem is that investment reflects future potential worth, a startup receiving a 10 mil investment is probably operating at a small fraction of the capacity those investors hope it will reach. For the shares to be worth 5x time that original investment, the company might have to scale its operations 20x or 50x, or 100x.</p>
<p>This becomes a problem since you can't run on investment forever, and scaling up 20x suddenly turns that 100k into 2 million a year spent on servers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a hypothetical, the numbers here are stand-ins to make a point, not a case-study. From my own experience, that the lock-in funnel looks something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free credits, let's use {expensive infrastructure provider}.</li>
<li>Loads of investment money, let's not waste time switching away from {expensive infrastructure provider}, it's &lt; 1% of our yearly budget.</li>
<li>Turns out that once the company grew, {expensive infrastructure provider} now consists of a double-digit percentage of our yearly expenditure, but it's too late to switch now.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>This situation is exacerbated by consolidation (big fish buys little fish). I vividly remember a situation where I found an optimal hardware+software combination for a data processing platform, I think a conservative estimate would be that it was ~5 times cheaper than the vendor lock-in alternative being used at the time.</p>
<p>This happened to make it worth the switch since the startup lacked a generous credit offer for Google cloud. But, as soon as it was "consolidated", I was forced to switch the whole system back to Google cloud, granted a much better GC setup, but one that still involved costs ~2-3x times greater than the original solution.</p>
<p>Why? Well, boils down to the parent company using Google cloud, all their employees knowing how to work with GC, all their contracts having weird security-related clauses composed by many lawyers based on "official security audits" ran on their GC infrastructure, and so on.</p>
<p>However, this leads nicely into my second hypothesis.</p>
<h2>III - Employee lock-in hypothesis</h2>
<p>Employees end up deciding most of what a company is using internally, including infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>People aggregate <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">along weird lines</a>, to the extent that it wouldn't surprise me if a CTO hired initial engineers that favored his preferred infrastructure provider, even if he didn't actively seek that trait out.</p>
<p>Once the first few employees are fans of a given infrastructure provider, it starts making it into the job specs, because onboarding someone familiar with AWS when you use Azure is a huge pain in the ass. All other things being equal you'd rather have someone familiar with the technology you are already using.</p>
<p>This is compounded by the kind of employees that permeate a given field. If you are developing mobile apps or web apps, for example, it's likely that many engineers you will find will be familiar with Heroku and Digital Oceans. If you are developing whatever the heck people use C# for, I'd bet you'll find people that know how to use Azure. If you are doing machine learning, most people will know a thing or two about google cloud's offers regarding TPUs.</p>
<p>More broadly, this leaves no room for people that want to have a "multi-cloud" infrastructure or use a very little known platform. Either you get engineers that are very versed in the subject, but that will cost extra. Or you consign to having a few experts on the subject handle everything, with the rest of the team having no idea how to boot up a new VM without calling someone up.</p>

    <p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taipei.jpg" alt="Taipei"></p>

<p>Currently living in Taiwan, I recently joined the <a href="https://github.com/taiwangoldcard/taiwan-bot">Taiwan Bot 🤖</a> project along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-lim-0a307550">Shawn</a> and <a href="https://erickhun.com/about/">Eric</a>. The idea is to build a go-to assistant to help foreigners answer their questions about moving to, working, and living in Taiwan (pro-tip: ask the bot where to find cheese or chocolate).</p>

<p>Building a functional and useful chatbot is a non-trivial project. Fortunately, there has been impressive progress in the fields of machine learning and <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong> in the past few years. Moreover, the democratization and open-source sharing of cutting-edge deep learning models from research work at large tech companies like Google or Facebook is making it possible for anyone to implement the latest state-of-the-art solutions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/advances-in-semantic-textual-similarity.html">Universal Sentence Encoder</a>, recently released by Google AI, is one of these new models available via <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4">Tensorflow Hub</a>. Trained in a <strong>multi-tasking</strong> fashion, the model can encode sentences into meaningful continuous representations that work well on a range of different tasks. It is thus ideal for <strong>transfer learning</strong> and performs competitively with more complex models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT</a>. Moreover, it can run much faster than BERT or other similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)">Transformer</a> models and is thus more applicable to real-world problems. There is even a <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-lite/2">Lite version</a> of the model, small enough to run in Javascript on the client-side.</p>

<h2 id="the-project">The project</h2>

<p>Despite being an amazing place to live, <strong>Taiwan is still misunderstood by most foreigners</strong>. We think that a fun and approachable chatbot could help people understand a lot more about all the great things this place has to offer, as well as answer most of the questions they might have about living here.</p>

<p>We decided to start with a limited scope first and to focus on answering practical questions about moving to and living in Taiwan. Specifically, we chose to focus on visa issues and the recently created <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/">Gold Card program</a>. We plan to expand the bot capabilities in future versions.</p>

<p>When it comes to chatbots, there are a lot of ways to go, and many tools and libraries out there to help you make your plan a reality. However, being just a small team of 3 doing this in our spare time, we didn’t have enough resources and time to build something very sophisticated. We also didn’t want to spend a lot of time to compile a large training dataset. So we looked for the best way to build a system that would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🧩 Easy and quick to build</li>
  <li>⚡️ Lightweight and runnable on a small server</li>
  <li>🔧 Iterable and easy to improve</li>
  <li>🧠 Focused on finding relevant answers</li>
</ul>

<p>We chose to build our bot with Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk">Bot Framework SDK</a> for easy development, user management and to be able to easily publish it to multiple platforms like Messenger or Line, the most popular messaging platform in Taiwan. <strong>The only thing remaining was to build the brain behind the messages.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-meaning-behind-a-question">Understanding the meaning behind a question</h2>

<p>The main challenge when building a bot is <strong>relevancy</strong>, and this starts by having a clear understanding of what the user’s intention is. There are many approaches possible to make sense of what the user wants. At the most simple, one could simply look for some keywords such as <code>hello</code>, <code>restaurant</code>, or <code>visa</code>. However, this doesn’t take at all into account all the nuances of the language.</p>

<p>We didn’t have the resources to build a full-scale bot that could recognize the user intention among thousands of possibilities, yet we wanted to create something that could be relevant enough so that people would find it useful. So we needed to find an ideal middle ground between complexity and performance.</p>

<p>One of the most important concepts in NLP is one of <strong>distributed representations</strong>, inspired by the linguistic field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics">distributional semantics</a>. The core idea is to encode linguistic items (words, sentences) into <strong>embeddings</strong> (vectors in a large dimensional space) such that items with similar properties should be closer in the resulting space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall know a word by the company it keeps.</p>

  <p><em>- John Rupert Firth (1957)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, similar words will cluster together in the vector space:</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/word-embeddings.png" alt="Word Embeddings"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/08/introducing-semantic-reactor-explore-nlp-sheets.html">TensorFlow Blog</a></em></p>

<p>You could do the same as the above but with sentences, effectively encoding them into large vectors which can be compared between themselves using <strong>similarity functions</strong>. Hence sentences with similar vector representations are sentences with similar meaning, topic, syntax…</p>

<h2 id="encoding-questions-with-the-universal-sentence-encoder">Encoding questions with the Universal Sentence Encoder</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175">Universal Sentence Encoder</a> is a powerful Transformer model (in its large version) allowing to extract <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture">embeddings</a> directly from sentences instead of from individual words. It already powers some impressive Google projects such as <a href="https://books.google.com/talktobooks/">Talk to Books</a> or <a href="https://google.github.io/mysteryofthreebots/">Mystery of the Three Bots</a>.</p>

<p>For our chatbot project, we are first using the model to encode all the questions that we think users would want to ask to the bot. This can be done in a few lines of code thanks to the convenient TensorFlow Hub library:</p>

<p>Then whenever a user asks a question, we can just extract its embedding and find the most similar question in our database of embeddings. In our case we use a simple vector dot product as a similary function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>find_best_answer</span><span>(</span><span>question</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>embedding</span> <span>=</span> <span>model</span><span>([</span><span>question</span><span>,])</span>
    <span># compute dot product with each question:
</span>    <span>scores</span> <span>=</span> <span>questions_embeddings</span> <span>@</span> <span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>transpose</span><span>(</span><span>embedding</span><span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>answers</span><span>[</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>argmax</span><span>(</span><span>tf</span><span>.</span><span>squeeze</span><span>(</span><span>scores</span><span>).</span><span>numpy</span><span>())]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="google-sheets-as-a-collaborative-database">Google Sheets as a collaborative database</h2>

<p>We built our dataset using a simple Google spreadsheet with 2 columns: questions and answers. Whenever a user asks a question, we just find the most relevant question and return the appropriate answer.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-database.png" alt="Questions Answers Dataset"></p>

<p>This approach, while relatively simple, is a flexible enough for efficiently working together. Querying the data is done once during startup with a few lines of code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>gspread</span><span>.</span><span>authorize</span><span>(</span>
    <span>ServiceAccountCredentials</span><span>.</span><span>from_json_keyfile_dict</span><span>(</span><span>SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INFO_DICT</span><span>,</span>
        <span>[</span><span>'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds'</span><span>,</span><span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'</span><span>])</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>sheet</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>SPREADSHEET_FAQ_FILE</span><span>).</span><span>worksheet</span><span>(</span><span>SPREADSHEET_SHEET_NAME</span><span>)</span>
<span>questions</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>,</span> <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>col_values</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>:]))</span>
<span>answers</span> <span>=</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>.</span><span>strip</span><span>,</span> <span>sheet</span><span>.</span><span>col_values</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>:]))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is an example of a conversation with the bot:</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-conversation.jpg" alt="Conversation with the bot"></p>

<h2 id="continuous-improvement">Continuous improvement</h2>

<p>We did our best to think about what would be the most commonly asked questions but, of course, we cannot predict everything people will ask. This is why if you ask a question that is not present in our database, the bot can answer with something completely unrelated. To prevent this, we built a small logging system to be able to track the questions asked to the bot and which question it thought was the most similar (along with the similarity score).</p>

<p>For example, here is what happened behind the scenes during the small conversation above. The first column is the user message. The second column is the most similar question (as based on the embeddings similarity). The third column is the best answer and the last column the computed similarity score. If the similarity score is not good enough, the bot will answer with a generic reply <em>” Sorry, I cannot help with that yet “</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://jonathanbgn.com/assets/images/taiwan-bot-logs.png" alt="Conversation Logs"></p>

<p>This logging system will also help us improve our answers as more people use the bot and new edge cases are found. Still, no chatbot is perfect, and we think the bot will be most useful in a context where humans can take over when the bot fails. For example, on Slack, we added the bot to a general FAQ channel where people can get assistance from both the bot and humans for more specific information.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building an effective chatbot doesn’t have to be a complex project. As long as the scope is relatively narrow, it is possible to use a general encoder model like the Universal Sentence Encoder to build something useful. The hard part is collecting enough questions/answers for the bot to be able to answer most questions. It is also important to regularly monitor what users are asking and complement new data whenever the bot can’t find a relevant answer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, when I went from having only Facebook-login on <a href="https://wishy.gift/">Wishy.gift</a> to allow registrations with email address and password, one of my concerns was how to implement this is a way that protects the data and privacy of my users. I don’t have any ads or analytics on the site, the users can select whatever display name they want, and I never stored the email addresses I got from Facebook when a user registered or logged in - only a hashed<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> version of the ID. Email addresses and passwords, on the other hand, are a whole other beast, and the consequences of a database breach much worse.</p>
<p>Considering that the only kind of emails I ever need to send out are transactional - no newsletters or other kinds of notifications - the only thing I need to store them for are as identifiers, and can safely be hashed.</p>
<p>For every transactional email I need to send out - registration, account recovery, and email change verification - the user always initiates this by submitting their email address, and it will at that time be available to the backend to perform the needed action.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you only use email addresses for transactional emails, you might be able to only store hashed versions of them. For <a href="https://wishy.gift/">Wishy.gift</a> I use SHA512 with a fixed salt, and this has been working perfectly since implementation in June.</p>

<p>By Joe Byerly</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked directly for a battalion commander or above probably has experience writing “ghost notes.” These are emails a subordinate writes and addresses for their boss to send to other people. Ghost notes can be weekly or monthly sitreps, updates on an ongoing situation or emails asking for additional resources. No matter the type, they are the “easy button” for the commander because all they have to do is hit “send.”</p>
<p>Recently, I worked for a senior Army leader who encouraged his subordinate commanders to own their communications—meaning, write their own emails. As I reflected on his guidance, I realized there are benefits to communications ownership. I witnessed many of these benefits firsthand as I watched him communicate with senior military leaders, senior civilian leaders and his own commanders.</p>

<p><strong>Greatness and Writing</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to work through a problem is to write it down. Throughout history, leaders who found themselves in tough situations sat alone with their thoughts and worked through them using pen and paper.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius, who served as Roman emperor for almost two decades, wrote his <em>Meditations</em> to work through daily leadership challenges, wars and a pandemic. In the week leading up to the D-Day landings, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower wrote himself letters to help work through risks, opportunities and necessities of operations.</p>
<p>Both Marcus and Eisenhower used writing to achieve clarity of thought. This point is underscored by author Stephen King, who has said writing is “refined thinking.” In our minds, our thoughts are clear, but real clarity doesn’t come until those thoughts are solidified in writing. The process of framing an email, capturing important points and discarding nonessential elements helps us gain more clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Authentic</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I have worked under multiple commanders while in staff positions, and the best ones never let me draft their intent for operations orders. They wanted to own those. At the time, I didn’t understand it—thinking it was one more staff drill I could handle for them. But as I gained experience, I realized they wanted that section of the operations order to reflect their voice.</p>
<p>We all have a voice when we write. This voice is our certificate of authenticity. When commanders write their own correspondence, their voice comes through. When someone else drafts an email, using words and phrases the commander wouldn’t normally use, others can tell someone else wrote it.</p>
<p>Authenticity in communications is important for two reasons. First, subordinates will know if the intent, the guidance, the policy, etc., is the commander’s, or if it is another product produced by staff. They are more likely to follow it and adhere to it when they know it comes directly from the commander’s mind and is not a draft by a random staff officer.</p>
<p>Also, commanders who write their own communications tend to reinforce the message by repeating what they wrote. The senior Army leader I worked for occasionally wrote guidance that he sent out in an email. He then repeated key words and phrases from the document in meetings, during battlefield circulation and in one-on-one discussions. Everyone knew he wrote the email because he owned it and talked about it; his guidance didn’t become memorandums left on a bulletin board in a headquarters.</p>
<p>The second reason authenticity in communications is important is that it signals leader involvement in an issue. I have learned that many senior leaders can tell when a subordinate commander’s email is authentic or a staff-produced ghost note.</p>
<p>Every time there was a change or inflection point in the strategic situation, my boss would provide a one- or two-page update to his commanders. He always wrote these himself, for the reasons mentioned above. I found out from those commanders’ staff members that their bosses read these emails because they knew it was from him, and that if he took the time to write it, they should take the time to read it.</p>
<p>Communication can be frustrating. Sometimes it is like tapping out a song you have in your head and expecting another person to immediately know the tune. It is hard to convey an idea in your head to someone who may not have the same background or experiences as you, or who wasn’t in the same room when you had a conversation.</p>
<p>Communication is a skill that takes practice. We need repetition. Leaders who write their own emails gain needed communication experience when it matters. I have also learned that speed comes with practice. I can write in hours what used to take days.</p>
<p><strong>Honing the Skill</strong></p>
<p>I recognize that commanders have a lot on their plates, and it isn’t feasible for them to spend hours writing and responding to emails. There are many ghost notes best produced by staff in the interest of time. However, when it comes to communicating up or down the chain of command on key issues, or writing guidance on important topics, it is best for commanders to own those.</p>
<p>Great leaders are also great communicators, but the ability to communicate effectively and efficiently takes time to develop. By owning communications, commanders refine and hone this skill. They also have an opportunity to work through problems and refine their thinking through the process of writing. Finally, they gain authenticity in their communications—an important factor in ensuring that “message sent” is “message received.”</p>

<p>Haskell programmers spend a lot of time talking about <em>type safety</em>. The Haskell school of program construction advocates “capturing invariants in the type system” and “making illegal states unrepresentable,” both of which sound like compelling goals, but are rather vague on the techniques used to achieve them. Almost exactly one year ago, I published <a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, Don’t Validate</a> as an initial stab towards bridging that gap.</p>

<p>The ensuing discussions were largely productive and right-minded, but one particular source of confusion quickly became clear: Haskell’s <code>newtype</code> construct. The idea is simple enough—the <code>newtype</code> keyword declares a wrapper type, nominally distinct from but representationally equivalent to the type it wraps—and on the surface this <em>sounds</em> like a simple and straightforward path to type safety. For example, one might consider using a <code>newtype</code> declaration to define a type for an email address:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>EmailAddress</span> <span>=</span> <span>EmailAddress</span> <span>Text</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This technique can provide <em>some</em> value, and when coupled with a smart constructor and an encapsulation boundary, it can even provide some safety. But it is a meaningfully distinct <em>kind</em> of type safety from the one I highlighted a year ago, one that is far weaker. On its own, a newtype is just a name.</p>

<p>And names are not type safety.</p>
<!-- more-->



<p>To illustrate the difference between constructive data modeling (discussed at length in my <a href="http://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/08/13/types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types/">previous blog post</a>) and newtype wrappers, let’s consider an example. Suppose we want a type for “an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.” The natural constructive modeling would be an enumeration with five cases:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
  <span>=</span> <span>One</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Two</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Three</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Four</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Five</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>We could then write some functions to convert between <code>Int</code> and our <code>OneToFive</code> type:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>toOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>1</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>One</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>2</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Two</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>3</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Three</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>4</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Four</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>5</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>Five</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>One</span>   <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Two</span>   <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Three</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Four</span>  <span>=</span> <span>4</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>Five</span>  <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This would be perfectly sufficient for achieving our stated goal, but you’d be forgiven for finding it odd: it would be rather awkward to work with in practice. Because we’ve invented an entirely new type, we can’t reuse any of the usual numeric functions Haskell provides. Consequently, many programmers would gravitate towards a newtype wrapper, instead:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>=</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>Int</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Just as before, we can provide <code>toOneToFive</code> and <code>fromOneToFive</code> functions, with identical types:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>toOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>OneToFive</span>
<span>toOneToFive</span> <span>n</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>5</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>n</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span>        <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>(</span><span>OneToFive</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If we put these declarations in their own module and choose not to export the <code>OneToFive</code> constructor, these APIs might appear entirely interchangeable. Naïvely, it seems that the newtype version is both simpler and equally type-safe. However—perhaps surprisingly—this is not actually true.</p>

<p>To see why, suppose we write a function that consumes a <code>OneToFive</code> value as an argument. Under the constructive modeling, such a function need only pattern-match against each of the five constructors, and GHC will accept the definition as exhaustive:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>ordinal</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>One</span>   <span>=</span> <span>"first"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Two</span>   <span>=</span> <span>"second"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Three</span> <span>=</span> <span>"third"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Four</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"fourth"</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>Five</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"fifth"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The same is not true given the newtype encoding. The newtype is opaque, so the only way to observe it is to convert it back to an <code>Int</code>—after all, it <em>is</em> an <code>Int</code>. An <code>Int</code> can of course contain many other values besides <code>1</code> through <code>5</code>, so we are forced to add an error case to satisfy the exhaustiveness checker:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>ordinal</span> <span>::</span> <span>OneToFive</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span>
<span>ordinal</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>fromOneToFive</span> <span>n</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"first"</span>
  <span>2</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"second"</span>
  <span>3</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"third"</span>
  <span>4</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fourth"</span>
  <span>5</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>"fifth"</span>
  <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: bad OneToFive value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this highly contrived example, this may not seem like much of a problem to you. But it nonetheless illustrates a key difference in the guarantees afforded by the two approaches:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The constructive datatype captures its invariants in such a way that they are <em>accessible</em> to downstream consumers. This frees our <code>ordinal</code> function from worrying about handling illegal values, as they have been made unutterable.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>The newtype wrapper provides a smart constructor that <em>validates</em> the value, but the boolean result of that check is used only for control flow; it is not preserved in the function’s result. Accordingly, downstream consumers cannot take advantage of the restricted domain; they are functionally accepting <code>Int</code>s.</p></li></ul>

<p>Losing exhaustiveness checking might seem like small potatoes, but it absolutely is not: our use of <code>error</code> has punched a hole right through our type system. If we were to add another constructor to our <code>OneToFive</code> datatype,<sup><a href="#2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> the version of <code>ordinal</code> that consumes a constructive datatype would be immediately detected non-exhaustive at compile-time, while the version that consumes a newtype wrapper would continue to compile yet fail at runtime, dropping through to the “impossible” case.</p>

<p>All of this is a consequence of the fact that the constructive modeling is <em>intrinsically</em> type-safe; that is, the safety properties are enforced by the type declaration itself. Illegal values truly are unrepresentable: there is simply no way to represent <code>6</code> using any of the five constructors. The same is not true of the newtype declaration, which has no intrinsic semantic distinction from that of an <code>Int</code>; its meaning is specified extrinsically via the <code>toOneToFive</code> smart constructor. Any semantic distinction intended by a newtype is thoroughly invisible to the type system; it exists only in the programmer’s mind.</p>

<h2 id="revisiting-non-empty-lists">Revisiting non-empty lists</h2>

<p>Our <code>OneToFive</code> datatype is rather artificial, but identical reasoning applies to other datatypes that are significantly more practical. Consider the <code>NonEmpty</code> datatype I’ve repeatedly highlighted in recent blog posts:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>:|</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>It may be illustrative to imagine a version of <code>NonEmpty</code> represented as a newtype over ordinary lists. We can use the usual smart constructor strategy to enforce the desired non-emptiness property:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>

<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Foldable</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>toList</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Just as with <code>OneToFive</code>, we quickly discover the consequences of failing to preserve this information in the type system. Our motivating use case for <code>NonEmpty</code> was the ability to write a safe version of <code>head</code>, but the newtype version requires another assertion:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>toList</span> <span>xs</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
  <span>[]</span>  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This might not seem like a big deal, since it seems unlikely such a case would ever happen. But that reasoning hinges entirely on trusting the correctness of the module that defines <code>NonEmpty</code>, while the constructive definition only requires trusting the GHC typechecker. As we generally trust that the typechecker works correctly, the latter is a much more compelling proof.</p>



<p>If you are fond of newtypes, this whole argument may seem a bit troubling. It may seem like I’m implying newtypes are scarcely better than comments, albeit comments that happen to be meaningful to the typechecker. Fortunately, the situation is not quite that grim—newtypes <em>can</em> provide a sort of safety, just a weaker one.</p>

<p>The primary safety benefit of newtypes is derived from abstraction boundaries. If a newtype’s constructor is not exported, it becomes opaque to other modules. The module that defines the newtype—its “home module”—can take advantage of this to create a <em>trust boundary</em> where internal invariants are enforced by restricting clients to a safe API.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>NonEmpty</code> example from above to illustrate how this works. We refrain from exporting the <code>NonEmpty</code> constructor, and we provide <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> operations that we trust to never actually fail:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>module</span> <span>Data.List.NonEmpty.Newtype</span>
  <span>(</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>cons</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>nonEmpty</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>head</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>tail</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>where</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>

<span>cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span>
<span>cons</span> <span>x</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span>

<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
<span>nonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>$</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>xs</span>

<span>head</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span><span>_</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span>
<span>head</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>    <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>

<span>tail</span> <span>::</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
<span>tail</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>:</span><span>xs</span><span>))</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span>
<span>tail</span> <span>(</span><span>NonEmpty</span> <span>[]</span><span>)</span>     <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"impossible: empty NonEmpty value"</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Since the only way to construct or consume <code>NonEmpty</code> values is to use the functions in <code>Data.List.NonEmpty.Newtype</code>’s exported API, the above implementation makes it impossible for clients to violate the non-emptiness invariant. In a sense, values of opaque newtypes are like <em>tokens</em>: the implementing module issues tokens via its constructor functions, and those tokens have no intrinsic value. The only way to do anything useful with them is to “redeem” them to the issuing module’s accessor functions, in this case <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>, to obtain the values contained within.</p>

<p>This approach is significantly weaker than using a constructive datatype, since it is theoretically possible to screw up and accidentally provide a means to construct an invalid <code>NonEmpty []</code> value. For this reason, the newtype approach to type safety does not on its own constitute a <em>proof</em> that a desired invariant holds. However, it restricts the “surface area” where an invariant violation can occur to the defining module, so reasonable confidence the invariant really does hold can be achieved by thoroughly testing the module’s API using fuzzing or property-based testing techniques.<sup><a href="#2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-11-01-names-are-not-type-safety-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some recent <a href="https://twitter.com/gergelyorosz/status/1247132806041546754" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backtracking</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1247130488667394049" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">from</a> what we have been calling “Microservices” has sparked anew the debate around that software architecture pattern. It turns out that for increasingly more software people, having a backend with (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/monzo-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sometimes several</a>) hundreds of services wasn’t that great an idea after all. The debate has <a href="https://riak.com/posts/technical/microservices-please-dont/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">been going on for a while</a> and much has already been said, but there are still a couple of things I’d like to say.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> “Microservices” was a good idea taken too far and applied too bluntly. The fix isn’t just to dial back the granularity knob but instead to 1) focus on the split-join criteria as opposed to size; and 2) differentiate between the project model and the deployment model when applying them.</p>
<p>I explain. Allow me to rant a bit first.</p>


<p>There were three main reasons for the initial success of <em>microservices</em> as an architectural pattern for software: 1) forced modularisation, 2) weakened dependencies, and 3) an excuse for having no architecture. In order:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the monoliths of old, you could in theory enforce module boundaries. You could say that your <code>acme-helpers</code> or <code>acme-data-tools</code> could not depend on <code>acme-domain</code>, say, and you even had some tooling to enforce that, but it was fallible. Especially in big companies where these monoliths spanned more than a team’s cognitive horizon, violations of those boundaries were often a simple <code>import</code> away, and of course rife. Angry architects saw in microservices the promise of making those a thing of the past: now the developer is forced to only deal with the API. Codebases parted ways and calls were made to go down the network stack and back.</li>
<li>
<p>So then, one wouldn’t depend on a fellow service at build time, only at runtime. Great. Method calls became http calls. “Now we don’t need to care about dependencies” — actual people said this, as if the dependency wasn’t fundamental and instead just an accidental artifact of the build setup. Everybody brushed up on their HTTP and different server and client implementations, read all about REST and Soap (and RPC, RMI and CORBA while at it) and merrily created a layer of indirection between modules — now <em>services</em> — that was <em>very</em> loose. Typed APIs, granular network policies and contract testing came much later.</p>
<p>It felt liberating until the complexities of API versioning, delivery semantics, error propagation, distributed transaction management and the sprawl of client code in all callers of a service began to show up. This was a gigantic <strong>shift right</strong>, but hey, the build process was simpler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More insidious perhaps was the validation that “doing microservices” brought to organisations that lacked a thesis about how their architecture should be. There was now a sanctioned answer to most architectural dilemmas: another microservice. Another entry in the service catalog for any and all interested parties to call. This ecology of interacting parties, each acting in their own interest for the common good spoke to an underlying, tacit belief that the emergent mesh of services would approximate the latent natural architecture of the domain.</p>
<p>So soft and convenient was the lure of not having to draw hard architectural lines that we got lazy where we weren’t and accepted our lazyness where we already were. If you didn’t subscribe to that belief, the problem was you and your lack of understanding of complex systems, you objectivist cretin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, there was real pain in managing monoliths and sure, many systems were too monolithic (i.e. had deployables too large) but the zealotry of a newfound purity swung the pendulum too far, as they always do. Not only do we not need to run so many services so small, we also don’t benefit from isolating their codebases so much. To summarise:</p>
<ol>
<li>having a big flat permissive build is no good reason to split deployables;</li>
<li>weakening dependencies between different parts of our systems is a “shift-right” loan with high interest; and</li>
<li>having a ready answer when the thinking gets tough is a soothing lie that just moves complexity about. There is no substitute to the effortful application of cognitive power to a problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two things: focus on the right criteria for splitting a service instead of on its size, and apply those criteria more thoughtfully.</p>
<h2 id="size-is-not-the-answer"><a href="#size-is-not-the-answer" aria-label="size is not the answer permalink"></a>Size is not the answer</h2>
<p>The <em>micro</em> in microservices ought to be at best a prediction, never a goal. We may predict services <em>will be</em> micro but they don’t <em>have to be</em>. <a href="https://kalele.io/microservices-and-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Vaugh Vernon is right</a> when he speaks about “cohesion for a reason”.</p>
<p>There should be no prescribed <em>a priori</em> granularity of services. There <em>is</em> no prescribed size of a service. There are instead <strong>good and bad reasons to split</strong> parts of a software system.</p>
<p>So the heuristic is:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                      Start one, split with a reason.</code></pre></div>
<p>Conversely, if a reason ceases to exist, consider joining them.</p>
<h2 id="the-missing-hinge"><a href="#the-missing-hinge" aria-label="the missing hinge permalink"></a>The missing hinge</h2>
<p>There are however different realms in which “software systems” exist: they exist both as artifacts we interact with and as artifacts computers interact with. Code and binary. We organise them in different ways: the <strong>project model</strong> (repositories, projects, modules and their dependencies) and the <strong>deployment model</strong> (what production environments look like and how deployables run in them).</p>

<p>In the process of going from coarse to granular (i.e. from monolith to microservices) however, little attention was paid to the difference — and possible indirection — between those two models. The hammer hit both fairly indiscriminately and made us split codebases because of runtime concerns and split deployables due to project concerns.</p>

  </figure>
<p>Much like stiffness in a part of the human spine can result in pain in another, <strong>stiffness in our build DAGs is causing excessive mirroring between our project and deployment models</strong>; between our repositories and our services; between the way we organise our code and the way our services run. That mirroring is on the one hand preventing us from shifting left concerns about the relationships between modules that have often been made weak and fragile runtime dependencies, while on the other hand encouraging us to have more services than what the runtime reality would call for. That brings pain.</p>

<p>Central to resolving this stiffness is the realisation that the build flow, at least conceptually, is a DAG – Directed Acyclic Graph – where the nodes are <em>jobs</em> and <em>versioned artifacts</em> and the edges connect either a job to a versioned artifact (“produces”) or a versioned artifact to a jobs (“dependency_of”). Deployables are by definition the versioned artifacts that are consumed by the deployment jobs.</p>

<p>For too long we overlooked how much a flexible and frictionless build DAG allows us to improve our architecture on both sides. With moderately rich build patterns we can have our code where its intent is clearer and more constraints can be validated at build time and still have it deployed into its simplest viable form, running where its execution is cheaper, faster and safer.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the historically accurate account is that would explain the excessive simplicity of build patterns across the industry. I do know from experience that too many practices make do with very simple and linear flows where one repository builds independently one and only one service. Regardless of the legitimate argument about code duplication and its tradeoffs, there seems to be an aversion to build-time internal dependencies, even when these bring in clearly desirable data or logic such as message format definitions.</p>
<p>I suspect it might have something to do with how very few CI tools support composition natively (i.e. the outputs of jobs being able to be the inputs of others), how fallible semantic versioning in practice is and the difficulty of automating deterministic version propagation.</p>
<p>By that I mean keeping local copies in sync with CI, builds repeatable, and new upstream versions automatically used by their downstream dependents. It isn’t trivial and requires some versioning and build-fu that, to my knowledge, most practices end up shortcutting to either sacrifice repeatability by using <code>latest</code> or stifling the flow by requiring repeated manual work. Hence the pressure to have a simple build setup.</p>
<p>The exact cause is unimportant though. What is important is that overcoming this is crucial.</p>

<p>Many criteria for splitting or joining software systems, ranging from the social (teams, bounded contexts) to the mechanical (cpu or io boundedness) have been put forth, and they all make some form of sense. However, most of them are either a good reason to split projects or modules, or a good reason to split deployables, rarely both. Keeping that in mind will help us apply them more effectively.</p>
<p>Below are a few possible criteria and some comments about their application. I’m not trying to be exhaustive, just illustrating the kind of reasoning makes sense to me.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Different Runtime</strong> – If a part of the codebase compiles to a different runtime it becomes a different deployable and we call it a different service.</li>
<li><strong>Elasticity Profile</strong> – Some parts of the system may have a spikier load profile. It might pay off to have them scale in and out separately from the rest.</li>
<li><strong>Load Type</strong> – Some parts of a generally latency-oriented io-bound system may generate occasional peaks of cpu-bound load which can hurt response times. It might be better to put them in a …</li></ul></div></div>
