            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently I've come to know the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> while watching a lecture of the course <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/">Intro to Database Systems</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> on database storage. One of the main problems a database storage engine has to solve is <strong>how to deal with data in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. At a higher level, the main purpose of a disk-oriented storage engine is to manipulate data files in a disk. But if we assume that the data in the disk will eventually get bigger than the available memory, we cannot simply load the whole data file into memory, do the change, and write it back to disk.</p><p>This is not a new problem in Computer Science. When operational systems were being developed in the early 1960s, a similar problem was faced: <strong>how can we run programs stored in disk that are larger than the available memory?</strong> A solution to this problem was made by a group in Manchester, implemented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(computer)">Atlas Computer</a>, in 1961. It was called <em>virtual memory</em>. The <em>virtual memory</em> gives a running program the illusion that it has big enough memory, despite the fact that the computer does not have enough.</p><p>We are not going to go deep on how <em>virtual memory</em> works. Just have in mind that when a program is accessing memory it is accessing the <em>virtual memory</em>. And maybe the data the program is trying to access is not actually in memory, but it does not matter. The operational system will make pretend that it is by going to disk, and putting it there, and replace an old chunk of memory that is not going to be used.</p><p>So, one of the ways a database storage engine can solve the larger than memory problem is to make use of <em>virtual memory</em> and the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong>.</p><p>In Linux, we can make this use by using the system call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> that lets you map a file, no matter how big, directly into memory. If your program needs to manipulate the file, all it needs is to manipulate the memory. The operating system handles the writes to disk for you.</p><p>In some occasions, programmers find this method more convenient than the usual system calls: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close</a>.</p><h3 id="a-simple-demonstration">A simple demonstration</h3><p>Here is a small example of how you can take advantage of this in Go using the package <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>:</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"os"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go"
)

func main() {
	f, _ := os.OpenFile("./file", os.O_RDWR, 0644)
	defer f.Close()
	
	mmap, _ := mmap.Map(f, mmap.RDWR, 0 )
	defer mmap.Unmap()
	fmt.Println(string(mmap))
	
	mmap[0] = 'X'
	mmap.Flush()
}</code></pre><figure><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/pRS8PvTRHksnCVQgSOWvPBF3a.svg" alt="asciicast"></figure><p>The beauty is that we could have a much bigger file, and the solution would still work. We would not have to worry about managing memory in order to avoid it filling up.</p><h3 id="detailing-mmap-capabilites">Detailing <em>mmap</em> capabilites</h3><p>We're going to explore more <em>mmap</em> functionalities from the point of view of the API provided by <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>. There are probably more features that the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix#Mmap">native syscall</a> provides that this library does not implement.</p><h4 id="the-prot-argument">The <code>prot</code> argument</h4><p>Here is the <code>mmap.Map</code> signature</p><pre><code>func Map(f *os.File, prot, flags int) (MMap, error) 
</code></pre><p>Let's look at <code>prot</code> first. The <code>prot</code> argument lets you specify the protection levels of your mapping: <code>RDONLY</code>, <code>RDWR</code>, <code>EXEC</code> are the options provided for <code>mmap-go</code>. These levels are pretty straightforward, <code>RDONLY</code> means you can only read from the mapping, <code>RDWR</code> means you can also write, and <code>EXEC</code> means you can execute code on that mapping. &nbsp;Here is the description of <code>prot</code> from the Linux <code>man</code>:</p><pre><code>The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the
mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).
It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or more of the
following flags:

PROT_EXEC
    Pages may be executed.

PROT_READ
    Pages may be read.

PROT_WRITE
    Pages may be written.

PROT_NONE
    Pages may not be accessed.
</code></pre><p>In the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix">unix package</a>, those flags are: <code>unix.PROT_EXEC</code>, <code>unix.PROT_READ</code>, <code>unix.PROT_WRITE</code> and <code>unix.PROT_NONE</code>.</p><h4 id="experimenting-with-prot_exec-flag">Experimenting with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> flag</h4><p>I've become intrigued by the <code>EXEC</code> flag and wanted to see an example of how that works. I've Google and could not find any example. So I tried a search in Github by <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and found a good example in <code>C</code>: <a href="https://github.com/onesmash/MMapExecDemo">MMapExecDemo</a>. I replicated this example in <code>Go</code> using <code>mmap-go</code>.</p><p>The first step was to create a function that I wanted to be put in memory by <code>mmap</code> allocation, compile it, and get its assembly opcodes.</p><p>I created the <code>inc</code> function in <code>inc.go</code> file</p><pre><code>package inc

func inc(n int) int {
	return n + 1
}

</code></pre><p>compiled it with <code>go tool compile -S -N inc.go</code>, then got its assembly by calling <code>go tool objdump -S inc.o</code>.</p><pre><code>func inc(n int) int {
  0x22b                 48c744241000000000      MOVQ $0x0, 0x10(SP)
        return n + 1
  0x234                 488b442408              MOVQ 0x8(SP), AX
  0x239                 48ffc0                  INCQ AX
  0x23c                 4889442410              MOVQ AX, 0x10(SP)
  0x241                 c3                      RET
</code></pre><p>With this, we can build represent our function in bytes on our code</p><pre><code>code := []byte{
        0x48, 0xc7, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
		0x48, 0x8b, 0x44, 0x24, 0x08,
		0x48, 0xff, 0xc0,
		0x48, 0x89, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10,
		0xc3,
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate our memory with <code>mmap</code>.</p><pre><code>memory, err := mmap.MapRegion(nil, len(code), mmap.EXEC|mmap.RDWR, mmap.ANON, 0)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
</code></pre><p>In this call, we're using a more complete function called <code>MapRegion</code> that lets you specify how much memory you are allocating (<code>Map</code> allocates the size of the underlying file) and the offset of the file.</p><p>In the beginning, we said that the main purpose of <code>mmap</code> was to create a mapping between a file and memory. But in this call we are not indicating any file. <code>mmap</code> can be used just a regular memory allocater by setting <code>nil</code> to the <code>*os.File</code> argument and <code>mmap.ANON</code> to the <code>flags</code> argument. We will talk about more <code>mmap.ANON</code>. Since we are not mapping any file, the offset is <code>0</code>.</p><p>So we have memory allocated with the same size of our code <code>len(code)</code>. Since we set the flag <code>mmap.RDWR</code>, we can copy our <code>code</code> to <code>memory</code>.</p><pre><code>copy(memory, code)
</code></pre><p>We have the code of our <code>inc</code> function in memory. In order to execute it, we have to cast that memory address to a function with a signature that matches the signature of our compiled <code>inc</code>.</p><pre><code>memory_ptr := &amp;memory
ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&amp;memory_ptr)
inc := *(*func(int) int)(ptr)
</code></pre><p>When we call <code>inc</code>, we are executing the code we put in memory. That only works because of the flag <code>mmap.EXEC</code>. If that flag was not set, a <code>segmentation violation</code> would occur.</p><pre><code>fmt.Println(inc(10)) // Prints 11
</code></pre><p>I don't know if this is a real use case. I just wanted to see what it meant to execute code that you put in memory. And there are probably other ways of achieving the same with regular memory allocation and calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a>.</p><p>One question that may come up is: but the code is already in the <code>code</code> variable, can't we just execute it? No, because the memory static allocated to <code>code</code> is not executable. Can we make it executable? I've tried to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a> on it but still got <code>segmentation violation</code>.</p><p>Here is the full working <a href="https://gist.github.com/brunoac/b9ff4ad46c27926e5e4f078133d0de79">gist</a>.</p><h4 id="the-flags-argument">The <code>flags</code> argument</h4><p>We can have many processes mapping the same memory region. This argument lets us decide about the visibility of the updates happening in the mapping. There are many flags, and you can check them out at <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>. The important ones are <code>unix.MAP_SHARED</code>, <code>unix.MAP_PRIVATE</code> and <code>unix.MAP_ANON</code>.</p><p><code>MAP_SHARED</code> means that changes to the mapping are visible to all processes and will also occur at the underlying mapped file, although we cannot control when.</p><p><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> means the changes are private and other processes will not see them. And also, they are not carried through to the underlying file.</p><p><code>MAP_ANON</code> means that there is not going to be a mapped file. It is useful for sub-processes communication with shared memory.</p><p>I've got confused about the <code>mmap-go</code> library implementation. It only provides the <code>mmap.ANON</code> flag, that we used in the above example. If you want your mapping to be private, you can set the <code>mmap.COPY</code> flag to the <code>prot</code> argument. Anyways, you can always use the flags provided by the <code>unix</code> package implementation.</p><h4 id="locking-and-flushing">Locking and flushing</h4><p>Two other nice methods, <code>Lock</code> and <code>Flush</code>, are provided by the API of <code>mmap-go</code>. The <code>Lock</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a> system call that prevents the mapping to be paged out to disk. And the <code>Flush</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msync.2.html">msync</a> system call that forces the data in memory to be written to disk. This is a good way to trying to have more control over how and when data is flushed to disk.</p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3><p>I felt kind of stupid of knowing about <code>mmap</code> after so long. I don't remember it being brought in my college class. For some reason, I felt amazed by it and its capabilities and decided to dig deeper. I like databases and I'm aiming to get a better grasp of them. This means that <code>mmap</code> cannot go unnoticed from my learning. For future posts, I'll try to bring about the benefits and drawbacks of using <code>mmap</code>, which projects use it, and what kind of problems it is suited for.</p><p>Even though the <code>mmap</code> can be used to solve that database problem we stated in the beginning, and many modern databases use it, <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> advocates against it and have three lecture on how to databases, that don't use <code>mmap</code>, manage data.</p><p>If you like this kind of content, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/brunocalza">twitter</a>.

									<p>With COVID-19 forcing many of us indoors and cooking more (yes, this post took a little longer to go live than I planned), there’s never been a better time to really learn how to cook. I grew up not learning much about how to cook and taught myself as an adult. Over the last 5-7 years I went from someone who could do the absolute bare minimum (boil pasta, cook chicken breast, etc) to genuinely quite a decent cook. I can easily whip up dinner for 4-6 friends without stressing, cook healthy dinners at home most nights of the week, run a barbecue for 12 people, and have a small quiver of fancy dishes to impress friends, family, and my wife from time to time. This post is mostly about what works for me, but I’m calling it Cooking For Founders because I think it will resonate with a lot of entrepreneurs who think like me.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is not to teach you how to cook but to provide fairly comprehensive, but also minimum viable, roadmap for going from a cooking noob to solid home chef.</p>
<h2>Why you should cook</h2>
<p>Until I was about 25 or so I really didn’t cook much. I lived in places like NYC and London where restaurants were always open and ubiquitous and especially in these cities, it’s a perfectly reasonable position to just not bother learning to cook well. But I want to make the case that even if you have world class restaurants and food delivery services on demand, you should learn to cook.</p>
<p><strong>Social: </strong>Home cooked meals are an awesome offer that people are very likely to take you up on and really appreciate. Cooking well is sexy and makes for an awesome date night. Dinner parties are fantastic well to meet new people and create a vibrant personal and professional network. Taking charge of a meal is a great way to bring your family together or impress your in-laws.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Health: </strong>Even if you aren’t bothering with any particular diet (low carb, paleo, etc), cooking at home is almost always going to be more nutritious than food from restaurants. Getting actually healthy food from restaurants/delivery is almost always expensive. Cooking at home is an affordable way to get great nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Mental Health:&nbsp;</strong>This may be more specific to me, but I find cooking to be fantastic for my mental health. In my house I’m the one cooking about 90% of the time and I’m not into the mega meal prep strategies where you cook food for the whole week. So, most days, I’m cooking something fresh for dinner. The need to start cooking prep in time for a reasonable dinner puts a natural stopping point in my work day and then I get to switch to a very focused mono-tasking activity. This routine is, for me, a kind of meditation that separates the work day and let’s my brain process the events of the day.</p>
<h2>Meta-learning Tips for Learning to Cook</h2>
<p>Learning to cook is not exactly easy. There is an infinite amount of recipes, techniques, resources, diets, and on and on to consume. It can be overwhelming. Learning to cook is almost always laden with failures along the way. You’ll screw up some recipes, ruin some dishes, and get halfway through a complex recipe before realizing you’re missing some essential ingredient. Here are some lessons I’ve learned on how to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Find your YouTube &amp; TikTok muses</strong></p>
<p>There is an infinite amount of cooking content on the internet, but when you find a particular chef or channel that really speaks your language, subscribe and binge their entire backlog. Lots of channels out there will skip essential explanations, use overly exotic ingredients, or complex unnecessary techniques so when you find one that consistently speaks to you, lock it in. Some ones I like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/helenrennie">Helen Rennie (YouTube)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/foodwishes">Food Wishes (YouTube)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SeriousEats">Serious Eats (YouTube)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatdudecancook?lang=en">@thatdudecancook (TikTok)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sad_papi?lang=en">@sad_papi (TikTok)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Have a backup plan</strong></p>
<p>Learning to cook and feeding yourself can be two different things, especially when you are first starting out and failure rates are high. If you are going to try a new recipe for the first time on a busy week night that’s supposed to be your dinner that night (1) go for it! (2) have a frozen pizza or some other quick and easy back up plan ready in case you end up ruining the dish. It’s a really negative feedback loop to mess up a recipe and having to end up eating cereal for dinner, so have a backup plan.</p>
<p><strong>Read/watch the recipe several times well before cooking</strong></p>
<p>Read or watch your recipes <em>carefully,&nbsp;</em>several times, in preparation for trying a new recipe. It’s easy to miss, especially at first, that the recipe actually requires marinating over night, or needs buttermilk or some other ingredient you don’t typically have on hand. Don’t just plop open the recipe book at 7p and start with Step #1.</p>
<p><strong>Stick to a few core cookbooks</strong></p>
<p>Again, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the millions of cookbooks out there. Like YouTube channels, I recommend finding a few comprehensive cookbooks that work for you and sticking to them for years until you get very confident with a wide variety of techniques. With cookbooks, Kindle will work but having the physical copy can also be really helpful (or honestly I usually get both). Here are some that I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3seCIbQ">How To Cook Everything, Mark Bittman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3oyrCwn">Cooking For Geeks, Jeff Potter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3sfvapE">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, Samin Nosrat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/38wzSre">The Four Hour Chef, Tim Ferriss</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Essential Concepts</h2>
<p>The books and channels above all have great introductions to all of these concepts so I’m not going to try to actually cover them here, but I think it’s useful have a few simple concepts to check off as you read/watch through the first few.</p>
<p><strong>What heat does (chemistry)</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you pay attention to the sections on the basic chemistry of heat. The vast majority of cooking is just different ways applying heat to food and it’s critical to understand what heat is doing to different kinds of foods. For the most part heat is either (1) denaturing proteins or (2) producing a Maillard Reaction. Denaturing proteins is the slow gradual cooking process that turns eggs from runny to scrambled or steak from rare to well done. Different foods have different kinds of proteins which denature at different temperatures and in different ways. The Maillard Reaction is browning (mostly on on meats and vegetables) and happens at very high heat and low moisture environments. Read up on these carefully. Cooking for Geeks covers these the best in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Different kinds of heat transfer (physics)</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to understanding what heat does, it’s really important to have a basic grasp of the various methods of applying heat to food. Baking, broiling, roasting, sautéing, braising, searing, sous vide, boiling, and so on, are all just different methods for applying heat. Some, like baking, use convection where the air is heated up around the food, and others, like searing in a pan, use conduction where the heat is transferred directly surface to surface. A cast iron pan takes a very long time to heat up and stays hot for a long time, whereas the air in your oven can dissipate its heat quickly. Understanding these basic concepts will give you the architecture for understanding for why you should keep the oven door closed as much as possible, dry your meat before searing, and pre-heat your heavy pans for longer than your light ones.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong></p>
<p>When you are first learning to cook I recommend avoiding complex recipes in favor of simple two or three-part meals where each component is cooked individually. The vast majority of our home-cooked meals involve cooking (a) a protein like fish or meat (b) a vegetable cooked simply, like roasted in olive oil and (c) a starch like rice, potatoes, simple pasta. This let’s you build a healthy meal with simple individual components, master the same techniques with repeat practice, and minimize the risk of blowing up the whole dish.</p>
<p><strong>Make it taste good</strong></p>
<p>This may seem obvious, but it’s important that the food you cook actually taste good. Home-cooked food is almost always healthier than restaurant food, so don’t try to learn to cook and cook the healthiest possible version of each dish. Most veggies taste better roasted in a generous amount of olive oil than they do steamed, so roast them! Baste your chicken in butter. Salt your food generously. Learning to cook by producing dishes that just aren’t that tasty is a very bad feedback loop, so do what you need to to make it taste good.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t cook everything evenly</strong></p>
<p>This is a little more specific but I feel like it needs to be specifically counter-programmed. For some dumb reason a lot people (including myself 10 years ago) got the notion that food needs to be cooked&nbsp;<em>evenly</em>. That it’s really important to constantly turn and shake and rotate your food so that it’s cooked the same all the around and through. This is a great way to make gross food. Stop touching and turning your food. Most dishes are better with a substantial amount of difference in how cooked different sides of the food are: steak with a crunchy sear and medium rare inside, roasted potatoes with a waxy crust and fluffy inside, carrots or asparagus charred on side are all much tastier and mostly produced by having uneven cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Baking is really hard</strong></p>
<p>Really. Baking is much harder and less forgiving than any other kind of cooking. If you’re just starting to get into cooking, don’t start with baking.</p>
<h2>Essential Gear</h2>
<p>Okay, obviously you can spend and absolute fortune and fill a kitchen with mountains of cooking gear. That’s part of the fun of getting into cooking, let’s be honest. But if all you’ve got is a crappy 10-piece Wal-mart cooking set you got as a wedding gift or a hodge podge you inherited from your roommates, and you need to build your kitchen from scratch, this is the minimum kit I think you need. <em>(Disclosure: most of these are Amazon affiliates links. Don’t click them if that’s a thing that will make you mad).</em></p>
<p><strong>Pots and Pans</strong></p>
<p>The essential workhorses of cooking. Different kinds of pots and pans provide really different value for money, so I’ll specifically recommend below which ones I think it makes sense to invest in something …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
  
  <p><span>Jan 2021</span></p>
  <p>I started a new job recently so I had the opportunity to get one of the new M1 MacBooks, I decided to go with the Air. The reviews have been very positive and I’m here to tell you: it is indeed an amazing device. The performance feels a lot better than my MacBook Pro 16”, which is only a year old and about 3x the price.</p>

<p>When I got the Mac I set out with the goal of avoiding Intel builds of software as much as possible and using native whenever possible unless it’s absolutely impossible.</p>

<h2 id="nix">Nix</h2>

<p>I have my <a href="https://github.com/bouk/b" target="_blank">whole system configuration</a> stored in <a href="https://bou.ke/blog/nix/">Nix</a>, which was the thing that I least expected to work and arm64 support is still a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/95903" target="_blank">work in progress</a>. I could install the <code>x86_64</code> build of Nix and run it under Rosetta but wanted to avoid that, so I went back to my old pal;</p>

<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>

<p>This was one of the first things I installed and got working, when I did it I had to install it into <code>/opt/homebrew</code> manually and install everything with the <code>--source</code> flag but… everything mostly worked? Lots of props to the Homebrew team for getting everything running so quickly, with some amazing <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857" target="_blank">open-source project management</a> the community worked together very quickly to support most of the software that Homebrew offers. There’s still some software that doesn’t work—notably neovim. But I’m sure that will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>The installer now installs into <code>/opt/homebrew</code> by default and there’s prebuilt bottles of most packages, so the Homebrew experience is great.</p>

<h2 id="go">Go</h2>

<p>A lot of my work involves Go, and I depend on a lot of tools written in Go. I was happy to see that the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/ports" target="_blank">Go team was on top of it</a> and released the 1.16 beta quite quickly, which is what is installed right now when you do <code>brew install go</code>. I’ve had no issues with it and am enjoying some of the new features like <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41191" target="_blank">file embedding</a>. GoLand was also <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2020/12/30/goland-2020-3-1-is-out/" target="_blank">updated</a> to support M1 pretty quickly.</p>

<h2 id="terraform">Terraform</h2>

<p>Terraform I had the most issues with since using it depends on a bunch of plugins, which are generally only available for x86_64. This won’t change until Go 1.16 has been released. So here I had to resort to building for x86_64, which is easy to do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl -L 'https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/archive/v0.14.4.tar.gz' | tar -xzf-
cd terraform-0.14.4/
GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ~/bin/terraform
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now Terraform will just use plugin built for Intel. I assume that most Terraform plugins will support arm64 very quickly after Go 1.16 is out.</p>

<h2 id="rust-and-universal-binaries">Rust and Universal Binaries</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty" target="_blank">Alacritty</a> as my terminal. It supported <code>arm64</code> pretty quickly but the current build for it doesn’t include it, so I <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/4683" target="_blank">made a PR</a> that will build a universal binary. Creating a universal binary for Rust is quite easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo build <span>--release</span> <span>--target</span><span>=</span>x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build <span>--release</span> <span>--target</span><span>=</span>aarch64-apple-darwin
lipo target/<span>{</span>x86_64,aarch64<span>}</span><span>-apple-darwin</span>/release/alacritty <span>-create</span> <span>-output</span> alacritty
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running <code>file alacritty</code> will now show you something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>alacritty: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64]
alacritty (for architecture x86_64):    Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
alacritty (for architecture arm64):     Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you can run it in either <code>x86_64</code> mode with <code>arch -x86_64 alacritty</code> or natively with <code>arch -arm64 alacritty</code> and the OS will automatically select the right binary.</p>

<p>Building a universal binary for a Go application is similarly easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app_amd64 main.go
GOARCH=arm64 go build -o app_arm64 main.go
lipo app_{amd64,arm64} -create -output app
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="windows-and-games">Windows and Games</h2>

<p>There’s a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Mythology" target="_blank">games</a> I’ve been playing for a long time that I still need on any computer I get, but they’re 32-bit Windows-only. This was something that was surprisingly easy to get working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/" target="_blank">Parallels Technical Preview</a></li>
  <li>Sign up for Windows Insider and download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64" target="_blank">Windows 10 on ARM Insider Preview</a></li>
  <li>Install it into Parallels</li>
  <li>Done</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can download Steam and basically install anything and it will probably work. Microsoft really did some amazing magic in getting both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 programs running on <code>arm64</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bou.ke/images/windows-solitaire.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Somehow Apple has created the best PC in every category at once. It is even the best Windows PC, despite the multiple layers of emulation that are happening. The battery life is incredible, I haven’t experienced any slowdowns, I don’t hear any fans spin up (because there are none). It’s hard not to be excited about this.</p>

<p>If Apple chose to go down this path, they could dominate the server space if they took their magic chips, put it in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit" target="_blank">rack unit</a> and made it easy to install Linux onto it. Intel is completely screwed unless they come up with something better, fast.</p>

					<p>Trump administration lies constantly but doesn’t even attempt to make it seem like they aren’t lying.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, this kind of cynicism was referred to as the “reverse cargo cult” effect.</p>
<p>In a regular cargo cult, you have people who see an airstrip, and the cargo drops, so they build one out of straw, hoping for the same outcome. They don’t know the difference between a straw airstrip and a real one, they just want the cargo.</p>
<p>In a reverse cargo cult, you have people who see an airstrip, and the cargo drops, so they build one out of straw. But there’s a twist:</p>
<p>When they build the straw airstrip, it <em>isn’t</em> because they are hoping for the same outcome. They know the difference, and know that because their airstrip is made of straw, it certainly won’t yield any cargo, but it serves another purpose. They don’t lie to the rubes and tell them that an airstrip made of straw will bring them cargo. That’s an easy lie to dismantle. Instead, what they do is make it clear that the airstrip is made of straw, and doesn’t work, but then tell you that the other guy’s airstrip doesn’t work either. They tell you that <strong>no airstrips yield cargo</strong>. The whole <em>idea of cargo</em> is a lie, and those fools, with their fancy airstrip made out of wood, concrete, and metal is just as wasteful and silly as one made of straw.</p>
<p>1980s Soviets knew that their government was lying to them about the strength and power of their society, the Communist Party couldn’t hide all of the dysfunctions people saw on a daily basis. This didn’t stop the Soviet leadership from lying. Instead, they just accused the West of being equally deceptive. <em>“Sure, things might be bad here, but they are just as bad in America, and in America people are actually foolish enough to believe in the lie! Not like you, clever people. You get it. You know it is a lie.”</em></p>
<p>Trump’s supporters don’t care about being lied to. You can point out the lies until you’re blue in the face, but it makes no difference to them. Why? Because it is just a game to them. The media lies, bloggers lie, politicians lie, it’s just all a bunch of lies. Facts don’t matter because those are lies also. Those trolls on Twitter, 4Chan, T_D, etc. are just having a good laugh. They are congratulating each other for being so smart. We are fools for still believing in anything. There is no cargo, and probably never was.</p>

    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.</p>

<p>These are rare skills, responsible for making them who they are. Most normal people, including me, don’t realise it. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</p>

<p>However, I aim to change that. What follows below are 10 skills sourced from admirable people that I want to develop.</p>

<p>So, learn the most basic, most useful skills first. The longer you wait to learn skills like these, the less time there is for compounding magic. That’s what this entire list is about: powerful skills to learn and use for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>And even though you’ve heard about compounding, this item is first on the list, because <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/taking-ideas-seriously.html">taking ideas seriously is hard</a>.</p>

<p>A good way to figure out what compounds is <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">to figure out what’s a platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-develop-taste">Learn to develop taste</h2>

<p>Despite prevalent beliefs, taste isn’t subjective.</p>

<p>While it may seem like it on the outside, when you say “I just love this painting” or “I just love this coffee machine” - all it means is that the defining characteristics are illegible to you. And noticing this is the first step.</p>

<p>Let’s take a specific example. Say you’re designing a high quality clay pot - and you’ve never done this before.</p>

<p>What’s a good way to develop taste for quality here?</p>

<p>If you’ve heard this claypot parable, you know the answer: start by making lots of crap pots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A,” forty pounds a “B,” and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an “A.”</p><p>

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. - <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9o17A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art and Fear</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Let others tell you what you’ve made is crap. Learn why. Notice when they tell you something is great. Figure out why.</p>

<p>This transfers to writing as well: Popular advice to get better is to write a lot of junk, do it a 100 times, and pay particular attention to what is received well. Here’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another example - developing taste for design</a>.</p>

<p>In effect, you bootstrap good taste by first learning what others consider good. Then, <a href="#learn-to-see-systems">you see the system behind it</a>. Then you break the rules and still manage to awe.</p>

<p>Then you’ve developed taste.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-sequence-things-well">Learn to sequence things well</h2>

<p>Waking up when others are asleep and getting lots done is a super power. It’s born out of a system of <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/sequencing-things-in-the-right-order.html">learning to sequence things well</a>.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right time for that Netflix binge.</p>

<p>It means being prepared before the meeting, not scrambling to get things done after.</p>

<p>It means reading the coursebook before the lecture, not after.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-what-others-see">Learn to see what others see</h2>

<p>How well can you understand other people? Can you sense their desires, their concerns, and what events lead to those desires and concerns?</p>

<p>If you can do this, you can understand them. But not before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. - <a href="https://amzn.to/2KKe8Px" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender’s Game</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth going this far because understanding is powerful. It helps you empathise. It helps you negotiate. It helps you figure out why you don’t have product-market fit. It helps you learn quickly: you can switch through personas and see what will and won’t work.</p>

<p>How do you do learn to see? I know no better way than to practice. Try it a 100 times. <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe">Come back next year</a>, and maybe I’ll have a better way once I’ve done it a 100 times.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-make-and-execute-decisions-quickly">Learn to make and execute decisions quickly</h2>

<p>Most people have a bias towards analysis-paralysis versus getting shit done.</p>

<p>When decisions are reversible - and they mostly are - speed is a super power. Cultivating a habit of making decisions quickly, and then executing them is better than just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Training this skill begins as easily as deciding what to eat on a huge menu. It’s a small step, but over time, <a href="#learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">even the smallest steps compound</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-spot-a-convex-or-concave-world">Learn to spot a convex or concave world</h2>

<p>In the world of viral infections, a 50% lockdown is worse than a 0% and a 100% lockdown, both. The virus isn’t contained, and businesses have to shut down, too.</p>

<p>In the world of immigration policies, letting some specific people in is better than letting no one or everyone in. The middle ground is better than the extremes.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is great, you’re in a concave disposition.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is worse than either, you’re in a convex disposition.</p>

<p>The world is sometimes concave, and sometimes convex. Knowing your topology can help you make better decisions.</p>

<p>I first noted this when <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin explained it</a>. Read it for more concrete examples.</p>

<p>People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a>, but it’s the power of stories over facts. The right framing gets you further than all the facts combined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas &amp; facts contextualised by stories are more powerful than either alone.</p>

There’s lots to unpack here, and this is the first skill I’ve been working on for the past few months. Watch out for a long blogpost in 2 weeks!</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-dive-into-the-source-code-when-documentation-isnt-enough">Learn to dive into the source code when documentation isn’t enough</h2>

<p>Sometimes, there’s no precedent for what you want to do. Or the people who did it before didn’t write a manual.</p>

<p>In cases like these, figuring things out for yourself is powerful. Research papers and obscure books aren’t just for scientists. They’re freely available on the internet* for all of humanity to use. Learn to use it. Learn about resources like <a href="https://sci-hub.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciHub</a>, <a href="https://libgen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGen</a>, and hiring researchers. You’re allowed to hire people (specially graduate students!) to satisfy your research concerns.</p>

<p>… and when you’re done, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#writing-code">preserve context for future you</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like trying to use an API that has no documentation. Would’ve been easy if there was documentation, but there isn’t. So you got to do it the hard way: read the source code and figure out what you need to make things work.</p>

<p>It’s also like <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html">figuring out what you need to build rockets yourself</a> when existing ones are too expensive.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-be-specific">Learn to be specific</h2>

<p>Every time I gave an example above, I was training my specificity muscles.</p>

<p>Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about. Not being specific is a sign of that. The more abstract the word, the harder it is to pin down a meaning.</p>

<p>For example, “negative ramifications” doesn’t tell you what exactly happened, while “the sonic boom from the new supersonic jet destroyed windows in a 100m radius” is a lot more specific.</p>

<p>Learn to be specific, and learn to spot when others aren’t. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-systems">Learn to see systems</h2>

<p>There’s two kinds of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob, who will see this list, find some skills very interesting, and then go about honing those skills</li>
  <li>Alice, who will see this list, and wonder how I came up with these
<!-- - The Inspiration-Junkie, who will lurk and move on to the next inspiring post without changing anything -->
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice would then try to understand the system that generated these ideas. Then, she’ll adopt the system, and come up with skills possibly more relevant to herself.</p>

<p>Having the option to do both is powerful. Since Bob is the default, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">learn to be like Alice</a>. Choose <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">systems when things are important</a> to you. Choose hacks when you need a quickfix.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>In <a href="http://blog.joshhaas.com/2016/10/mr-robot-is-not-weird-enough/">my last post</a>, I took issue with the TV show <i>Mr. Robot</i> for not being weird enough. Although imaginative and compelling, its universe is well-ordered: everything happens for a reason.</p>
<div>

<p>If you’re looking for media to consume that doesn’t suffer from that problem, I recommend <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/"><i>Kentucky Route Zero</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>I <a href="http://blog.joshhaas.com/2016/10/yet-another-review-of-the-trump-clinton-debate/">previously discussed</a> <i>Kentucky Route Zero</i> (<i>KR0</i> for short) in the context of the first Trump-Clinton debate. It’s relevant to that because it’s a tour through coal-country America, and it engages with the desolation there that’s fueling Trump’s support.</p>

<p>As a portrait of the region, it’s a Picasso or maybe a Goya, not a Velázquez. It has moments where it approaches documentary realism, but it mostly traverses an imaginary landscape reflecting its creators’ perceptions, inspired by their real-life travels in Kentucky.</p>

<p><i>KR0</i>’s medium is a computer game, but “game” is misleading. There’s no element of skill. It has the interface of an adventure game, but unlike other games in that genre, your progression through the story isn’t blocked by puzzles to solve. Rather, it’s more like a work of interactive fiction. The story is mainly told through dialogue, though the soundtrack and visuals are important pieces of the experience.</p>
<div>

<p>The medium is appropriate: it makes a better game than it would a book or a tv show. The ambition seems to be to create a world, and the ability to explore it freely is important. There’s a narrative, but the world is alive beyond the narrative, and there’s a lot to discover outside the main plot.</p>

</div>
<p>The three-person studio that produced <i>KR0</i>, Cardboard Computer, has been trying to erase the lines between their fictional universe and the real one. They’ve released a number of companion pieces to the game, including <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/the-entertainment/">an experience for Occulus Rift or Mac / PC</a> where you participate as a cast member of a fictional 1973 production of a one-act play. The play appears to depict events that occur in a bar a few hours before the character you play in <i>KR0</i> visits the bar in the game, but the fictional set designer for the 1973 production — ie, a real person in the production’s fictional reality — is also a character in <i>KR0</i>. In case that wasn’t confusing enough, you can buy a <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/lem-doolittle/the-entertainment/paperback/product-21312732.html">print copy of the script</a>, published under the name of the fictional author.</p>

<p>It’s not a bad play, either. As the script advertises, “The one-act play “A Reckoning,” set in a tavern in central Kentucky, is Doolittle’s take on the sort of barroom tragedy made popular by O’Neill, Gorky, etc.”, and I would say it stands on its own as a piece of theater, although the ending will have more resonance if you’ve played through <i>KR0</i>.</p>

<p>This almost pedantic accumulation of fictional detail, both inside and outside the game — names, biographies, places, events — lends believability and power to <i>KR0</i>’s magical realist plot-line. Because the production team took such great pains to create verisimilitude, the more fantastic elements of the game feel justified: hauntings, strange and implausible creatures, a whiskey company whose employees are all glowing skeletons, and the titular Route 0, a hidden underground highway through non-euclidean space.</p>

<p>The game’s plot is simple and unobtrusive compared to the sprawling, strange world it is set in. Conway, a truck driver for an antiques store, is trying to make a delivery to Dogwood Drive, a street that doesn’t show up on his maps. As he looks for it, he picks up some traveling companions, and we learn more about his and their pasts. <i>KR0</i> isn’t complete yet —the game is divided into five acts, and final one hasn’t been released — so I don’t know yet if Conway ever makes it to his destination.  In fact, I still don’t know what he’s delivering, or to whom.</p>

<p>As a player, the main way you exert agency is through your choice of dialogue options. Unusually for adventure-style games, your dialogue choices don’t seem to affect the plot. Rather, they affect the past: you can give the characters different backstories, influence their temperaments, change how they see the world and treat each other. It’s a limited degree of freedom: I haven’t flexed the game aggressively to see how divergent you can make it, but my understanding is that the basic outline of who the characters are always remains the same. It’s more of a matter of altering the shadings.</p>

<p>The net effect of the simple plot, the strange, expansive world, and the freedom to emphasize and explore different aspects of the characters is that playing the game doesn’t feel like you’re being told a story, with themes and a moral. Rather, it feels more like an invitation to you, the player, to interpret what you’re confronted with. The game gives you a lot of details to work with, and powerful images and emotions, but leaves you to decide what to think about it all.</p>

<p>At its heart, I think <i>Kentucky Route Zero</i> is a meditation on entropy. Certainly, entropy is the unifying characteristic of the game world. <i>KR0</i>’s setting is a Kentucky that’s been devastated by the collapse of the coal industry and by the 2008 housing crisis. Everything you encounter is in some state of falling apart. The gas station you refuel at has overdue electric bills. The bar can’t buy alcohol any more. The coal mine is abandoned. Conway’s dog looks like she’s seen better days. All the characters have various stories of poverty, alcoholism, loss, and debt.</p>

<p>Entropy has different facets. There are many different stances that one can take towards it. <i>KR0</i> seems to explore each of them in turn, weighing them, inviting you to partake.</p>

<p>The most basic stances are the emotional ones: despair, grief, and anger. There’s certainly plenty of that throughout the game. In one particularly powerful moment, you come across a memorial for coal miners who drowned when some tunnels were flooded in an accident a decade or so ago.  The memorial is a collection of hard-hats floating in an underground lake, accompanied by an angry, hand-written sign accusing the mining company of negligence. In another moment, you meet a team of engineers who spent their lives trying to build a computer system (called Xanadu, presumably a reference to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">real world could-have-been internet competitor</a>), who are now just sitting around hopelessly, having given up on ever completing their lives’ work.</p>

<p>Another stance is simple momentum: keeping going on as long as you can. One character you meet is a switchboard technician, the last one on her team after all her coworkers were laid off by the phone company automating the systems. They couldn’t quite automate her, so she keeps plugging away, alone in a tunnel, connecting call after call. There’s also a church, relocated to a warehouse by some beauracrats, where the congregation all drifted away, the preacher left, and now it’s just a janitor who puts on pre-recorded sermons every Sunday.</p>

<p>Entropy and grief can also give rise to beauty. <i>KR0</i> has plenty of beautiful moments too. The game has a gorgeous soundtrack, mixing electronic music and ambience with bluegrass classics. The bluegrass pieces, performed by a mysterious wandering trio who occasionally wander across your path, are all explorations of loss and hardship, transmuted into folk songs and hymns. The visual palette of the game is mixture of blues and oranges, mostly subdued and minimalist, but occasionally spectacular. Everything has a satisfying organic, analog feel. Radio systems crackle, televisions hum, computers react to strange magnetic fluctuations.</p>

<p>Yet another approach to entropy is to consume and exploit it. At various points in the game, you encounter modern, structured institutions, that are in the process of channeling the breakdown toward their own ends. There’s a whiskey distillery that’s steadily acquiring the balance sheets and souls of the folks you meet. You get to take a tour of its expansive, industrially-clean factory in an amazing descent-into-hell sequence that feels like Dante meets OSHA. The local power company also seems to be on the march. There are also more highbrow institutions consuming the entropy. For instance, you visit the “Bureau of Reclaimed Space”, which seems to represent government, taking in weirdness and outputting paperwork. In another interlude, you find an entire town that’s been transplanted to be inside a museum, the residents still living in their houses, enclosed in a giant glass warehouse.</p>

<p>Somewhat related to high-brow consumption, there’s intellectualization of entropy. <i>KR0</i> has a steady stream of references to academia. You meet a number of characters who have spent time in the grad student / post-doc limbo space, and there’s a lot of art and math jargon. From an academic perspective, entropy is a source of phenomena to record, analyze, and write papers about — hopefully publishable ones. This content is a reflection of the game itself, which in many ways feels like a modern art project. <i>KR0</i> is obsessed with topology and imaginary spaces. Characters muse about space aloud, and as you move around the game, you explore a number of different spaces and means of navigating them: a driving map of Kentucky as navigated by truck, the same map as navigated by a bird, a bureaucratic office building where you ride an elevator up and down, a pure mathematical abstraction that you traverse by turning around at certain symbols, an endless underground river where you are swept along on a boat, among others. This self-conscious exploration invites you to see the entropy in <i>KR0’s</i> world as something to think about and study.</p>

<p>Finally, entropy gives rise to newness: the inadvertent creativity of random processes. Two of the more memorable characters you meet are a pair of androids that, in their telling, emerged from the mines as shapeless lumps, and transformed themselves into a pair of motorcycle-riding musicians, who are now <a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/kentucky-route-zeros-junebug-set-release-tktk-album-androids/">releasing an album outside the game</a>. Abandoned things in <i>KR0</i> tend to take on a life of their own.  A hobo sets up shop as an organist in a church converted into an office …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The world has been getting a lot more complex, most people will agree to that. A major element in that rising complexity has been the <a href="https://ea.rna.nl/2020/02/11/a-tipping-point-in-the-information-revolution/">insanely huge amounts of machine logic we human species have been adding to the world</a>. Both that logic itself, as what it enables — think globalisation of trade and communication — has made most of our lives more complex and complicated in one way or another. And while it has brought us much, it also has a serious <a href="https://ea.rna.nl/2020/03/04/gossip-trust-and-the-information-revolution/">number of unwanted side-effects</a>.</p>



<p>We run into the boundaries of our ability to handle that complexity on a daily basis. Be it the large IT projects that invariably run late, cost too much, maybe even straight out fail. Or how we must try to stay secure in a digital world full of brittleness of logic and the weaknesses of humans.</p>



<p>[Note 1: This article is meant to be understandable (with a bit of effort) by non-specialists. There is quite a bit of jargon in it, but I try my best to explain all of it, including a table below with extensive explanation of a number of key terms. If I don’t explain a term, it is safe to ignore it if you don’t know what it is (e.g. when I mention a ‘tomcat server’ as an example), it is helpful for those that know, but not really necessary to know what it is to follow the story]</p>



<p>So, it isn’t a surprise that in IT, a constant drive over the last decennia has been the drive to reduce complexity. <em>‘Reducing complexity’ sells.</em> Especially managers in IT are sensitive to it as complexity generally is their biggest headache. Hence, in IT, people are in a perennial fight to make the complexity bearable. One method that has been popular for decennia has been standardisation and rationalisation of the digital tools we use, a basic “let’s minimise the number of applications we use”. This was actually part 1 of this story: <a href="https://ea.rna.nl/2016/01/10/a-tale-of-application-rationalization-not/">A tale of application rationalisation (not)</a>. That story from 2015 explains how many rationalisation efforts were partly lies. (And while we’re at it: enjoy <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2011-01-07" target="_blank">this Dilbert cartoon</a> that is referenced therein.) Most of the time multiple <em>applications</em> were replaced by a single <em>platform</em> (in short: a platform is software that can run other software) and the <em>applications</em> had to be ‘rewritten’ to work ‘inside’ that platform. So you ended up with one <em>extra</em> platform, the <em>same</em> number of applications and generally a few new <em>extra</em> ways of ‘programming’, specific for that platform. That doesn’t mean it is <em>all</em> lies. The new platform is generally dedicated to a certain type of application, which makes programming these applications simpler. But the situation is not as simple as the platform vendors argue. As Frederick Brooks had already told us in 1986: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">There Is No Silver Bullet</a>.</p>



<p>Another drive has been to encapsulate (hide) complexity and access it through simpler interfaces. And a third has been to automate IT itself, creating complex ‘management IT’. All three play a role when we start to outsource IT to cloud services like Microsoft Azure or AWS.</p>



<p>[Note 2: This article has gotten out of hand. Totally. Quite long while I don’t digress a lot — as I often do. But exposing hidden complexity cannot be done by not presenting it to you. And not understanding how complex the real IT world is leads to bad outcomes. When the software for supporting the Covid-19 vaccination campaign was a few weeks(!) late because testing wasn’t done yet, I read about a leading politician state something like “Come on, a bit of testing, how hard can it be?”. That is a cringeworthy display of not understanding how complex IT is. And that is partly why I write this. Because until our leaders actually start to understand this, they will create more and more disasters out of ignorance. Back to the story.]</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>For non-technical people,  here is a basic explanation of terms used in the above figure and in the text.</p>



<p><span><strong>On Premises</strong></span>: Using your own hardware<br><span><strong>Application</strong></span>: Software that you use, e.g. Microsoft Word.<br><span><strong>Data</strong></span>: The data in your program, say your text in Word.<br><strong><span>Runtime</span>:</strong> Software that is required for other software to run, e.g. basic functionality for Java programs (‘Java runtime’). (Java is a programming language.)<br><span><strong>Middleware</strong></span>: More complex software that is required for other software to run but may also have its own function. E.g. a database.<br><span><strong>Operating System</strong></span>: The lowest layer of software that sits between the machine and all other software. Like Windows or macOS at home.<br><span><strong>Virtualisation</strong></span>: A way to turn one very big real ‘machine’ (computer) into many <em>virtual machines</em> by arranging multiple operating systems to share the big machine. Sharing increases efficiency because not all operating systems are busy at the same time. It also has other advantages.<br><span><strong>Server</strong></span>: The big ‘real’ machine. Like your computer at home but much bigger with multiple processors and lots of memory so it can be shared.<br><span><strong>Storage</strong></span>: Separate machine that is optimised to provide storage (disks), can be used by multiple servers. At home people sometimes have this too in the form of a NAS. These are generally ‘appliances’, that is specialised hardware (in this case with a lot of disks) with specialised software to manage them.<br><span><strong>Networking</strong></span>: Separate machine that enables data traffic between systems. Like your modem, router and Wifi Access Point at home. Again, an appliance with specialised hardware (in this case network interfaces such as wifi antennas and sockets for network cables) that has specialised software to manage these.</p>
</div>



<div>
<p>The suggestion is this: as we move away from our own IT ‘on-premises’ (which includes whatever co-hosting data center you use, in. this context it just means you own your own IT hardware) to more and more in the cloud, we are outsourcing more and more, we are responsible for less, <em>our life simplifies</em>. More cloud is cheaper, simpler and more flexible. What is there not to like?</p>



<p>What there is not to like is that this suggestion is for a large part a lie. And a nasty one.</p>



<p>Take for instance networking. According to the graphic, as soon as you move to the cloud, it’s no longer your responsibility. But that is a lie, except for the rightmost option (SAAS — more about this later). If you set up your IAAS or PAAS in the public cloud — say Microsoft Azure — you have to manage quite a bit of networking. In fact, while Microsoft runs the underlying <em>hardware</em>, much of what has to be managed, will be managed by you. You decide on segmenting, networking, VPNs (virtual private networks — a way to protect traffic between networks), routing firewalls, etc., you’re just using Azure tooling to set it up. It’s easier, but it’s far from all gone.</p>



<p>It is best explained by using an example. Suppose you open up some of your cloud-based systems to access from the public internet? You can do that. And suppose you shouldn’t have, because these systems contain sensitive data? And suppose this data is stolen in a very public breach? Who is to blame? Microsoft for providing you with enough rope to hang yourself, or you? It is clear that if this is a big news story, the heading will not be “Microsoft was lax with its security and management”, but “Company X was lax with its security and management <em>in the cloud</em>“.</p>








</div>
</div>



<p>So, the reality of the situation is therefore more like this:</p>

<p>The hardware — the iron — is indeed something that is completely handled by a cloud provider. This includes things like connecting the server to networks, power, etc., and replacing disk drives, fans, etc. In a fully self-sourced setup this actually turns out to be a limited affair. Most of the work is not hardware these days, it is software. Companies that run their own on-premises data centers don’t have a lot of data center hardware operators. Take the networking engineers. They may lay a few cables to a switch, but after that it is quickly moving to the management console and manage the appliance throughputs management interface — in other words: software work. Networking engineers, storage engineers, and compute engineers alike, their main tool is not a screwdriver, their main tool is a <em>keyboard</em>. Only the basic servers for virtual machines have little in terms of configuration. Networking and storage are <em>appliances</em>, specialised hardware with specialised software. The cloud provider has an interface on top of these that gives you that ‘enough rope to hang yourself with’, i.e. much of this is actually set up and maintained by you. Microsoft doesn’t create or manage your firewall settings, it only offers you an interface to create a virtual firewall running on their appliances and manage that <em>yourself</em>.  So it is a shared responsibility, and especially in networking: you do most of the work in much of the same way you would have to do when you were running your own appliances. Using a firewall in Azure is Microsoft spinning up a virtual appliance for you. And from that moment on, the work is all yours.</p>



<p>The only form of cloud where you really get rid of a lot of responsibility is Software-as-a-Service, or SAAS. That is because SAAS actually simplifies matters… …for the vendor. As explained in the EAPJ article <a href="http://eapj.org/vertical-integration-versus-horizontal-standardisation/">Vertical Integration versus (horizontal) standardisation</a>, the big advantage of SAAS is that the vendor of an application doesn’t need to support a myriad of technical landscapes out there, no myriad of different Linux versions, Java versions, as well as their configurations (security baselines, anyone?), just a single stack they fully manage themselves. That brings a huge standardisation for the vendor, and the advantage of that can be sold (in part) to the customer. Your responsibility is generally limited to a bit of Application tinkering (maybe add plugins, do some configuration) and of course your content. (And even the almost total outsourcing of SAAS is a little lie …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>A Polar Vortex collapse sequence has begun in late December 2020, with a major Sudden Stratospheric Warming event on January 5th, 2021. We will look at the sequence of these events, and how they can change the weather in Europe and the United States in the coming weeks.</strong></p>
<p>The main “player” in these weather events, is of course the <strong>Polar Vortex</strong>. It connects the bottom of the atmosphere (our weather) with the stratosphere above it. A strong exchange of energy between these two layers can heavily disrupt the weather development across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<h5><span><strong>WHAT IS THE POLAR VORTEX?</strong></span></h5>
<p>Since knowledge is the key, we will do a quick recap of what exactly is the Polar Vortex.</p>
<p>All of the clouds (and the weather that we feel) are found in the lowest part of the atmosphere called the <span><strong>troposphere</strong></span>. It reaches up to around 8 km (5 miles) altitude over the polar regions and up to around 14-16 km (9-10 miles) over the tropics.</p>
<p>Above it, there is a much deeper layer called the <span><strong>stratosphere</strong></span>. This layer is around 30 km thick and is very dry. We can see the layers of the atmosphere on the image below, with the <span>stratosphere</span> in green hues, and the <span>troposphere</span> in blue at the bottom.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.severe-weather.eu/wp-content/gallery/andrej-news/polar-vortex-stratosphere-weather-warming-atmospheric-layers.jpg" title="" data-src="https://www.severe-weather.eu/wp-content/gallery/andrej-news/polar-vortex-stratosphere-weather-warming-atmospheric-layers.jpg" data-thumbnail="https://www.severe-weather.eu/wp-content/gallery/andrej-news/thumbs/thumbs_polar-vortex-stratosphere-weather-warming-atmospheric-layers.jpg" data-image-id="21664" data-title="polar-vortex-stratosphere-weather-warming-atmospheric-layers" data-description="" target="_self">

</p>
<p>Every year as we head into autumn, the north pole starts to cool. But the atmosphere further south is still relatively warm as it is still receiving energy from the Sun. The north pole receives very little sunlight and thermal energy, cooling at a faster rate.</p>
<p>The reduction in temperature also means a gradual pressure drop over the north pole. In the stratosphere, the process is the same. As the temperature drops over the pole and the temperature difference towards the south increases, a low-pressure area starts to develop across the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The image below shows a typical example of the Polar Vortex at around 30km altitude (10mb level) in the middle stratosphere.</p>

<p>It is almost like a very large cyclone, covering the whole north pole, down to the mid-latitudes. The polar vortex is present at all levels, almost from the ground up. The image below shows the polar vortex at different altitudes. The closer to the ground we get, the more deformed it gets, due to the complex terrain and the many weather fronts and systems.</p>

<p>We produced a high-resolution video for you below, which very nicely shows the Polar Vortex spinning over the Northern Hemisphere. It covers the period from December 2020 to January 2021, made from NASA GEOS-5 data.</p>
<p>Video shows the 10mb level (30km altitude) potential vorticity parameter, which overly simplified means, that it shows the energy of the polar vortex. Be aware of how the energy is being taken away from the polar vortex by the invisible polar Anticyclones (having a different kind of power), spinning in the opposite direction.</p>


<h5><span><strong>SUDDEN STRATOSPHERIC WARMING</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
As a general reference, we usually look at the polar vortex in the stratosphere at the 10mb level. That is around 28-32km (17-20 miles) altitude. This is considered to be around the middle stratosphere, and thus a good representation of the general dynamics of the polar vortex.</p>
<p>The strength of the polar vortex is most often measured by the power of the winds inside it. Usually, this is done is by measuring the zonal (west to east) wind speeds around the polar circle (60°N latitude).</p>
<p>Below we have an analysis from the NASA monitoring system, where we can see a very interesting progression. In early December, the polar vortex was at a quite strong level, reaching 40m/s zonal wind speeds. Problems began towards the mid-month, and especially towards late December when the stratospheric warming began. All graphics below are at the 10mb level (~30km altitude).</p>

<p>Towards mid-December, the pressure from the North Pacific was rising, with an Anticyclonic presence there gaining strength. The anticyclonic circulation was slowly getting stronger, starting to drain some energy away from the polar vortex, and changing its shape.</p>

<p>By late December, the Pacific/East Asian Anticyclone became quite a force, now draining a lot of energy from the Polar Vortex and actually becoming visible.</p>

<p>At a similar time in late December, a warming sequence began, from Europe over into central Asia. It was starting to engulf the outside layers of the polar vortex. The cold-core of the polar vortex is still rather intact at this point, holding temperatures colder than -80°C in the center over Greenland.</p>

<p>On January 5th, the preliminary date of the Sudden Stratospheric Warming event was marked, as the winds around the polar circle have reversed. We can see how massive and strong the Anticyclone has now become, pushing strongly against the polar vortex (bright white). Together with the warming wave, the strong Anticyclonic system has deformed the once circular polar vortex into a banana-shaped feature.</p>

<p>The warming wave has crawled over the entire North Pole in the stratosphere, effectively splitting the cold-core of the polar vortex into two parts. One over North America and one over the European sector. At this point, this does not have much to do directly with the weather on the surface, as it is at 30km altitude, but we will get to weather effects soon.</p>

<p>Looking quickly at the forecast, we can see that the stratospheric Anticyclone will hold stable and move further over the North Pole. It will continue pushing against the very broken polar vortex.</p>

<p>At this point, a new warming wave is also forecasted to start, which should temporarily prevent any quick reorganization and strengthening of the stratospheric circulation.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the <a href="https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/meteorology/NH.html">NASA</a> temperature analysis for the stratosphere, we can see the large temperature spike at the 10mb (30km) level, which is in the middle stratosphere.

<p>Looking even lower, we have the 150mb level, which is kinda the boundary or the “buffer zone” between the stratosphere and the troposphere. Here we can also see the temperature spike, meaning the warming event was fairly robust and fast.</p>

<h5><span><strong>HISTORICAL WEATHER, FOR THE FUTURE</strong></span></h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Before looking closer at the weather forecasts and their relation to the polar vortex, we need to look at some historic examples of similar events. History can sometimes be the best teacher for the future, and in science, this can be true more often than not.</p>
<p>Below we have 2 images, which both are quite simple to read and understand. They show time from left to right, and altitude from bottom to top. Colors show the temperature anomaly, with red being warmer than normal and blue was colder than normal. We can nicely track the progress of stratospheric warming events over time and altitude.</p>

</p>
<p>We can see the progression of warming from the top of the stratosphere, going downwards over time. The first image shows the 2004 stratospheric warming event and the second graphic shows the 2013 event.</p>
<p>The important takeaway is that the warming progresses quite fast down into the troposphere and can start to quickly affect our weather. But it usually stops around 100mb or 150mb level (12-15km). That is normal, due to the fact that we can see a lot of strong weather systems in our troposphere, which can in some cases deflect/reverse any incoming effects from the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Below we have similar two images, but with pressure anomalies instead of temperature. But here you can actually see the connecting points between high pressure coming downwards and the surface layer in the polar region. In both cases, the final effect was seen as individual connections to the bottom levels over time, interfering with the weather development. This indicates that the influence from the Polar Vortex collapse events is periodically interfering with the weather development on a sub-seasonal scale, kinda like waving or resonating.</p>

<p>We don’t yet have the same graphic for 2021, for obvious reasons, since we still need more data to be gathered. But we can look at the forecast data in a similar image below.</p>
<p>What we are seeing is a very similar pattern as in 2004 and 2013. The negative values in this image represent higher pressure. So we can see the descending high-pressure, making individual contacts with the lower layers. This means that the influence is not a constant every time, but rather periodic.</p>

<p>We also decided to look at the weather patterns prior to the 2004 and 2013 events. And we can see in the images below. We can see on the first image for 2004, that the pattern was already positioned for colder weather over Europe, thanks to the strong high-pressure system in the North Atlantic. The United States was generally milder, with southerly flow dominating much of the CONUS.</p>

</p>
<p>In 2013, the picture was kinda the opposite. The pattern over the United States was generally colder than in 2004, while Europe was mild to warm even at this point.</p>

</p>
<p>This winter, the pattern is kinda a combination of both. We have another cooler/colder episode over Europe like in 2004, thanks to the high-pressure systems in the North Atlantic. At the same time, we also heed a few decent cold episodes over the United States as well.</p>

<p>But after the Polar Vortex breakdown and the stratospheric warming event, the pressure patterns changed quite importantly in 2004 and also in 2013. The image below is the pressure pattern one month after the Polar Vortex collapse in 2004. The strong high pressure in the North Atlantic has been replaced by a strong deep low-pressure system, and the high-pressure has moved into the Arctic …</p></div></div>

    <p>Nobody here knew quite what a year 2020 was going to be! However despite
pandemics and lockdowns, we have continued to work on Prosody. This post
is a summary of how the project is doing, and what we’ve been up to in
the past year.</p>

<p>One quick note before we begin… Prosody is an independent open-source
project and exists only because the developers have been fortunate enough
to be in a position to work on it. A couple of core team members are
currently looking for freelance work. If you have projects in need of a
Prosody expert, check the bottom of this post for more details!</p>

<h2 id="more-users-than-ever-before">More users than ever before</h2>

<p>Prosody does not “phone home” in any way, which means we do not have a
lot of insight into how many people are using Prosody. But there are
some indicators that we can use to see at least the growth of the project.</p>

<p>Many years ago, circa 2014, I was filling out a form that asked how
many users the project had. I thought long and hard, but with no idea how
to measure, I wrote down an estimate of “500” based on nothing but a gut
feeling. Only a few weeks later I learned that the <a href="https://xmpp.net/">XMPP Observatory</a>
had already seen <strong>over 2200 domains</strong> submitted that were running Prosody.
As most deployments were unlikely to have been submitted to xmpp.net, my
estimate was clearly far out. These days I jump at any chance for even a
vague estimate of our userbase. It helps us to know that people are out
there!</p>

<p>One useful tool is <a href="https://shodan.io/">Shodan</a>. This project scans the
entire internet, just to see what it can find, and it records the results.
Often used by academics and security researchers, a free account can also
be used by anyone to run simple queries over the data they collect.</p>

<p>A Shodan search in 2017 turned up nearly 7000 Prosody deployments. The
same search 8 months later returned over 16000. Today we’re at <strong>over 52000
Prosody servers!</strong> And this only counts instances using port 5269 and
accessible to the internet. There are also many private/internal deployments
of Prosody that are not included in these numbers. Unfortunately we
didn’t run a report in 2019, but here’s a graph of the previous
reports we have run:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.prosody.im/2020-retrospective/prosody-shodan-2020.svg" alt="Graph of Prosody server counts in previous paragraph"></p>

<p>Shodan reports over 85000 federating XMPP servers on port 5269 in total.
Based on this, Prosody makes up 44% of the public XMPP network. That’s
quite an achievement!</p>

<p>Another handy insight into one sector of Prosody deployments is via Debian’s
<a href="https://popcon.debian.org/">“popularity contest”</a> service. This is an
automated survey that administrators of Debian servers can choose to opt
into. It reports anonymously to Debian what software packages are installed
and in use. Although it reflects only a small slice of even Debian
installations, it is useful to see trends.</p>

<p>March 2020 marked an unprecedented spike in Prosody installations!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.prosody.im/2020-retrospective/prosody-popcon-20201231.png" alt="Graph of Debian popularity contest data for prosody"></p>

<p>Although we don’t know for certain, we suspect this was caused by an surge
of interest in the self-hosted video conferencing software, <a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Jitsi Meet integrates with Prosody, which is used to power the
authentication, signaling and chat of the video conferences. Jitsi’s <a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/">Videobridge</a> component handles the media routing. Together they make
a very powerful and flexible communication system, and it is hardly surprising
that interest has spiked this year when there has been a massive shift to
remote work, and online meetings have replaced physical ones.</p>

<h3 id="changes-in-2020">Changes in 2020</h3>

<p>In 2020 (looking at the development branch) we added 597 commits, changing
191 files. The changes added 9872 lines of code, and 3637 lines of code
were removed.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the new lines were in our unit and integration
tests (2200 lines, about 22%) which we have been working hard to expand
over the past couple of years.</p>



<p>If you use Prosody, you know we have an emphasis on modularity and
extensibility. We like to make <a href="https://prosody.im/doc/developers/modules">developing plugins for Prosody</a> as easy as possible, whether it’s for integration with other
systems or crazy experiments.</p>

<p>Here’s a random selection of the 363 modules currently in the repository:</p>

<p>During 2020 we saw 37 new modules published in the <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/">community repository</a>,
and 499 commits from 19 contributors. Together they added over 10,000
lines of code (and removed 728 lines). This makes it our most active
year apart from 2018!</p>

<p>Outside of the Prosody dev team, the most active contributor was
<a href="https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Severino_Ferrer_de_la_Pe%C3%B1ita_Application_2020">Seve</a>, who also made their first contribution this year and added a total of four new modules.
Welcome aboard!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>But the most important part… what features have we been working on? All
these things are scheduled for the 0.12 release (more on that in a bit).</p>

<h3 id="plugin-installer">Plugin installer</h3>

<p>We have been applying further polish to, and setting up the infrastructure
for the plugin installer. This was a Google Summer of Code project by
<a href="https://gsoc-prosody-2019.blogspot.com/">João Duarte</a>. It utilizes the
Lua package manager, LuaRocks, to download, install and manage community
modules.</p>

<p>Although the the installer was completed in 2019, to make it generally
usable we also had to ensure every module in the <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/">community repository</a>
could be packaged and served in an automated way by our server. We now
have this working.</p>

<h3 id="bye-bye-telnet-hello-prosodyctl-shell">Bye bye telnet, hello prosodyctl shell!</h3>

<p>The telnet console is one of the best things about Prosody, and we’ve
been working on its successor. An early version of <code>prosodyctl shell</code> is
already available to try out in trunk nightly builds.</p>

<p>Using prosodyctl allows us to more easily support advanced features such
as line editing and history (previously attainable using a third-party
utility, rlwrap). It also allows for some richer UIs and is more secure
on shared servers (it uses a unix socket instead of TCP).</p>

<h3 id="dns-improvements">DNS improvements</h3>

<p>Since Prosody needs to resolve special DNS record types (such as SRV
records) and in an asynchronous manner, the built-in operating system APIs
are generally inadequate.</p>

<p>For a long time we’ve been using an adopted library simply known as
‘dns.lua’ combined with our own asynchronous wrapper around it. Although
it hasn’t been terrible, it has a few issues, especially in some uncommon
environments. It also doesn’t support many advanced features such as DNSSEC.</p>

<p>Now we are migrating to libunbound, part of the <a href="https://github.com/coredns/unbound">unbound</a>
project. This is one of the leading DNS implementations, and will be a
big improvement over our current DNS library. To try it out, you can
simply install <a href="https://www.zash.se/luaunbound.html">luaunbound</a> (already
available in luarocks, Debian testing, AUR and others - poke your distro
maintainers if you don’t have it yet!).</p>

<h3 id="http-server-upload-performance">HTTP server upload performance</h3>

<p>We didn’t set out to write a HTTP server, but we ended up with one anyway!
Originally added so that we could natively support BOSH (XMPP over HTTP)
clients, it grew to support websockets, and various modules now provide
HTTP APIs for integration between Prosody and other systems.</p>

<p>One big problem is that the original implementation was designed for only
small amounts of data. Since the widespread of adoption of
<a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html">XEP-0363</a> people now want to
be able to upload files, pictures and videos using Prosody’s internal
HTTP server. We have limits in place to protect against denial of service
attacks, but those same limits prevent large uploads from trusted users.</p>

<p>We’ve put some work into supporting “streaming uploads”, where incoming
data can be saved directly to disk instead of RAM. This means it will be
safe to increase file upload limits without opening up your server to
increase RAM usage and denial of service attacks.</p>

<p>In general though, we do recommend using a real external HTTP server in
a production or high traffic deployment (using <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload_external">mod_http_upload_external</a>).</p>

<h3 id="beyond-passwords">Beyond passwords</h3>

<p>Passwords are the fundamental means of authenticating to your server in
XMPP today. XMPP is quite good at this, adopting strong standard authentication
mechanisms such as SCRAM far earlier than the rest of the industry. But
the rest of the industry is also moving away from passwords in many places.
We’re aiming to follow this movement also. Not that we are scrapping passwords
entirely, but making it easier to offer alternatives.</p>

<p>Prosody actually has a number of non-password authentication modules already,
such as <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_oauthbearer">mod_auth_oauthbearer</a> (OAuth2 tokens),
 <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_ccert">mod_auth_ccert</a> (client certificates) and
 <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/mod_auth_token">mod_auth_token</a> (HMAC-based
 tokens).
But most of the modules have limitations and are not well integrated
(e.g. you can set up Prosody to accept passwords, or set it up to accept
tokens, but you can’t offer both methods at the same time).</p>

<p>An important related aspect is authorization. In most systems authentication
via a token also provides <em>limited access to the account</em> (e.g. if a password
is associated with an account, a session that logged in using a token
should not be allowed to reset the password).</p>

<p>We’ve been working on two things. Firstly, a built-in authorization system
(more flexible than the current <code>admins</code> configuration option) where users
and sessions can be associated with specific permissions and roles.</p>

<p>Secondly we’re using this authorization layer to add built-in support
for OAuth2-style authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>This is exciting for a number of reasons. It will allow, for example,
specialized clients to request and receive (when granted by the user)
limited …</p></div></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>One of the many upsides I’ve had from working at lots of organisations
is that you get to see what’s common. Are things like this everywhere?
Frequently, the answer is yes!</p>

<p>An example of this is tech debt.</p>

<p>I see organisations which are running to stand still, and I’m not
sure they realised they’re doing that.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this?</p>

<p>Every time you decide to solve a problem with code, you are committing
part of your future capacity to maintaining and operating that code.
Software is never done.</p>

<p>Here’s a few examples of demonstrating what I mean:</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You write a networked service to solve a business problem. Say
it has an HTML web UI</li>
  <li>It has no known security issues</li>
  <li>Time passes</li>
  <li>You now have security issues with your code, and you should assess
 whether you need to do work to address these.</li>
</ol>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>Humans are terri-bad at writing secure code. And given enough time,
other humans will discover the security holes in your service.</p>

<p>This applies both to code your organisation writes, and the libraries
they use, or the operating systems, or web servers, or …</p>

<h3 id="security-examples">Security Examples</h3>

<p>Take your pick from browsing a CVE database, or use
<a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> or similar to look at your current codebases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TLS / SSL issues:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">POODLE</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="legislation">Legislation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You write a networked service to solve a business problem. Say
 it has an HTML web UI</li>
  <li>It has no known legal compliance issues</li>
  <li>Time passes</li>
  <li>You now have legal compliance issues with your code, and you should
 assess whether you need to do work to address these.</li>
</ol>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>
addressed organisations not handling data very well.</p>

<p>Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations – mostly known
for mandating cookie policy.</p>

<p>The Equality Act 2010 (UK) and the Americans with Disabilities Act
1990 (2010 update) for website accessibility. Yes, there was a time
when people didn’t consider accessibility when building web sites.</p>

<p>Brexit has meant a lot of changes for businesses in the EU and UK.
Software has been rewritten to manage the new trading relationships.
This will continue to happen for a while countries establish new
relationships.</p>

<h3 id="3rd-parties">3rd parties</h3>

<ol>
  <li>You write a service to solve a business problem</li>
  <li>You can build and release it when necessary</li>
  <li>Time passes</li>
  <li>You are now unable to build and release the service</li>
</ol>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>3rd parties will change their APIs, or how things work. They may
do this for any number of reasons: performance, or security among
them. Older versions become deprecated, and unsupported. And these
older versions will still have new security issues reported against
them. So you need to upgrade, and adapt your code to use the new
API.</p>

<p>People building code libraries will strive to maintain backward
compatibility. But we still get <a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a> major
version changes, and breaking API changes.</p>

<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>

<p>Most software needs constant maintenance. Building and operating
software has a cost which you should always factor in when deciding
to solve problems in that way.</p>

<p>A team working in a particular way can only be responsible for a
fixed amount of software. The amount of software should be managed,
otherwise the team will grind to a halt.</p>

<h2 id="proposition">Proposition</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A team working in a particular way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if we change how they work?</p>

<p>Well yes, there are options there.</p>

<p>I’ve got a separate post (currently brewing) about Dunbar’s numbers,
but for this post, different sized organisations might have different
options. At a certain size, it makes sense to have people dedicated
to developer productivity and creating tools which improve the
capacity of other teams.</p>

<p>You can choose higher-level languages, and use technology stacks
from SaaS vendors which need less time from your people.</p>

<p>There is one option I had planned to spend researching last year
(but I ended up getting a job instead). This feels like potentially
a big market. I’ve seen lots of organisations with decade-old
codebases which are still running unsupported versions of dependencies
or frameworks.</p>

<p>As a developer, I’m familiar with a hammer, and was curious if I
could use it.</p>

<p>Can we have tooling that automates keeping software up-to-date?</p>

<p>I see this problem in every organisation I’ve ever worked in, with
all aspects.</p>

<p>Web applications/APIs written in any language. As mentioned above,
there are many reasons that software rots if left unattended. Mobile
apps also have this. Migrating versions of Android, or iOS, or …</p>

<p>Configuration/manifests for Infrastructure as Code aslo suffer from
this. Terraform hasn’t yet released 1.x, but there have been many
changes over the years. If you’re using Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes,
you’ll <a href="https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble">have experienced
changes</a> which mean
you need to do work.</p>

<p>Automating the changes needed in YAML for upgrading from Kubernetes
<code>n</code> to <code>n+1</code> feels like a widely useful tool.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>

<p>There are some commercial things which do related work.</p>

<p>Snyk, <a href="https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate">Renovate</a>,
<a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a> and other things exist which
can make pull requests to update dependencies. Mpost languages have
a package tool and bumping numbers is pretty straightforward. These
things tend to not be able to manage breaking API changes though.
Bumping a patch or minor dependency upgrade is fine, but a major
one with breaking API changes tends to need a human to get involved.</p>

<p>Why? Could we have a tool that solves this? When a new version of
<a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a> is released, could it include an
accompanying set of transformations which will allow the entire
ecosystem to safely and rapidly upgrade?</p>

<p>Having a minor interest in compilers (and having worked on a
commercial interpreter), I tend to think of code editing operations
as transformations, rather than characters. There’s been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/prune-a-code-editor-that-is-not-a-text-editor/1012061842160013">some
research in transformation-based
editors</a>,
but I’ve not seen a lot else.</p>

<p>Major version upgrades could potentially be similarly expressed in
terms of transformations, which similarly might be composed. So if
a class has been removed between major versions of a dependency,
the required transformation might be composed of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Insert new class <code>my.Y</code></li>
  <li>Implement interface <code>spring.new.Z</code></li>
  <li>Adapt method <code>A</code> from old class <code>my.Z</code> onto method <code>B</code> in new
 class <code>my.Y</code></li>
  <li>Adapt parameters from adapted method – a <code>Context</code>
 used to be obtained from <code>ApplicationSingleton</code> but is now passed
 in explicity</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ol>

<p>And then you would need a serialisation format and publishing
mechanism for these sets of transformations.</p>

<p>The closest I’ve seen to this is where Google actually did that in
the same target langauge. They <a href="https://blog.golang.org/introducing-gofix">published a tool with for the
language Go</a>, named
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/fix/"><code>fix</code></a>. It automated upgrades of
existing code before 1.x was released, and since then, they’ve had
<a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">the Go 1 compatibility document</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, <code>fix</code> appears to have been mostly inactive since then?</p>

<p>I’m interested (academically as well as commercially) in producing
a tool which looked something similar, but much more widely applicable.</p>

<p>So having something that can take code/configuration, generate an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and then apply a set of transformations.
Transformations compose. A large one might be <strong>Upgrade Framework
<code>n</code> to <code>n+1</code></strong> involvings lots of smaller transformations. For each
transformation, you’d need to query the AST for usages of the old
API, then try to apply the transformation which maps the old API
to the new API.</p>

<p>I’ve found <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1103845.1094832">one related paper</a>.
Given that it’s not gone further, was it too hard, or not viable, or
the wrong time?</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>So I think this would be the next evolution in automated upgrades.
It’s seems like a big market – how many companies would pay for you
to solve this problem for them and allow them to concentrate on
business logic rather than plumbing concerns?</p>

<p>But I didn’t take the time off I planned to confirm the potential
market and see how hard a problem it would be solve :)</p>

<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I originally published this without a list of references.
I should have done the hard work to include them. Mostly that meant
mining my browser history and Pinboard from February and March 2019
when I spent a chunk of time first looking at this
<strong>for absolutely no reason at all, clients of the time</strong>.</p>

January 10, 2021 | https://danlebrero.com/2020/12/02/cto-diary-downsizing-team-firing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://danlebrero.com/2020/12/02/cto-diary-downsizing-team-firing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="entry-summary">On your first day as newly appointed CTO you are working on your hiring strategy, the second day your organization asks you to downsize the team.</p><div><p>A very important project that was a done deal, and that will secure the organization’s future for the next five years, failed to happen.</p><p>Not winning this project meant that the organization was forced to <em>“focus”</em> and reduce costs.</p><p>It never crossed my mind that one of the first things that I would be asked to do as an inexperienced CTO would be to fire part of the team.</p>
<p>when such bad news becomes public, host an open door day where the team can openly talk about the situation, share their feelings, see each other, feel connected, and be listened to. It would not stop the gossiping but it will help.</p><h2>Cuts and team principles</h2><p>The Dev team slice of the <em>“focus”</em> meant cutting cost by 10 to 15%. In human terms, firing two to four people (out of 17).</p><p>After some failed attempts to approach this task, this is what worked for me.</p><p>I started by listing some principles: </p>
<ul>
  <li>For each product, we need to cover the following disciplines: Frontend, Backend, Architecture, Operations, Mobile, UX, Design, QA, Leadership, and Product Management.</li>
  <li>There are broadly 3 experience levels:
  <ul>
    <li>Senior: creates the plan.</li>
    <li>Mid-level: follows the plan.</li>
    <li>Junior: needs to be taught to follow the plan.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>No number of junior people can do some work a senior person can do.</li>
  <li>Not having a senior person in a discipline will mean that the product quality will suffer:
  <ul>
    <li>If a senior creates a plan, a team of mid-level+juniors can follow the plan for some time (2-3 years?) before the product becomes a big mess.</li>
    <li>To get out of a big mess, we need senior people.
    <ul>
      <li>We are already in a big mess with Product A and Product B.</li>
      <li>With the current team, it feels Product A is getting out of the mess.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Independent (cross-functional) teams are more efficient:
  <ul>
    <li>More focus.</li>
    <li>No handoffs, faster feedback.</li>
    <li>No shared “resource” contention.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>People working in multiple products/teams are less efficient.</li>
  <li>Multidisciplinary (generalist) people:
  <ul>
    <li>Can cover the need for several of the disciplines.</li>
    <li>They can be junior in one discipline and senior in another.</li>
    <li>Allow focusing on any priority, without creating artificially important work for single-disciplined members.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Max team size: 2 pizza teams 6-8.</li>
</ul><p>The ideal team would be one that has all disciplines covered at a senior level with multidisciplinary people working in just one team, and with enough overlap to avoid a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> of one. Additional people will bring additional capacity.</p><h2>Inverse Conway’s maneuver</h2><p>We have been working on bringing three of the products together for some time. They were already under the same product manager, but they were still three teams working on their own priorities. Merging them into one team, in a classic <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/01/08/do-i-need-a-gateway-api-team-dynamics/#content">inverse Conway’s maneuver</a> would hopefully accelerate the integration between the products.</p><p>One of the other products was small enough that for this task I decided to temporarily ignore it.</p><p>Following the principles above and the product considerations, the plan was to move the previous team setup from:</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day2/old-team-structure.jpg" alt="old team structure"> </p><p>To something like (boxes represent skills, not people):</p><p><img src="https://danlebrero.com/images/blog/cto/day2/new-team-structure.jpg" alt="new team structure"> </p><p>So two products, two cross-functional teams. Platforms and design teams will be reshuffled inside those two teams.</p><h2>Which parent do you love most? A computer will tell</h2><p>With a clear plan for the team, the next step was to <em>“just”</em> pick up who will work on each team, and who we will need to let go. The most painful decision in my career. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://danlebrero.com/2019/11/27/becoming-a-technical-leader-book-notes/#content">People with a strong technical background can convert any task into a technical task, thus avoiding work they don’t want to do.</a> <cite>Jerry Weinberg, Becoming a Technical Leader</cite></p>
</blockquote><p>And I didn’t want to do the task so, consciously ignoring Mr. Weinberg, I transformed the ordeal into an optimization problem, for which I wrote an application to help me with.</p><h3>The app</h3><p>The application took as input the amount of $$$ to cut, the list of people, their salary, and the skill level on each discipline mentioned above, and outputted the possible two teams that would be within budget and match the minimum requirements, sorted by a scoring system.</p><p>The minimum requirements and scoring system configuration looked like:</p>
<pre><code>{
"FE" [at-least-senior sum-skills]
"PM" [senior-plus-somebody-else (fix-points 5)]
"Design" [two-mid-or-senior (senior-better 6 2)]
...
}
</code></pre><p>The first function filters out invalid teams while the second scores the valid ones.</p><p>In the example we say that the team has to have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least one senior FE developer. The more FE developers, the better team score.</li>
  <li>At least one senior product manager and one mid or junior one. Only one senior is not enough. No matter how many PMs the team has, the score for this discipline is 5. A team with loads of FE devs will score higher than one with loads of PMs.</li>
  <li>At least a senior designer or two mid-level designers, but we prefer one senior designer (6 points) instead of two mid-level ones (2 points).</li>
</ul><h3>The result</h3><p>As heartless as this may seem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It removed some bias. There is still bias on the skill level evaluation and in the team scoring system.</li>
  <li>I was part of the people on that list. To be honest, little consolation here. Big bias.</li>
  <li>It forced me to be very very precise on what a “functioning team” meant.</li>
  <li>It allowed me to see what different scoring systems would output.</li>
  <li>I noticed some people would never show in the output, and had to dig into why. It was enlightening.</li>
  <li>It allowed me to analyze tens of thousands of different team combinations, with different scoring systems.</li>
  <li>Programming gave me a respite from the task. This was the first time, but now I embrace more regularly “keep my sanity” programming days.</li>
</ul><p>Most important, the application gave me a few starting points. Of those, I still had to consider the team dynamics, existing teams, personalities, seniority, potential, personal situation, future needs, …</p>
<p>yes, I still have the code. No, I am not going to share it publicly. It would kill me to find there is a bug.</p><h2>Delivering the bad news</h2><p>Once the decision was made, it was time to swallow the last bitter pill.</p><p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the people affected are the first ones to know.</li>
  <li>Warn beforehand:
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use your regular one-to-one meeting slot.</li>
    <li>In your message, give a strong hint: “HR person will be in the meeting”, “Really bad news”.</li>
    <li>Give them time to get ready for the meeting.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>You don’t need to do it alone. Our HR manager was present and was a huge support for both of us.</li>
  <li>Treat people like adults.</li>
  <li>At the meeting, follow Nadia van der Vlies’ <a href="https://danlebrero.com/2020/04/01/no-nonsense-leadership-summary/#bad-news">advice</a>:
  <ul>
    <li>Deliver the blow:
    <ul>
      <li>Go straight to the bad news.</li>
      <li>Give one or two reasons.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Manage the reaction:
    <ul>
      <li>Be understanding. Do not justify yourself.</li>
      <li>Give space. Do not fill silences.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Solution, explanation, follow-up appointment:
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for the employee to be ready. When she starts asking “why” or “what now”.</li>
      <li>Reiterate reasons.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>In a couple of days follow up with another more informal meeting. The news would have sunk, and the conversation would be more forward-thinking and productive.</li>
</ul>

    <p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/erporydxmaarwcd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I recently found this piece of art (LINES 2A (2017)) created by <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerxhobbs">Tyler Hobbs</a>. This picture kinda looked very hand drawn, but it’s completely generative. Something about this drawing and it’s texture kind of resonated with me, so I wanted to try to study and replicate (or make something inspired by this work) using p5js.</p>

<p>I started out by plotting a bunch of random points within a circle like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>w = 1000
function setup() {
  createCanvas(w, w);
  background('#F9F8F4');
}

function draw() {
  x = random(w)
  y = random(w)
  if (pow(w/2 - x, 2) + pow(w/2 - y, 2) &lt; 7e4) {
    point(x,y)
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-25.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is a painfully slow process to generate random points in a circle. I found a better way to do this later. What I wanted to do next was to generate flow fields, but restricted to the circular region.</p>

<p>It’s super easy to generate flow field patterns using perlin noise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose a random point <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Plot <code>&lt;x,y&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Calculate <code>n = noise(x,y)</code></li>
  <li>Do <code>x+=cos(n * 2 * PI)</code> and <code>y+=sin(n * 2 * PI)</code></li>
  <li>Repeat 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re going to plot flow fields inside the circle. Let’s try this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const is_in_circle = (x, y) =&gt; 
  (pow(w / 2 - x, 2) + pow(w / 2 - y, 2) &lt; 7e4)

function draw() {
  if (is_in_circle(x = random(w), y = random(w)))
    while (is_in_circle(x, y)) {
      n = noise(x, y)
      x += sin(n * TAU)
      y += cos(n * TAU)
      point(x, y)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-28.png" alt=""></p>

<p>OK, not very good. The noise at this level is pretty rough. we’re going to zoom in to the noise function (by dividing the <code>x,y</code> inputs by some constant value) and probably use <code>circle(x ,y ,0.3)</code> to plot points instead if point function, because I feel it looks way smoother. Also, I’m adding a <code>random() &gt; 0.01</code> condition in the loop so that we also get short lines that are not trimmed away by the edge of the circle.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function draw() {
  if (is_in_circle(x = random(w), y = random(w)))
    while (is_in_circle(x, y) &amp;&amp; random() &gt; 0.01) {
      n = noise(x / 500, y / 500)
      x += sin(n * TAU)
      y += cos(n * TAU)
      circle(x, y, .3)
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-27.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Actually.. not bad. I think we manage almost replicate the original texture. The inverted version also looks pretty good.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-19.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/ppanets.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I went ahead and made a つぶやきProcessing version of this.</p>

<h2 id="going-further-animations">Going Further: Animations</h2>

<p>The code we wrote right now technically is animated. The animation however is not very smooth.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_03-52-31.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>To make smooth animations, we need to generate new points in the circle, keep track of these points outside the <code>draw()</code> function. I found this neat <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50746409">technique</a>, to find random points in a circle where a random radius <code>r</code> and angle <code>theta</code> are chosen and the <code>x,y</code> points are obtained as <code>x = centerX + r * cos(theta)</code> and <code>y = centerY + r * sin(theta)</code></p>

<p>Let’s try that first.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function random_point() {
  r = random(w / 4)
  t = random(TAU)
  return [
    w/2 + cos(t) * r, 
    w/2 + sin(t) * r
  ]
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas((w = 1e3), w);
  background(255)
  k = w / 2
  m = (Array(w).fill(0)).map(random_point)
}

function draw() {
  for (i = k; --i;) {
    [x, y] = m[i]
    circle(x, y, .3);
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/screenshot-from-2021-01-10-04-51-20.png" alt=""></p>

<p>and now we apply flow fields and try to move these points.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function random_point() {
  r = random(w / 4)
  t = random(TAU)
  return [
    w/2 + cos(t) * r, 
    w/2 + sin(t) * r
  ]
}

const w = 1000
function setup() {
  createCanvas(w, w);
  background('#F9F8F4')
  k = w / 2
  points = (Array(k).fill(0)).map(random_point)
}

function draw() {
  for (i = k; --i;) {
    [x, y] = m[i]
    x += sin(n = noise(x / 400, y / 400) * TAU) * h
    y += cos(n) * h
    stroke(i%255)
    circle(x, y,.3)
    if (pow(k - x, 2) + pow(k - y, 2) &lt; 7e4)  // if point is in circle
      points[i] = [x, y, t]
    else points[i] = random_point() // replace with new point if not
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_04-56-11.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>And a つぶやきProcessing version of course..</p>

<h2 id="adding-colors">Adding Colors</h2>

<p>There are many strategies to colorizing this sketch. One is by just giving each particle a random initial color.</p>

<p><img src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/download-21.png" alt=""></p>

<p>However, I found that maintaining the initial x or y position in the particle array and using that to derive the hue information gives us some nice Jupiter/gaseous planet vibes.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_05-18-19.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>The fringing at the sides can be avoided by moving 50% of the points in the reverse direction.</p>

<video loop="" autoplay="" muted=""> <source src="https://avinayak.github.io/uploads/simplescreenrecorder-2021-01-10_08-43-25.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>

<p>More color variations</p>

<p>And that’s it. Hope this was educational!</p>

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>The premise of the movie "Idiocracy" is simple: in the future mankind has de-evolved into morons. Technology does so much for everybody that nobody knows how it all works anymore. &nbsp;If we can't fix it, we're all going to die.</p><p>One character asks the other what he likes, The answer is money.</p><p>"I can't believe you like money too!" the first character says without irony, "We should hang out!"</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/JRJcXbeoSOlkRRzbC7HJ_idiocracy.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The gag here is that of course, most everybody likes money. If you reduce all of your life enough, it's just food, sex, money, and looking cool. But who would want to do that? Over the centuries, humans have created massively-complex societies because everybody has different things they like doing and thinking about, but all of that complexity can be reduced to, well, an idiocracy if you try hard enough.</p><p>The movie, however, is just a joke, right? We would never allow that to happen, of course, because that's not the goal of technology. Technology's goal is to make us better, not dumber.</p><p>Wait one. Is that true? What <em>is</em> the goal of technology, anyway? Has anybody ever clearly stated it?</p><p>Recently I've heard two goals:</p><ol><li>The goal of technology is to become a <strong>brain extension</strong>, <em>helping you to decide what to do</em> and then helping you get it done.</li><li>The goal of technology is to become a <strong>hand-held power tool</strong>, helping you accomplish the things you've <em>already decided to do</em></li></ol><p>That's not the same thing. It turns out the difference is critical.</p><p>The old goal was much simpler: make something people want. I like that goal! It boils down the job of creating technology to the most important parts, need and ability. But was that sustainable? At the end of the day, don't we always end up making some combination of stuff that either helps us <em>make decisions</em> or helps us <em>implement decisions</em> we've already made? And aren't the two fundamentally incompatible in a future society?</p><p>Yelp tells you which restaurant to go to. Your GPS automatically takes you there. These are not just different problems, they're different <em>kinds of problems</em>. Getting from point A to point B is a matter of math and geometry. Which restaurant is the best tonight? You could spend hours debating that with friends.</p><p>If you reduce anything down enough it becomes idiotic. Each piece of technology we deploy can have the goal of helping us do what we've already decided or helping us decide what to do. The first option leaves the thinking up to us. The second option "helps" us think.</p><figure><iframe width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZHCVyllnck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>You like money too? Wow! I like money! We should hang out!</p><p>Human brains are not computers. Brains are designed to help us survive and pass on our genes using the minimum amount of energy available. If the GPS takes me where I'm going, I don't need to know how to use maps anymore. So I stop knowing how to use maps. Dump those neurons, they're not needed. If Yelp picks the restaurants for me enough, I stop having nuanced preferences about restaurants. That energy expenditure is no longer needed for survival and reproduction. Dump those neurons. Over time people stop caring about the tiny details of what the difference is between a good and a great restaurant. Yelp handles that.</p><p>For some folks, who cares? It's food. Go eat it. For other folks, picking the right place can be a serious undertaking, worthy of heavy thought and consideration. But if over the years apps like Yelp boil all of that down to four or five stars, then our collective brain is not going to bother with it. Human brains are not computers. If computers do the work for us, we turn off those neurons and save energy.</p><p>Meanwhile, on social media there's currently this huge discussion. One bunch of folks says that social media is being overbearing in its censorship of fringe and sometimes hateful opinions. The other bunch of folks says social media is a festering sore full of people who are ugly, hateful, and abusive to those weakest among us. The community has to set standards.</p><p>There doesn't have to be a right and wrong here. I think the crucial thing to to understand that both sides can be entirely correct. We are dealing with the same kind of question.</p><p>All three of these topics -- whether humanity is becoming idiots or not, what the ultimate goal of technology is or should be, and how social media should work -- are intricately related. They're related because of this: <em>the platform is the enemy</em>.</p><p>The minute we create a platform for something, whether it's rating movies, tracking projects, or chatting with friends about work, as that platform takes over mindshare, <em>the assumption becomes that this is a solved problem</em>.</p><p>The telephone was great. Once we had the telephone, people didn't have to worry about how to talk to people far away anymore. Just pick up the phone. Solved problem.</p><p>Facebook is great. Once we had Facebook, people didn't have to worry about how to interact with their friends in a social setting anymore. Just click on the little FB notification (Which seems to be always flashing for some reason to get my attention) Solved problem?</p><p>But these are entirely different things! With the phone, I know who I want to call and why. I push buttons and we are connected. The tech helps me do what I've already decided to do. With Facebook, on the other hand, they get paid to show me things in a certain order. The premise is that I'm waiting (or "exploring" if you prefer) until I find something to interact with. The phone is a tool for me to use. I am the tool Facebook is using. I am no longer acting. I am reacting.</p><p>And even if they weren't paid, interacting with friends socially is an extremely complex affair. What kind of mood are they in? What's their life history? What things are bad to bring up? How does their body language look? Facebook's gimmick is "Hey, we've reduced all of this to bits and bytes, and we'll even show you what bits and bytes to look at next!"</p><p>Solved problem.</p><p>Many, many people do not use the internet, the internet uses them. And this percentage is constantly growing.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/9EBNeUmSy6TMDUpKTLL6_terminator-robot.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Just like the restaurant example, maybe that's fine. I have friends, I have opinions, who cares? It's all idle chat anyway.</p><p>That logic can be true for a bunch of things, but can't be true for <em>everything</em>. Otherwise, at some point 100 years from now, we're comparing our life values and end up saying something like "I like money too". Everything can't all be reduced down to the lowest common denominator. If it does, we all die.</p><p>Life is not a bit or byte, a number to be optimized. It's meaning we define ourselves, in ways we should not quantize.</p><p>Platforms, by their very nature, constantly send out the subtle message: <em>This is a solved problem. No further effort on your part is required here. No thinking needed.</em> Platforms resist change. They resist their own evolution by subtly poisoning the discussion before it even starts.</p><p>Are restaurant choices more or less important than which movie to watch tonight? There's no right or wrong answer to these questions. We have nice categories like restaurants and movies because currently people consider those things to be different kinds of choices. But why? If the algorithm is king, why shouldn't an algorithm determine both of those things for me? And if it does, why should I bother with worrying about which category is which?</p><p>Human brains are not computers. Let the platform decide. Energy not needed. Dump those neurons.</p><p>This is the more important point. It's not that the platforms turn what might be complex things into simple numbers, or even that they monetize attention. It's that by turning everything into numbers, over time they destroy the distinction between the categories entirely. Platforms are the enemy because they resist analysis in the areas they dominate.</p><p>Platforms turn into settled fact things that should be open for debate, like whether or not Taco Bell is a Mexican restaurant, or whether Milo is an artist with something useful to tell us. (I'm going with "no" and "no" for both of these.) More dangerously, they do the work of deciding <em>what categories various things go into</em>. This category over here is important. That category over there is not. We all make these decisions, and they're all different, and the categories each of us pays careful attention to and loves obsessing about are all different, and because we all have different viewpoints and priorities humankind advances in thousands of directions simultaneously. We survive. We evolve.</p><p>Twitter has to decide whether PERSON_X can speak or not because on the Twitter platform, that question has to have a yes or no answer based on the person. Twitter's category for deciding who can speak is "who is that?" Is that the right category for social conversations? For political conversations? For conversations about philosophy? Math? Who knows? Who cares? Twitter has decided. Solved problem.</p><p>Everybody has different things they like doing and thinking about. Different conversations and audiences have different criteria. Some problems should never be solved. Or rather more directly, some problems should never have a universal answer.</p><p>An aside: We see the same thing in programming. One bunch of folks creates various platforms in order to do the thinking for another bunch of folks. Sometimes these platforms take off and become industry standards. That's quite rare, however. Most of the time we end up training morons who can weakly code against the platform but can't reason effectively about the underlying architecture or reason for the platform to exist in the first place. In our desire to help, we harm the very people we're trying to assist -- by subtly giving them the impression that this is a solved problem. Programmers are just a decade or so ahead of the rest of us.</p><p>Popular platforms aren't just a danger economically because they control commerce. They're not just a danger politically because they selectively control and amplify political discourse. They're an extinction-level, existential danger to humans because they prevent people from seriously considering what kinds of categories are important in …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Any compiler or transpiler is doing some form of program synthesis. But “proper” program synthesis usually means generation of high level programs from scratch, given only high level problem descriptions.</p>
<p>This post is about one of the most simple and straightforward methods of automatic program synthesis: inductive synthesis based on <strong>input-output examples</strong> specification and <strong>brute-force enumerative</strong> search.</p>
<h3>Synthesis task specification</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that we want to automatically generate a program that reverses an array.</p>
<p>How to formulate this task for the automatic program generator? One option is to just describe it in natural language. But it would be quite hard to automatically parse and understand. A simpler way is to provide examples of inputs and expected outputs:</p>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>[5, 2, 7, 6] → [6, 7, 2, 5]</p>
<p>It's similar to a programmer working on a task using test-driven development, with a set of self-explanatory tescases.</p>
<h3>Brute-force search</h3>
<p>How to find a program that satisfies some input-output examples? There are several possible search strategies, but the simplest one is just with a brute force enumeration.</p>
<p>The idea is to generate all programs (within some size liimts and a limited language subset), and pick the first one that works correctly for all specified examples.</p>
<p>This is probably the least efficient approach of all, but with some additional optimizations and heuristics for reducing the search space it can actually be practical.</p>
<p>For example, an algorithm that won last year's synthesis competition <a href="https://sygus.org/comp/2019/">SyGuS-Comp 2019</a> in programming-by-examples track, is based on brute-force enumerative search strategy. As well as some previous years winners (<a href="#examples" id="ref1">EUSOLVER, Enumerative CEGIS Solver</a>). There are even some practical applications, for example brute-force search can be used for <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462174">synthesising distributed systems protocols</a>.</p>
<h3>Generating Javascript</h3>
<p>For generating and manipulating programs, code has to be represented as a data structure. This is not a problem in homoiconic languages like Lisp, but in Javascript it’s harder.</p>
<p>One simple idea (used, for example in miniMAL project <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL">https://github.com/kanaka/miniMAL</a>), is to use JSON for representing programs. In this case, JSON arrays are serving as an analog of Lisp s-expressions.</p>
<p>Similar to an s-expression, each JavaScript expression is represented as a JSON array. First element is a function name, and the rest of elements are for function arguments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong></td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong></td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Math.pow(x, 2)</td>
   <td>["Math.pow", "x", 2]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Math.pow(Math.sin(x), 2)</td>
   <td>[“Math.pow”, [“Math.sin”,  “x”], 2]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For operators, can use prefix notation:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>x = 2 + 2</td>
   <td>["=", x, ["+", 2, 2]]</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>There are some special expressions formats: control flow, variables declaration.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let x = 1
   </td>
   <td> ["let", "x", 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) { console.log(i) }
   </td>
   <td>["for”, ”i”, ”0”, ”10”, ”1”,["block", [“console.log”, “i”]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>if (i &gt; 1) { i = 1; }
   </td>
   <td>["if", [“&gt;“, “i”, 1], ["block", [“=“, “i”, 1]]]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Also need syntax conventions for calling methods, accessing properties, and indexing arrays:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>let a = new Array(0, 1, 2)
   </td>
   <td>["let", "a", ["new Array", 0, 1, 2]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a.shift()
   </td>
   <td>[".shift", "a"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n1 = a.length
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n1", [".length_", "a"]]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>let n2 = a[1]
   </td>
   <td>["let",  "n2", ["get_index", a, 1]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>a[1] = 2
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", a, 0, 0]
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This allows to represent a wide range of possible JavaScript expressions, and covers all language features needed for a simple demo.</p>
<p>Code for transforming from JSON representation to Javascript is fairly simple. It just has to traverse arrays, print out expressions elements in correct order, and deal with code formatting.</p>
<h3>Simple DSL</h3>
<p>For brute-force search to be feasible, search space has to be limited to some restricted domain-specific language subset, which depends on the kind of the target problem.</p>
<p>For example, can design a simple DSL targeted for simple array processing. It should have functions for array access and manipulation, simple arithmetics, and control flow functions.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td><strong>function</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Javascript</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>JSON</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>subtract
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? - number??
   </td>
   <td>["-", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>add
   </td>
   <td>number = number?? + number??
   </td>
   <td>["+", "number??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>greater than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &gt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&gt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>less than
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? &lt; number??
   </td>
   <td>["&lt;", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>equal
   </td>
   <td>boolean = number?? == number??
   </td>
   <td>["==", "number??", "number??", "boolean"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>array length
   </td>
   <td>number = array??.length
   </td>
   <td>[".length_", "array??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>get array element at index
   </td>
   <td>number = array??[number??]
   </td>
   <td>["get_index", "array??", "number??", "number"]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>set array element at index
   </td>
   <td>array??[number??] = number
   </td>
   <td>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>for loop
   </td>
   <td>for (let i in array??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["for", "i", ["block", "??"], "in", "array??", ""]
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>If condition
   </td>
   <td>if (boolean??) { ?? }
   </td>
   <td>["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""],
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In the DSL description, "??" stands for an undefined value, that can be replaced with an expression or a variable. This notation is taken from <a href="#sketch" id="ref2">SKETCH language</a>, where "??" represents a <em>hole,</em> a placeholder that the synthesizer can replace with an integer constant.</p>
<p>Some undefined values have annotated types. For example "number??" means that the argument should be replaced with an expression that has "number" return value. This allows for additional limitations on the search space.</p>
<h3>Algorithm for program generation</h3>
<p>How to generate all programs that can be represented with the DSL? The algorithm is fairly simple: start with some undefined values, and iteratively replace them with all possible options picked from the list of DSL expressions. Selected and pasted expressions would contain some undefined values of their own, so the process is repeated until all the options are used, or until expressions tree depth reaches some limit.</p>
<p>It’s like iterative template rewriting, and it’s easier to demonstrate with an example:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
	<td>1. Start with an empty/undefined program </td>
	<td>["??", "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>2. Traverse the expressions tree, and pick the first occurring undefined value </td>
	<td>[<span>"??"</span>, "??", "??", "??"] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>3. List all options for replacing this value (expressions that have an empty return type) </td>
	<td><span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span><br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]<br>
		["if", "boolean??", ["block", "??"], ""]
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>4. Repace undefined value with the first option </td>
	<td>[<span>["set_index", "output", "number??", "number??", ""]</span>, "??", "??" ,"??"] </td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively. Expressions tree is traversed depth-first, and each found leaf corresponds to a unique program. Press “next” button in the demo below, to see next iterations.</p>


<div id="demo2">

	<p>
		Demo: iterative program generation
	</p>

	<p>step</p>
	<p>reset</p>

	
</div>

<p>Generated programs are verified with the given input-output examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Translate from JSON represenation to Javascript</li>
<li>Fill pre-defined input array variable with an example</li>
<li>Evaluate the program with eval()</li>
<li>Check if contents of the pre-defined output variable correspond to the output example.</li>
</ol>
<p>The demo below shows program generation for "array reversal" problem. Press “generate” button to see continuous generation, or use “next” to see generation steps. It generates and checks around a million of short programs per minute, and is able so solve the problem in ~10-20s. I tweaked the DSL to have a bare minimum of available expressions, for search to be faster. Size of the program is also limited by number of used varialbes (limited to 4). It would still work with larger more generic DSL, just would take more time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2><strong>Part 3: <code>dyn Method</code></strong></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to the third and final installment of our series on how we implemented a runtime reflection system in Rust.</p>
<p>So far, we've shown how we came up with a fairly simple <code>Class</code> and <code>Instance</code> model for thinking about runtime Rust classes. In <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">Part 1</a>, we used these for type checking, and in <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2">Part 2</a> we added support for reading attributes off of a struct.</p>
<p>In this post, we pick up where we left off with attribute getters, and expand into <strong>method calls</strong>. In some ways, the same techniques we used for attributes work just as well here. We can store a map from method name to functions implementing them. However, there's a curveball: the Rust <code>Fn*</code> traits. We'll talk through the wrong turns we took, and the tidbits of Rust knowledge we picked up along the way.</p>
<h2>Method Calls</h2>
<p>Now that we have classes, instances, and attributes, the next obvious step is to add methods.</p>
<p>In oso policies, it is possible to call both class and instance methods, with and without arguments.</p>
<p>So given the struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Cat;

impl Cat {
    /// A class method (note lack of `self`).
    fn meow() -&gt; String {
       "meowww".to_string()
    }

    /// An instance method.
    fn feed(&amp;self, food: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
        if food == "tuna" { "purr".to_string() } else { Self::meow() }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We should be able to write policy logic:</p>
<pre><code>favourite_food(cat: Cat, food) if cat.feed(food) != Cat.meow();
</code></pre>

<p>Which says that the input <code>food</code> is the cat's favourite food if the result of feeding the cat is not the same as the result of the cat meowing.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Zero arguments</h3>
<p>Let's start with a simple implementation for methods that take <em>zero</em> arguments. The approach for implementing zero-argument methods is extremely similar to how we'd implement attribute getters, and we've actually done this already in Part 2:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
    ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    methods: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, InstanceMethod&gt;
}

struct InstanceMethod(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, we need to add a method onto our <code>ClassBuilder</code> struct to allow us to register new methods:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn add_method&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
where
    F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
    R: crate::ToPolar,
{
    self.class.methods.insert(name, InstanceMethod::new(f));
    self
}
</code></pre>

<p>Super easy! End of blog post. See you next time 😎 </p>
<p>But wait, what about methods with multiple arguments?</p>
<h3>Step 2: Multiple Arguments and the <code>Fn*</code> traits</h3>
<p>Let's take what we have above and add in support for multiple arguments.</p>
<pre><code>struct InstanceMethod(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance, Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>This mostly works for what we need! Polar doesn't care about method arities (how many arguments the method accepts) – it will send over however many arguments it has as a vector. Polar supports both variable number of arguments (varargs) and keyword arguments (kwargs). The latter is only supported for host languages that also have that concept, and Rust does not.</p>
<p>But this isn't the end of the story. The crucial part of the <code>AttributeGetter</code> interface was that you could pass in any method or closure for the attribute getter, and the <code>AttributeGetter::new</code> method handled all the type-conversions transparently. This hid the messy, error-prone details from the user and kept the interface clean.</p>
<p>So let's do the same for <code>InstanceMethod</code>!</p>
<pre><code>impl InstanceMethod {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, ???&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T, ???)
        F::Result: ToPolarResult,
        T: 'static,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(
            move |receiver: &amp;Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;| {
                let receiver = receiver
                    .downcast()
                    .map_err(|e| e.invariant().into());
                // ermm.... what next?
            },
        ))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We've hit our first problem.</p>
<p>The input to an attribute getter never accepted any arguments, and we only needed it to work for all <code>Fn(&amp;T)</code>. In order to support <em>multiple arguments</em>, we now need to cover <code>Fn(&amp;T)</code>, <code>Fn(&amp;T, A)</code>, <code>Fn(&amp;T, A, B)</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>The first problem is how to convert <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, etc. into <code>PolarValue</code>s.</p>
<p>The second problem is that these are all <em>completely distinct traits</em>. There is no trait capturing "functions of arity 2, 3, 4...". –&nbsp;at least not until the feature is available in stable Rust. In the future, this <em>might</em> be represented with the syntax <code>Fn&lt;Args, Output=T&gt;</code>, but right now using this syntax results in:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0658]: the precise format of `Fn`-family traits' type parameters is subject to change
 --&gt; src/main.rs:2:14
  |
2 |     where F: Fn&lt;(u32,), Output=u32&gt; {
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: use parenthetical notation instead: `Fn(u32) -&gt; u32`
  |
  = note: see issue #29625 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29625&gt; for more information
</code></pre>

<p>We could opt to use Rust nightly to get these features, but it's not a huge stretch to implement them ourselves.</p>
<h3>Implementing our own <code>Method</code> trait</h3>
<p>This is where as the writer it's tempting to unveil my newly-created trait, perfectly matching what we needed, and make it look like I just put fingers to keyboard to get to the definition.</p>
<p>In reality, we spent a sizeable chunk of our engineering effort for this project on this one trait. We made mistakes. We wrote code that we threw out. And a lot of that is because we didn't understand some of the nuances of Rust functions and the trait resolution system. Instead of papering over all of that, we thought it would be more interesting to show you what we tried. </p>
<p><strong>Attempt #1</strong></p>
<p>The first thing we tried was, in hindsight, a little greedy. Why not just skip straight to writing a trait to encapsulate precisely what we need?</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Method {
   fn invoke(&amp;self, receiver: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This looks great, let's try implementing it for one of our <code>Fn</code> variants:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F, T, R&gt; Method for F
where
   F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
   T: 'static,
   R: ToPolarValue,
{
    fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast::&lt;T&gt;().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Results in:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F, T, R&gt; Method for F
        ^ unconstrained type parameter
the type parameter `T` is not constrained by the impl trait, self type, or predicates

impl&lt;F, T, R&gt; Method for F
           ^ unconstrained type parameter
the type parameter `R` is not constrained by the impl trait, self type, or predicates
</code></pre>

<p>It's likely that most people have hit some variation of this error in their Rust adventures! What is going on here? <code>T</code> and <code>R</code> <em>look</em> pretty constrained to me? They are right there inside the definition of <code>F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>Our mistake was reading those trait bounds as: <code>F</code> is a function from <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>R</code>, whereas in reality this is a regular old trait bound with slightly different syntax for the trait itself. And one function might implement multiple of these trait bounds.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<pre><code>// do nothing
fn ident&lt;T&gt;(t: T) -&gt; T { t }

let _ = &amp;ident as &amp;dyn Fn(u32) -&gt; u32;
let _ = &amp;ident as &amp;dyn Fn(String) -&gt; String;
</code></pre>

<p>So which trait should we use for the implementation of <code>Method</code> for <code>ident</code>?</p>
<p>Here's another way of looking at this problem. Suppose instead we decided to exhaustively implement our <code>Method</code> trait for all types we care about:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;F&gt; Method for F
where
   F: Fn(&amp;u32) -&gt; u32,
{
    fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast::&lt;u32&gt;().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}

impl&lt;F&gt; Method for F
where
   F: Fn(&amp;String) -&gt; String,
{
    fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast::&lt;String&gt;().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ignoring for now just how bad an idea this is, it doesn't even work! We get:</p>
<pre><code>conflicting implementations of trait `Method`:
</code></pre>

<p>Look back to <code>ident</code>. That one function implements both <code>Fn(String) -&gt; String</code> and <code>Fn(u32) -&gt; u32</code> traits. Similarly, in the above case, a function that implements both <code>Fn(&amp;String) -&gt; String</code> and <code>Fn(&amp;u32) -&gt; u32</code> would have two possible implementations for <code>Method</code>. So we get conflicting implementations.  </p>
<p><em>Actually</em>, it goes even further than that. Implementing a blanket trait implementation over <em>any</em> two function trait bounds results in conflicting implementations. Even though such a function couldn't exist:</p>
<pre><code>trait Test {}

impl&lt;F: Fn()&gt; Test for F { }
impl&lt;F: Fn(String) -&gt; String&gt; Test for F { }
</code></pre>

<p>Results in:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0119]: conflicting implementations of trait `Test`:
  |
4 | impl&lt;F: Fn()&gt; Test for F { }
  | ------------------------ first implementation here
5 | impl&lt;F: Fn(String) -&gt; String&gt; Test for F { }
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ conflicting implementation
</code></pre>

<p>One day (or today, if you're on Rust nightly), Rust might let you implement <code>Fn</code> for your own types, support variadic functions (what do you mean Rust already supports <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html#variadic-functions">variadic functions</a>?), and do all kinds of fun things of the sort. But for now we're not going to get much farther with this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Attempt #2</strong></p>
<p>This <code>Method</code> trait looks too convenient to throw away entirely at the first sign of complication. Let's try something different. If our original mistake was thinking of <code>Fn</code> as a function instead of a trait, perhaps we can heed the wisdom of the Rust docs and use <code>fn</code> instead.</p>
<p><img alt="Building%20a%20runtime%20reflection%20system%20for%20Rust%20(Par%20e9d46e4c771847e7ba119df92cf2a8b9/Untitled.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/runtime-reflection-pt-3/Building%20a%20runtime%20reflection%20system%20for%20Rust%20%28Par%20e9d46e4c771847e7ba119df92cf2a8b9/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Based on the docs, we can use <code>fn</code> with both regular functions and closures! Great, let's do just that:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T, R&gt; Method for fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R
where
    T: 'static,
    R: ToPolarValue,
{
     fn invoke(&amp;self, instance: Instance, args: Vec&lt;PolarValue&gt;) -&gt; PolarValue {
        debug_assert!(args.is_empty());
        let receiver = instance.downcast().unwrap();
        self(receiver).to_polar()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Works fine! Let's try it out:</p>
<pre><code>let clone = |receiver: &amp;String| -&gt; String { receiver.clone() };
let clone_method: Box&lt;dyn Method&gt; = Box::new(clone);
let …</code></pre></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When retrieving logs from an application, you are often looking for outliers
(such as a unique error) or what pattern occurs the most. However, defining
patterns manually is time-consuming and requires rigour across projects. In
this series of blog posts, we are going to explore automated Log Pattern
Recognition.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I recently began using <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/patterns/">Datadog Log Pattern</a>
and became addicted to it. Unfortunately, I was not able to find such a feature on
Kibana or a query proxy able to do this analysis. If that does not exist, I
might as well learn more about it and make one!</p>

<p>To my surprise, I did not find as many papers as I thought I would. And the
number of papers with public implementations is even lower. Our series begins
with a paper called <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/Papers/LogMine.pdf">LogMine: Fast Pattern Recognition for Log Analytics</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/trungdq88/logmine">an implementation made by Tony Dinh</a>
that helped me a lot to study LogMine’s behavior.</p>

<p>To my surprise, I searched for anything related to LogMine on Hacker News
and only found Tony Dinh’s submission.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-terms-used-in-this-article">Defining the terms used in this article</h2>

<p>Some terms used in this article can have several meanings. In Logmine’s context,
the terms I use mean:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>log</code>: a log line (<code>string</code>)
    <div><div><pre><code>12:00:00 - My awesome log
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><code>pattern</code>: Expression extracted by the algorithm (array of <code>field</code>)
    <div><div><pre><code>[&lt;date&gt;, "-", "My", "awesome", "log"]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><code>field</code>: Part of a <code>pattern</code> / Word from a <code>log</code> (Either a fixed value, a wildcard or a <code>variable</code>)</li>
  <li><code>cluster</code>: represents a group of logs that were identified as close to each
others</li>
  <li><code>variable</code>: a user-provided regex used to identify a known format
    <div><div><pre><code>number = \d+
time = \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-logmine">An introduction to LogMine</h2>

<p>The LogMine paper describes a method to parse logs, group them into clusters and
extract patterns without any prior knowledge or supervision. LogMine can be
implemented using MapReduce and works in a single pass over the dataset.</p>

<p>LogMine’s approach to grouping logs roughly works by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parsing logs into patterns</li>
  <li>Grouping patterns into clusters if the <a href="#clustering">distance</a> between them is small</li>
  <li>Merging clusters into a single pattern</li>
  <li>Repeat from step 2 until you are satisfied</li>
</ol>

<p>LogMine classifies fields into three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Fixed value</code>, a field that is constant across all logs in a cluster. This is
detected at the pattern extraction step.</li>
  <li><code>Variable</code>, a field that matches a pattern provided by the user. This is
detected at the pre-processing step.</li>
  <li><code>Wildcard</code>, a field that is not constant across all logs in a cluster. This is
detected at the pattern extraction step.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s illustrate how it works, step by step, using three simple logs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10:00:00 - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
10:30:00 - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
11:11:11 - [ERROR] - An error occurred while disconnecting user 456
12:12:12 - [DEBUG] - User 789 disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will also define a variable <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> that follows the pattern
<code>\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}</code>.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>A good practice would be to define more variables to avoid forming two clusters
from logs with low similarity. For instance, we <strong>should</strong> define <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>
as <code>\d+</code>.</p>

  <p>Depending on the pattern of your logs, defining a common field like <code>&lt;log-level&gt;</code>
as <code>[(DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR)]</code> might end up hiding information. This is
because a <code>WARNING</code> log with an error message might not be that important yet
the same log message with an <code>ERROR</code> level might have the exact information
you would like to highlight.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="log-parsing-and-dense-clusters-identification">Log parsing and dense clusters identification</h3>

<p>The first step is to parse logs into patterns and identify dense clusters. Dense
clusters are clusters where <strong>raw logs are almost identical</strong>.</p>

<p>To do this, we begin by splitting logs into patterns (an array of field). The
separator used by default is any whitespace character.</p>

<p>I stopped at the word <code>while</code> for readability reasons, but there’s no limit to
the number of fields.</p>

<h4 id="identifying-dense-clusters">Identifying dense clusters</h4>

<p>Once this transformation is done, we will reduce these patterns into dense
clusters. Identifying dense clusters can be seen as a special use-case of the
clustering algorithm: we identify clusters but <strong>we skip the pattern extraction
step as these patterns are nearly identical</strong>.</p>

<p>As such, I’ll first introduce the clustering algorithm and the notion of
distance between patterns.</p>

<h3 id="grouping-patterns-into-clusters">Grouping patterns into clusters</h3>

<p>The clustering algorithm takes a list of patterns and identifies patterns that
are close to each other. Both the Tony Dinh’s implementation and the paper uses
the distance defined as:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Dist</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mtext>Min</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></munderover><mfrac><mrow><mtext>Score</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mtext>Max</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo><mtext>len</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Dist}(P,Q) = 1 -

<p>If the distance between the two patterns is inferior to a threshold <code>MaxDist</code>
defined internally, then the two patterns are considered a member of the same
cluster.</p>

<div>
  <p>This comparison process can be optimized by skipping unnecessary work if the
sum is already greater than our <code>MaxDist</code>.</p>

  <p>This is valid because the elements inside the sum can’t be negative.</p>
</div>

<p>The scoring function proposed in the paper allows for tweaking weights depending
on the field type.</p>

<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Score</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">{</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.3599999999999999em" columnalign="left left" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mtext>if&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>and&nbsp;both&nbsp;are&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;values</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mi>k</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mtext>if&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>and&nbsp;both&nbsp;are&nbsp;variable</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mn>0</mn></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mtext>otherwise</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Score}(x, y) =

  k2 &amp;\text{if } x=y &amp;\text{and both are variable} \\
  0 &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>In order to keep performance, the scoring function can’t return a negative
value. Therefore <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code> can’t be negative.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>The definition of this scoring function seems to have left some place for interpretation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tony Dinh’s implementation <a href="https://github.com/trungdq88/logmine/blob/a7595c6a0b313b43969199c18465cc8bec3b57d1/src/line_scorer.py#L29">checks for equality</a>
if both value are fixed values.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/logpai/logparser/blob/master/logparser/LogMine/LogMine.py">LogPai’s LogParser</a> dropped the concept of variables and uses k2 to tune wildcards weight</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p>Let’s define <code>k1=1</code> and <code>k2=1</code>, these are the weight used by Tony Dinh’s
implementation and recommended by the original paper.</p>

<h4 id="applying-the-clustering-algorithm">Applying the clustering algorithm</h4>

<p>For this example, I will use the original paper recommendation (<code>MaxDist=0.01</code>).
The MaxDist parameter is used to tune the algorithm sensitivity: the higher
<code>MaxDist</code>, the more patterns are detected.
If <code>MaxDist</code> is too high, patterns are grouped into very large clusters and
pattern extraction become meaningless.</p>

<div>
  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>

  <p>As we are using <code>MaxDist=0.01</code>, and since the logs in my example are very short,
we will only identify logs that are identical. For this reason, <strong>we can use the
clustering algorithm to identify dense clusters</strong> by skipping the pattern
recognition step.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="pattern-detection">Pattern detection</h3>

<p>In sequential (as opposed to MapReduce) mode, each time a pattern is inserted
in a cluster, LogMine will try to extract patterns from them. LogMine knows
only how to identify two types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed values</li>
  <li>Wildcards</li>
</ul>

<p>While it seems rather strict, remember that the early pattern detection during
tokenization already took care of identifying user-defined patterns.</p>

<div>
  <p>Generating the pattern each time a new pattern is added allows LogMine to only
keep one representative for each cluster. This is a very important factor to
reduce memory usage.</p>

  <p><strong>MapReduce behavior is described later in this article.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>As patterns in the same cluster can have a different number of fields, the paper
uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm">Smith-Waterman</a>
algorithm to align them. The Smith-Waterman is mainly used in Bioinformatics to
align sequences. It is interesting to see an algorithm like this applied to
log pattern recognition.</p>

<p>Once the two patterns are aligned, we compare one by one the field:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the value is equal, we assign a fixed value</li>
  <li>If the value is different, we assign a wildcard pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>The Smith-Waterman algorithm adds placeholders to align logs. These placeholders
are <strong>never equal</strong> to a field value. This means that aligned parts of a log are
always identified as wildcards.</p>

<p>The output of the pattern detection algorithm is a <strong>new list of patterns</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s assume that the previous algorithm identified a cluster with two patterns:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 789 disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="result-of-applying-the-smith-waterman-algorithm">Result of applying the Smith-Waterman algorithm</h4>

<p>Because examples in this article would have gotten very complex, I decided to
not use non-aligned logs in my examples. However, you might be curious as to how
the Smith-Waterman works.</p>

<p>On the implementation, LogMine would have aligned the two following patterns by
adding a <code>None</code> value in a field. For instance:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 has disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>would become:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 &lt;None&gt; disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 has disconnected
</code></pre></div></div>

<div>
  <p><strong>The Smith-Waterman does not understand patterns</strong>. The Smith-Waterman uses
the same scoring function as the clustering algorithm. As such, if two fields
are not equal, there is no guarantee that the placeholder will be inserted
properly.</p>

  <p>If we tweak our previous example to:</p>
  <div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 456 has disconnected
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>The Smith-Waterman algorithm would transform it to:</p>
  <div><div><pre><code>&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User &lt;None&gt; 123 disconnected
&lt;time&gt; - [DEBUG] - User 456 has disconnected
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>The alignment was added <strong>before</strong> the user identifier.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="repeat-until-satisfied">Repeat until satisfied</h3>

<p>As the pattern extraction algorithm returns a list of patterns, we can relax
<code>MaxDist</code> and feed this list back into the clustering algorithm.</p>

<p>In <strong>3.4 Hierarchy of Patterns</strong>, the paper describes a process to generate a
hierarchy of possible patterns from very strict to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <p><span>04 Jan 2021</span></p><p>Over the holidays, I got a <a href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/oh1-optical-heart-rate-sensor">Polar OH1+</a> as a Christmas present. Its an optical heart rate monitor with similar tech to those found in smart watches (including my Garmin running watch), but much more accurate (at least for running) due to being smaller &amp; lighter, as well as fitting against the fleshier upper arm:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcdav.is/public/oh1-small.jpg" alt="Polar OH1"></p>

<p>Like any modern gadget these days, it supports Bluetooth (specifically Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE/BTLE) for talking to your phone and/or smart watch. Which got me wondering, will it pair with a computer?</p>

<p><img src="https://jcdav.is/public/bluetooth.jpg" alt="It pairs"></p>

<p>This piqued my curiosity. I had long been at least somewhat curious about tracking my heart rate while say playing video games, if nothing else for curiosity. So how easy is it to grab data from this thing? As with the last few years, I had spent a bit of December doing a bunch of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> in rust, only to forget and have to re-learn everything the next year. So figured I could maybe try my hand at a “real” project.</p>

<p>Some quick googling later, I found the promising-looking <a href="https://crates.io/crates/btleplug">btleplug</a> crate. Lets dump data from all nearby devices…</p>

<p>(Note that though this part should work cross-platform, I couldn’t get bluetooth working from WSL, so this was all done natively on Windows).</p>

<p>Sure enough, among the shockingly large list of nearby devices is my new toy:</p>

<p>Let’s see what characteristics it supports:</p>

<p>Which of these do I want? The <a href="https://btprodspecificationrefs.blob.core.windows.net/assigned-values/16-bit%20UUID%20Numbers%20Document.pdf">Bluetooth UUID specifications</a> lists a bunch of different potentially interesting IDs, but they are all 16 bits, whereas are 128 bit. Making matters more confusing, <code>btleplug</code> ‘s UUID definition seems to allow for either:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>B16</span><span>(</span><span>u16</span><span>),</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However it seems like a lot of them seem to only differ in the 3rd and 4th bytes <sup><a href="#suff1">1</a></sup>, and those to roughly correspond to GATT Characteristic Ids, and in there is a <code>2A:37</code>, which represents Heart Rate Measurement - sounds promising.

<p>At least that second number sure looks like a heart rate reading. To confirm this, I hopped over to the technical specifications for the Heart Rate Service (downloadable <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/">here</a>). Sure enough, byte 0 represents various flags and byte 1 is a heart rate measurement. The spec authors have even figured out support for heart rates &gt;255 on off chance you ever slap one of these bad boys on a hummingbird:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.1.1.2Heart Rate Measurement Value Field</p>

  <p>The Heart Rate Measurement Value field shall be included in the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic. While most human applications require support for only 255 bpm or less, special applications (e.g. animals) may require support for higher bpm values. If the Heart Rate Measurement Value is less than or equal to 255 bpm a UINT8 format should be used for power savings. If the Heart Rate Measurement Value exceeds 255 bpm a UINT16 format shall be used. See 3.1.1.1.1for additional requirements on the Heart Rate Value format change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other potentially interesting bit flags include a way to indicate if the sensor thinks it has lost skin contact.</p>

<p>Now its time to figure out a UI. Faced with a <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">large number of different options</a>, I ended up settling on the not-even-listed-there <a href="https://crates.io/crates/native-windows-gui">native-windows-gui crate</a> , throwing cross-platform support into the wind on the suspicion I would need easy access to the underlying win32 APIs, since it is largely just a series of nice convenience abstractions over those. Using the associated native-windows-derive macro crate, I had a basic UI setup working fairly quickly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Default,</span> <span>NwgUi)]</span>

      <p>Without further ado, I present: a basic whitted ray tracer, complete with multicore rendering, written in 100% pure CMake. If you don't care about the details, and just want to see the code, you can <a href="https://github.com/64/cmake-raytracer">find it here</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>At this point, those familiar with CMake may have some questions, so keep reading to find out how it all works.</p>

<p><strong>Good news:</strong> CMake has a <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/math.html?highlight=math"><code>math</code></a> command. <strong>Bad news:</strong> it only supports integers. If you've written a ray tracer before, you probably did it with floating point numbers. So how do you go from representing signed integers to representing something-resembling-floating-point numbers? One answer is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic"><strong>fixed-point arithmetic</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea with fixed point is simple. We define some large integer to represent the number 1.0; let's choose <strong>1000</strong>. Then we can represent 2.0 as 2000, 0.5 as 500, -3.0 as -3000 etc. When we want to add two numbers, we simply add their fixed-point representations. Here's how that looks in CMake:</p>
<pre><span>function(add a b res)
    math(EXPR tmp </span><span>"(${</span><span>a</span><span>}) + (${</span><span>b</span><span>})"</span><span>)
    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" "${</span><span>tmp</span><span>}" </span><span>PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()
</span></pre>
<p>This takes two values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to be added and stored in the variable <code>res</code>. I use <code>PARENT_SCOPE</code> so that the variable we create is actually visible from the calling function, otherwise CMake will destroy it when the function ends.</p>
<p>To multiply two numbers, we simply multiply their fixed-point representations, and then divide by the thing we chose to represent 1.0:
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4.0</mn><mo>↦</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1500</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4000</mn></mrow><mn>1000</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>6000</mn><mo>↦</mo><mn>6.0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5 \times 4.0 \mapsto \frac{1500 \times 4000}{1000} = 6000 \mapsto 6.0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Division is similar:
<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1.5</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>4.0</mn><mo>↦</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1500</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1000</mn></mrow><mn>4000</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>375</mn><mo>↦</mo><mn>0.375</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1.5 \div 4.0 \mapsto \frac{1500 \times 1000}{4000} = 375 \mapsto 0.375</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
We could have multiplied by 1000 after doing the division, but as integer division rounds towards zero this would wipe out all our precision (as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1500</mn><mn>4000</mn></mfrac><mo>×</mo><mn>1000</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1000</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1500}{4000}\times 1000 = 0 \times 1000 = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). Multiplying first gives us better results, as long as the dividend isn't too huge (which would cause overflow).</p>
<p>CMake's <code>math</code> command only supports basic integer arithmetic. For more complicated operations, like square root, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton-Raphson iteration</a>. You can read more about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method">here</a>, but the basic idea is to make a 'guess' as to what the output should be then iteratively refine the guess towards the answer. This gives a surprisingly accurate result within only three or four iterations, subject to the quality of the initial guess:</p>
<pre><span>function(sqrt x res)
    div_by_2(${x} guess)

    </span><span>foreach</span><span>(counter RANGE 4)
        </span><span>if</span><span>(${guess} EQUAL 0)
            set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" </span><span>0 PARENT_SCOPE)
            return()
        </span><span>endif</span><span>()

        div(${x} ${guess} tmp)
        add(${tmp} ${guess} tmp)
        div_by_2(${tmp} guess)
    </span><span>endforeach</span><span>()

    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" "${</span><span>guess</span><span>}" </span><span>PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()

</span><span># sqrt(123) = 11.09072626, actual answer is 11.0905365064
</span></pre>
<p>I also implemented a similar function for computing <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msqrt><mi>x</mi></msqrt></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> separately as I found that it lead to better numerical stability, as opposed to computing the square root as above and then doing the reciprocal. This comes in handy when we need to normalize vectors.</p>
<p>Almost everything in computer graphics is done with vectors, so I started implementing vector operations: <code>vec3_add</code>, <code>vec3_mul</code>, <code>vec3_div</code>, <code>vec3_dot</code> etc. These make use of CMake built-in lists, which are pretty horrible, but save me from having to use three separate variables to keep track of the individual components of each vector. For example, here's what the dot product looks like:</p>
<pre><span>function(vec3_dot x y res)
    list(GET ${x} 0 x_0)
    list(GET ${x} 1 x_1)
    list(GET ${x} 2 x_2)
    list(GET ${y} 0 y_0)
    list(GET ${y} 1 y_1)
    list(GET ${y} 2 y_2)
    mul(${x_0} ${y_0} z_0)
    mul(${x_1} ${y_1} z_1)
    mul(${x_2} ${y_2} z_2)
    add(${z_0} ${z_1} tmp)
    add(${tmp} ${z_2} tmp)
    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" </span><span>${tmp} PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()
</span></pre>
<p>And here's how we'd use it to normalize a vector:</p>
<pre><span>function(vec3_normalize x res)
    vec3_dot(${x} ${x} x_2)
    rsqrt(${x_2} one_over_length)
    vec3_mulf(${x} ${one_over_length} tmp)
    set(</span><span>"${</span><span>res</span><span>}" </span><span>${tmp} PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()
</span></pre>
<p>As well a few other bits and bobs, like <code>clamp</code> and <code>truncate</code>, that's all the arithmetic that's needed.</p>

<p>If you're new to ray tracing, I'd refer you to <a href="https://twitter.com/peter_shirley">Peter Shirley's</a> wonderful book series '<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>', which my code is loosely based on. The general intuition is to trace rays out from the camera into the scene and see what they intersect. Since we represent all our scene geometry and rays as mathematical objects, computing intersections between rays and geometry is just a case of solving equations. Once we have found an intersection, we compute the color of the point we intersected with, which may itself be computed by tracing rays towards light sources or towards other scene geometry.</p>

<p>To keep it simply I went with a simple scene consisting of a sphere sitting atop an infinite plane in a checkerboard color. I also ended up faking the shadow underneath the sphere, simply drawing a black circle (well done if you spotted it from the image). I had implemented whitted ray tracing and even path tracing at one point, but they were much more complicated and performed a lot worse for the same result. In theory, though, there's no reason why I couldn't do it properly, it would just require some additional effort and patience.</p>
<p>Here's what the main 'trace' function looks like, with some of the unnecessary bits stripped out for clarity:</p>
<pre><span># Traces a ray into the scene, computes the color returned along the ray
</span><span>function(trace ray_origin ray_dir depth color)
    </span><span># Base case for recursion
    </span><span>if</span><span>(${depth} GREATER_EQUAL 3)
        return()
    </span><span>else</span><span>()
        math(EXPR depth </span><span>"${</span><span>depth</span><span>} + 1"</span><span>)
    </span><span>endif</span><span>()

    </span><span># Calculate intersection points with the sphere and plane
    </span><span>sphere_intersect(${ray_origin} ${ray_dir} hit_t_1 hit_point_1 hit_normal_1)
    plane_intersect(${ray_origin} ${ray_dir} hit_t_2 hit_point_2 hit_normal_2)

    </span><span># Did we hit the sphere?
    </span><span>if</span><span>(${hit_t_1} GREATER ${ray_epsilon})
        </span><span># Calculate reflected ray direction
        </span><span>offset_origin(hit_point_1 hit_normal_1 new_origin)
        vec3_dot(hit_normal_1 ${ray_dir} scalar)
        mul_by_2(${scalar} scalar)
        vec3_mulf(hit_normal_1 ${scalar} refl_a)

<p>When I started, I wouldn't sure if it would be possible to do in pure CMake, but with a little trickery we can manage it.</p>
<p>For <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> processes, the basic plan is to divide up the image vertically and let each sub-process render a few rows. We can invoke sub-processes with the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/execute_process.html"><code>execute_process</code></a> command, passing arguments (such as the worker index) via <code>-D</code>. Each process then spits their row data into a text file, which gets merged together by the master process once they've all finished.</p>
<p>One subtlety is that as we need all the sub-processes to run in parallel, we can't simply call <code>execute_process</code> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times, as it would run them sequentially. Luckily, we can specify multiple processes to run simultaneously in one command (I think this is intended to be used for long chains where one program is piped into the next), but in order to avoid hardcoding <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we have to programmatically construct the call to <code>execute_process</code> with CMake's <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/command/cmake_language.html"><code>EVAL CODE</code></a> feature (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/martty/vuk">martty</a> for this idea):</p>
<pre><span>message(STATUS </span><span>"Launching ray tracer with ${</span><span>num_procs</span><span>} processes, ${</span><span>image_width</span><span>}x${</span><span>image_height</span><span>} image..."</span><span>)

set(exec_command </span><span>"execute_process(</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)
</span><span>foreach</span><span>(worker_index RANGE 1 ${num_procs})
    set(exec_command </span><span>"${</span><span>exec_command</span><span>}COMMAND cmake . -Wno-dev -Dworker_index=${</span><span>worker_index</span><span>} -Dimage_width=${</span><span>image_width</span><span>} -Dimage_height=${</span><span>image_height</span><span>} -Dnum_procs=${</span><span>num_procs</span><span>}</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)
</span><span>endforeach</span><span>()

</span><span># Begin the worker processes
</span><span>cmake_language(EVAL CODE ${exec_command})

message(STATUS </span><span>"Finished ray tracing, gathering results..."</span><span>)
</span></pre>
<p>As per <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a>, I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#PPM_example">PPM image format</a>. This is a really simple text-based format which is perfect for my purposes as I don't have to bother with compression. Once we're done rendering we simply read all the data that the workers have spat out, write the PPM header, and print everything to <code>stderr</code>:</p>
<pre><span>set(image_contents </span><span>"P3 ${</span><span>image_width</span><span>} ${</span><span>image_height</span><span>}</span><span>\n</span><span>255</span><span>\n\n</span><span>"</span><span>)

</span><span>foreach</span><span>(worker_index RANGE 1 ${num_procs})
    file(READ </span><span>"worker-${</span><span>worker_index</span><span>}.txt" </span><span>file_contents)
    set(image_contents </span><span>"${</span><span>image_contents</span><span>}${</span><span>file_contents</span><span>}"</span><span>)
</span><span>endforeach</span><span>()

message(</span><span>"${</span><span>image_contents</span><span>}"</span><span>)
</span></pre>
<p>The division of work among the worker processes is pretty sub-optimal as the rows towards the top of the image are mostly empty whereas the rows at the bottom are entirely full, which means that some processes finish very fast while others take much longer. Fixing this problem is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<h2>Deep neck flexor exercises</h2>
<br>
<h3>Why train them?</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_1.jpg"></p><p>The deep neck flexor muscles sit deep in the front of the neck, behind the trachea (windpipe). Because of their close proximity to the vertebrae (spine) and their short length, they have an important role in providing stability to the neck. People with a history of neck or upper back injury, such as whiplash, can show great improvement in pain and function if they strengthen these muscles. Those with postural neck pain often have weakness in these muscles and overuse in the muscles on the top of the shoulders. They too can show a great response to retraining the deep neck flexor muscle group.
</p><br>

<h3>How do I exercise them?</h3>
<h5>Exercise 1</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_2.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Lie on your back with knees comfortably bent. Find your neutral spine position, as explained by your physiotherapist. Use a small rolled towel under the head if needed.</li>
<li>Lift your head off the towel and feel the muscles on the front of the neck. These are NOT the deep neck flexor muscles - these muscles often overwork to try and help with stability, they are not designed for this purpose.</li>
<li>Perform a small nodding movement, as if to look towards your toes. Don't lift your head up. You should not feel the muscles on the front of the neck moving, but rather you should be using the muscles deep behind them.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 2</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_3.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Position as above.</li>
<li>Place your hand on the side of your head and provide gentle resistance, as if you are bending your head to one side.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
<li>Use hand to resist small rotation movement.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 3</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_4.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Lie on your tummy with hands supporting the forehead.</li>
<li>Perform the small nodding movement and float the head and breastbone off the floor.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 4a:</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_5.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Stand with your back to the wall and your feet slightly in front, hip width apart. Perform the small nodding movement, while sliding the base of the skull up the wall. You should feel the neck lengthen.</li>
<li>Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Exercise 4b:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Same as exercise above.</li>
<li>From the lengthened position, move your head away from the wall so that you're looking at the floor.</li>
<li>Then return to the starting position.</li>
<li>Do not allow your chin to poke forward through either movement.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Exercise 4c:</h5>
<p>
<img src="https://www.sprintphysio.co.uk/images/patient-exercises/deep_neck_8.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Sitting in a chair, look up at the ceiling.</li>
<li>When returning the head back to the neutral position, do not let the chin poke forward.</li>
<li>Curl forward one level at a time, starting from the top.</li>
<li>Do not allow your chin to poke forward.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Where do I go from here?</h3>
<p>
Once you have mastered these exercises, you should feel more aware of your neck posture and how to position yourself correctly. You can use this knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>When sitting at your desk/computer or on the couch.</li>
<li>Performing any weights in the gym or doing exercise classes.</li>
</ul>

Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.</p>  <p>Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.</p>  <p>"So we've now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That's the good news," he said. "That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1842141251676-metadata-" title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/643/819/COVID-VARIANT-SCI-BIRAK-080121.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>The B1-17 coronavirus variant, first discovered in the U.K., is now in at least 40 countries, including Canada.

They have said they expect them to be effective, but the timing of those studies is not known.</p>  <p>A senior British lawmaker expressed concerns in an interview on Friday that COVID-19 vaccines might not work properly against the South African variant. He was not responding to questions about Friday's data.</p>  <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc., which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5866498.1610132224!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/virus-outbreak-new-variants.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Graphic shows a diagram of the COVID-19 virus.<!-- --> <!-- -->(AP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Some other vaccines to protect against COVID-19 also use the spike protein to show our immune system what the enemy looks like.</p>  <p>Canadian microbiologist Benjamin tenOever, a professor at the&nbsp;Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York,&nbsp;said our immune system learns to recognize and attack the viral attachment protein at many different sites.</p>  <p>"It would require many many mutations to render our vaccines non-effective,"&nbsp;tenOever&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>The variant is also not the first of the pandemic to emerge and Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said these types of studies&nbsp;will be needed as they appear.</p>  <p>"It may be necessary to tweak the vaccine over time," she said.</p>  <p>Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Friday that 14 cases of the variant first reported in the U.K. have been reported in Canada.</p>  <p>Researchers in Ontario have developed a faster test to identify variants.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>In my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">previous post</a>, I discussed how I’ve decided to learn F# in 2021 for a number of reasons. Around the same time, I also happened to setup my Sim Racing rig so that I could continue to play <a href="https://www.iracing.com/" target="_blank">iRacing</a> with my VR headset (HTC Vive). Its been several years since I’ve last played, but with COVID-related curfews being implemented here in Montreal tomorrow, I’ve been increasingly taking up home-based pursuits which I didn’t always have the time for pre-lockdown. Since the last time I played iRacing, I’m running a PC with a much better processor, motherboard, and only SSDs. The VR performance has been a huge leap forward since I used to play with my old machine and I was quite impressed. After spending a couple of hours setting up, here’s what my current humble racing setup looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/racing-rig.jpg" width="650" height="488" alt="Photo of my current iRacing VR setup"></p>

<p>Having a dedicated table really helps, as in my old apartment it was fairly difficult to setup a station with limited space, but now I can fortunately just jump in. Despite the past limitations, I was able to get fairly competitive and still remember the thrill of my first win agaisnt a field of real racers in a Mazda MX-5:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/irsdk-fsharp/iracing-win.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="Photo of my iRacing first win certificate"></p>

<p>Inspired by setting everything up and doing some laps to practice for an eventual return to comeptition, I started thinking about how I once experimented with using the <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk" target="_blank">Python implementation</a> of the iRacing SDK to connect to an arduino and display a speedometer readout in realtime on a small screen. In reminiscing about the experience, I thought about how I could look into writing an F# implementation of the SDK as a learning project. In addition to learning through the project, it also has the benefit of being of use in a future project involving an iRacing stats tracker web app that I’ve been thinking about writing as a project for my upcoming <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/">cloud computing courses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>I tend to learn best when projects are slightly outside of my comfort zone, and this would be both my first time writing a library, as well as writing one in a functional language! Having used an array of libraries at this point, I had some confidence in choosing an organizational structure, and the Python implementation is only <a href="https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk/blob/master/irsdk.py" target="_blank">739 lines of code</a> which felt doable compared to some of the larger libraries out there.</p>

<p>Moreover, the python implementation of the SDK has the ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get session data (WeekendInfo, SessionInfo, etc…)</li>
  <li>Get live telemetry data (Speed, FuelLevel, etc…)</li>
  <li>Broadcast messages (camera, replay, chat, pit and telemetry commands)</li>
</ul>

<p>and I figured that this would be a good featureset to aim for in the final version of the F# SDK. Out of these features, the session data and live telemetry data would be the ones I plan to implement first.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-library">Creating the Library</h2>

<p>After coming up with some desired features, the first step was to create a new FSharp solution called iRacingFSharp. Inside the solution, I created two projects. One was our actual library, called iRacingFSharp, and the other was a basic console app called SDKReader (located in the Examples Folder) to test the functionality of the library as I worked on it. Note, if you’d like to see the full codebase you can <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-function">The First Function</h2>

<p>Starting small, I decided that a good first function would be to find out the state of the simulator. Fortunately, the iRacing SDK allows you to check if the sim is running using the following URL which points to a localhost server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Getting this URL in Postman returns a JSON object which looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>var simStatus={
   running:0 // 1 if the sim is running
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I decided to make use of the <a href="https://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/Http.html" target="_blank">F# Data HTTP library</a> in order to download the response and so I installed it from NuGet at this point.</p>

<p>Next, inside my iRacingFSharp project I created a file called Irsdk.fs and wrote the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span>

<span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>///&lt;summary&gt;F# implementation of the iRacing SDK.&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>module</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>///&lt;summary&gt;Returns the simStatus in string format&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusURL</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://127.0.0.1:32034/get_sim_status?object=simStatus"</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>simStatusObject</span> <span>=</span> <span>Http</span><span>.</span><span>RequestString</span><span>(</span><span>simStatusURL</span><span>)</span>
        <span>simStatusObject</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, I’ve created a module which contains a function called SimStatus that takes no parameters. It then binds the JSON response to simStatusURL and passes it to the HTTP library via Http.RequestString(). Finally, simStatusObject is returned in string format which can be parsed further by another function in a later step.</p>



<p>With this simple function in place, the next step was to create SDKReader.fs inside my SDKReader console app. This file contained code to call the SimStatus() function and print the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>IrsdkFS</span><span>.</span><span>SimStatus</span><span>()</span>
    <span>printf</span> <span>"%s"</span> <span>test</span>
    <span>0</span> <span>// return an integer exit code</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running dotnet build inside the SDKReader folder displayed the following output while iRacing was running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"var simStatus={
   running:1
};
"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Success! With this method working, we now have the very beginnings of an F# implementation of the iRacing SDK! Although it is a small step, we were also able to create and structure the project. Lastly, I also setup a a basic .NET build through Github Actions for CI.</p>



<p>iRacing’s API telemetry comes in three variations; data written to a .ibt file 60 times a second, live data exposed to the telemetry API 60 times per second, and a session string in YAML format that contains more or less static information about the session. The YAML string is appended to the end of the .ibt file but only a small portion of that data is exposed. This means that going forward, I’ll need to look into parsing the YAML as well as mapping more of the API endpoints. The iRacing API appears to be nonstandard and so it may take a little more work than just a typical REST API.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Part Two where I plan to implement some telemetry functions and look into parsing the aforementioned YAML. In addition, be sure to follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/irsdk-fsharp" target="_blank">Github Repo here</a> if you’re interested in seeing how to project progresses (or would like to contribute)!</p>

        <h2>Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive</h2>
      </p>
      
        
      

      <div><p>Donald Trump loves to tweet and everyone knows that.
Twitter is his favorite medium to express his ideas and to communicate with the world.
He has been an active Twitter user since 2009. Much longer than many other world leaders.</p>
<p>Last month (May 2020) he tweeted 845 times â€” that's 28 tweets per day on average!</p>
<center>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/491324429184823296"><img src="https://pikaso.me/blog/files/pikaso.me-realDonaldTrump-20140721_205046-491324429184823296.png" alt="Trump Tweet" width="500" height="244"></a>
</center>
<p>A while ago we received a request from one of our users who was looking for a way to screenshot all Donald Trump tweets.
We realized that's a good opportunity to put <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a> into test and see if it can perform such a task without any problems.
It went smoothly and there was only an issue with one of his tweets which included a deleted image.</p>
<p>Today, we are releasing the resulting files to the public.
This archive contains screenshots of 43,475 Donald Trump tweets from May 2009 to May 2020.
Whether you are pro- or anti- Trump, this is an important part of Internet history that we believe should be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>The Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive can be downloaded through the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.zip">trump_twitter_archive_v1.zip</a> (Direct download, 2.6 GB)</li>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.torrent">trump_twitter_archive_v1.torrent</a> (Torrent download, 28.2 KB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="howthiswasmade">How This Was Made?</h3>
<p>To create this archive, we first extracted all tweet ids from the realDonaldTrump.csv file that was provided to us.
That file only contained Donald Trump tweets up to March 29, 2020. To get the later tweets, we used <a href="http://trumptwitterarchive.com/">trumptwitterarchive.com</a>.</p>
<p>We then used the <a href="https://pikaso.me/api">Pikaso API</a> to screenshot each individual tweet.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>We have no plans to keep this archive up to date after the initial release.
However, if you are interested in doing so, you can use <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a>.
You can even <a href="https://pikaso.me/automate">automate</a> it so that each time he tweets, an automatic screenshot is taken.</p>
