<p>Do surgeries work? Most of us assume they do, but is there any scientific evidence that they do?</p>

<p>In this episode, I talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/drianharris">Dr Ian Harris</a> who is a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Australia. He is a practicing orthopedic surgeon specializing in trauma surgery. Outside his practice, his research interests broadly cover the topic of surgical effectiveness and clinical research.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Notes and key insights</h3>

<p>1/ <strong>What is a placebo surgery?</strong> It’s where you make an incision but not do anything. </p>

<p>It’s analogous to traditional placebo in medicine, where a sugar or salt pill is given instead of an active chemical to see whether the intended medicine has an actual impact.</p>

<p>2/ <strong>Majority of surgeries that Dr Ian Harris and other researchers have studied in fact are not more effective than placebos</strong>. This is shocking because even when we have no proof that they work, many of these surgeries are happening even today.</p>

<p>3/ <strong>Examples of such ineffective surgeries include back pain surgeries and knee pain surgeries.</strong> For such surgeries, randomized control trials have found that if you make an incision in the knee but don’t do anything, it’s as effective as actually conducting the surgery of the knee.</p>

<p>4/ Why do patients get better if the surgery doesn’t work? It’s because<strong> many diseases or pain have a natural progression</strong>, and we generally seek surgical/medicinal intervention when we’re in the worst condition. If the body heals / condition becomes better after that, we attribute improvement to the intervention rather than thinking it could have happened anyway (due to the natural course of the condition).</p>

<p>5/ As Dr Ian Harris said, the unsaid attitude could be stated like: “<strong>you have to operate on patients quickly before they get better</strong>“.</p>

<p>Remember: in many cases, if you get sick, you get better after that. And that is why placebos seem to work.</p>

<p>6/ It’s shocking to hear that randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many surgical interventions end up finding that they’re ineffective.</p>

<p>But what’s most shocking is that <strong>many other interventions have never been subjected to an RCT against a placebo</strong>. For many of the common procedures traditionally practiced, we don’t know whether they work at all or not.</p>

<p>7/ For sure, there are many studies that study variations of surgical methods. That is, they try to find out whether an incision from the left is better or from the right. </p>

<p>But very few studies try to find out whether the incision does anything at all for the patient. Shocking, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>8/ In that sense, <strong>surgery is different than medicine</strong>. All new pharmaceutical molecules are subjected to rigorous clinical trials where they’re tested against placebo or doing nothing. In many countries, there’s no such procedure for surgical treatments. If there is a procedure for new surgical procedures, nobody is testing old ones that have been getting performed every day without evidence.</p>

<p>8/ If research indicates many of the currently practiced surgeries don’t work, why are they still practiced?</p>

<p>Well, <strong>if your salary depends on not believing something, you won’t believe it.</strong></p>

<p>9/ And such <strong>denial is not new</strong>. The most common surgical procedure in history was bloodletting. This practice which lasted for thousands of years was only questioned in mid 19th century, and even after randomized trials showed that it hurt the patient, it wasn’t abandoned suddenly. It died a slow death as its practitioners started dying. </p>

<p>10/ Even today, the fact that practices like Homeopathy survive suggests that <strong>seeking evidence of what works isn’t a big priority for society</strong>. Perhaps keeping traditions is a bigger priority.</p>

<p>11/ But because it’s costly and risky to perform surgeries, the urgent question is: <strong>what surgical procedures are today’s equivalent of bloodletting</strong>? And those that we know are bloodletting, how do we get rid of them as a society?</p>

<p>12/ As a patient, what should you do? Dr Ian Harris recommends that every time your doctor recommends a medical procedure, <strong>ALWAYS ask for risks and benefits</strong>. </p>

<p>Risks are a given and doctors generally are happy to talk about them. But nobody asks for benefits because they’re assumed to be there. </p>

<p>Ask and confirm about benefits explicitly.</p>

<p>13/ What if the pain isn’t going away at all? Should you then get surgery?</p>

<p>Golden advice by Dr Ian -&gt;  “<strong>the severity of your symptoms does not change the effectiveness of the operation</strong>“</p>

January 20, 2021 | https://jakobgreenfeld.com/metrics | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jakobgreenfeld.com/metrics">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Let’s say my goal this year is to get to 10k monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>

<p>MRR first, everything else second. I would ruthlessly cut out all activities that don’t lead to a measurable MRR increase. For example, I would stop writing blog posts like the one you’re currently reading. I certainly wouldn’t create fun projects like What to Tweet or take the time for non-transactional Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I would focus on my revenue generating projects, crank up the advertising machinery and do everything I can think of that potentially increases my MRR.
I’m fairly confident that I would reach 10k MRR by the end of the year. But at what price?</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back for a second.</p>

<p>You know who manages by metrics? Big companies like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>And what do they have in common?</p>

<p>Their core product got notably worse over time.</p>

<p>Google’s search results are dominated by ads and many users now use workarounds to find what they’re looking for (“Best headphone reddit”). LinkedIn looks like Minesweeper. Facebook was a fun place to meet friends. And if you search for an electronics product on Amazon, you immediately feel like you’re at a flea market in the middle of Shenzhen.
This is the result of hundreds of decisions that were motivated by a short-term focus on specific metrics like revenue and click rates. And while these decisions most likely optimized the metrics, they made the user experience worse.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t have the technology to measure the right thing. Or maybe the “right thing” is inherently immeasurable.</p>

<p>Or, and that’s my personal favorite, we’re dealing with a Schrödinger’s cat like situation. The “right thing” is only the right thing as long as we’re not trying to optimize it.
This is known as Goodhart’s law. “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.“</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example.</p>

<p>Who else manages by metrics? Politicians!</p>

<p>Instead of some boring historic example (there are plenty, just read “Seeing like a State”), I’m going to spice things up by talking about something that’s happening right now.
It’s not hard to anticipate what I want to talk about since there’s precisely one thing that’s currently happening: Covid-19.</p>

<p>Politicians try to manage the situation by focusing on metrics like the “R number”. At least here in Germany the motto is: let’s lower the R number at all costs.
Turns out the cost of this strategy is incredibly high. It’s just not immediately measurable.</p>

<p>For example, everyone’s getting fatter since all gyms and sport clubs are closed. Most people are developing unhealthy eating habits because there’s simply nothing else to do. Social connections are rapidly degregating even though everyone knows how important they’re for the human wellbeing.</p>

<p>I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet, but I can easily imagine that there are lots of further unintended consequences of the current lockdown policy. For example, since most people now spend most of their time indoors alone and wear masks when they leave their homes, their immune system isn’t stressed regularly like it usual is. Hence I wouldn’t be surprised if many people will get sick of other diseases once the lockdown ends as a result of weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I’m all for taking Covid seriously. In fact, I’ve been hoarding masks since 2009. I spent the summer of 2009 with a bunch of friends in Lloret de Mar (a party hotspot in Spain) just when news of the swine flu started to emerge. Long story short, everyone in our group got sick (20+ people) except for my girlfriend and me because we’ve been wearing masks.
Now the most famous example how focusing on metrics can have unhealthy consequences is the cobra effect. I’ll just quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The term cobra effect originated in an anecdote that describes an occurrence during India under British rule. The British government was concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi. The government therefore offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one more example I always have to talk about when the topic comes up: academia.</p>

<p>Stagnation apologists love to argue that the lack of progress in science is simply a result of the fact that all low-hanging fruit are gone.</p>

<p>That’s complete nonsense. There’s still plenty of low-hanging fruit. It’s just that everyone is so busy chasing meaningless metrics that they can’t see them.</p>

<p>In academia the metric of choice usually has something to do with the number of citations. But just like Google’s backlink-driven algorithm (which was in fact inspired by academia’s citation metrics) was quickly gamed by savvy webmasters, academia’s algorithm is gamed by careerists.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about some tiny minority here. If you want to survive in academia, you have to play the citation game. And if everyone is cheating, at the very least you have to do the same to stand a chance.</p>

<p>You have to partner up with others because five people can write five times as many papers. You agree to constantly cite each other. Likewise, you focus on incremental additions to established ideas because that’s the safest way to new publications regularly. You work on the stuff everyone else is working on because how else are you going to get citations?</p>

<p>And one thing you absolutely have to avoid like the plague is the risky and deep kind of research that leads to real progress in the field.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t that citations are a bad metric, and we need to come up with smarter ones. Instead, it’s just Goodhart’s law in action.
Every attempt to manage academia makes it worse.</p>

<p>As soon a new metric is introduced it will misdirect the attention of scientists towards playing the game, instead of progressing science.</p>

<p>I talked about three areas, but the same pattern occurs almost everywhere. For example, just remember when everyone started minimizing fat in their diet or how grades are used to measure “learning”.</p>

<p>Crucially the problem is not the specific metric that’s being used. Whatever new metric gets introduced will soon again be made useless by Goodhart’s law. The metrics game will always be akin to Whac-A-Mole.</p>

<p>Now where does this leave us? If management by metrics doesn’t work, what else should we do?</p>

<p>First of all, I think that looking at metrics can be helpful. They just shouldn’t be the sole yardstick decisions are measured against.</p>

<p>And while the map never will be the territory, the picture you’re looking at gets more accurate the more metrics you consider. For example, if politicians would not just consider the R number but hundreds of metrics that take different aspects of a population’s wellbeing into account, the decisions would be better ones.</p>

<p>The obvious problem is that decisions become much harder if you consider more than one metric.</p>

<p>But more importantly there are so many factors we can’t measure that nevertheless should be taken into account.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I become convinced that it all boils down to talking to people.</p>

<p>And I’m not talking about surveys that distill thousands of standardized “conversations” into a few numbers or analytics tools that do similar things for behavior. I’m talking about real one-on-one interactions.</p>

<p>Just imagine if Jeff Bezos would talk to hundreds of real (non pre-vetted) Amazon customers each month and take what he hears in these conversations seriously. Or if politicians would have long conversations with regular people from all wakes of life. Or if academic committees would actually talk to applicants before filtering them out based on citation metrics.</p>

<p>In our hyper rational world it’s extremely hard to justify decisions based on the mere gut feeling you got from a few conversations. But this is exactly what people should be doing.</p>

<p>Engagement metrics will never tell you if users are genuinely happy when they use your product. But a few genuine conversations will.</p>

<p>A resume will never tell you if a person is genuinely interested in uncovering unknown truths about nature. But a 30-minute conversation will.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s so much easier to reach a consensus if you just hire the candidate with the highest citation metrics or implement the feature that will lead to the largest revenue increase in the next quarter. But while it’s the easiest decision it’s usually not the best one.</p>

<p>And I think the same applies not just to managing organizations but also to managing ourselves.</p>

<p>Just by listening to my own body I’ll always know better than any fitness tracker if I slept well, better than any blood test if my diet is healthy, and better than my bank account if I’m happy.
That doesn’t mean that I’ll not use a fitness tracker, make regular blood tests, or check my bank account. But I certainly won’t allow them to dictate my decisions.</p>

<p>I’ll look at all the facts and take everything in, even the stuff that can’t be measured, and then I’ll just go with my gut.</p>

<p>Today is the day I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">Sturgeon’s law</a>:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Ninety percent of everything is crap.</p><cite>Sturgeon’s law</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I like this for a lot of reasons. But most of all, I like it as a nudge to try harder to enjoy things. </p>



<p>Think you hate poetry? Roller coasters? Banjo music? Thai food? Maybe you haven’t discovered the good 10% yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>How about work? Think QA engineers are <a href="https://critter.blog/2021/01/04/dont-flip-the-bozo-bit/">useless</a>? Code review is a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">waste of time</a>? <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">Managers</a> hurt more than they help? Maybe you’ve been stuck with the crap 90% of them. Keep looking.</p>



<p>Then there’s relationships. Think there’s no one out there who can make you <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">happy</a>? Maybe you haven’t climbed out of your 90% of crappy relationships yet. Keep looking.</p>



<p>It reminds me of a <a href="https://ideopunk.com/2020/12/22/100-tips-for-a-better-life/">quote I read </a>recently:</p>



<blockquote><p>Keep your identity small. “I’m not the kind of person who does things like that” is not an explanation, it’s a trap. It prevents nerds from working out and men from dancing.&nbsp;</p><cite>Conor Barnes</cite></blockquote>



<p>Remember: <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/16/strong-opinions-loosely-held-sure-but-why/">strong opinions, loosely held</a>. If you think you hate something, hold that opinion loosely by putting it to the test. Try to prove it false. </p>



<p>Don’t be so quick to accept that something is not for you. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">Keep looking</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[The harmful assumptions we make about tasks]]>

January 20, 2021 | https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/post/task-management-assumptions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Most task managers make two assumptions. Do you make them too?</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A task manager needs to remember all of your tasks</em> <br>(Would you buy a task manager that lost data?)</li>
<li><em>All tasks can use a similar creation workflow</em> <br>(You hit the ‘create issue’ button, and fill in some fields. Simple, obvious, how could it be better?)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not obvious that they’re wrong—they actually seem <em>useful</em>. But both at work, and at home, making these assumptions will reduce your effectiveness.</p>
<p>And if you have trouble context-switching, procrastinate tasks, or have an ever-growing task backlog that looms over your head, these assumptions have likely caused you unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they hurt us, and how to stop it from happening.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-tasks-cause-fatigue">Permanent tasks cause fatigue</h2>
<p>Before starting Tandem, my manager Tim previously co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/01/yahoo-acquires-to-do-app-astrid/">Astrid</a>, a personal task manager, which he later sold to Yahoo.</p>
<p>At Astrid, Tim tried an interesting re-engagement email. Users who had been inactive for 6 weeks were asked: “want to delete all your tasks and start fresh?”</p>
<p>The hypothesis was that these inactive users had tasks that overwhelmed them. Either the amount, the complexity, or the low importance of backlogged tasks, caused users to put tasks off. So every time these users visited Astrid, they saw tasks they couldn’t do, felt bad, and eventually stopped visiting—procrastination in action. Astrid’s re-engagement email offered the users a chance to start fresh.</p>
<p>It was impressively compelling. Most re-engagement emails get a 1% response rate. This email had about 5%.</p>
<p>I imagine those users had the same feeling you get when you move from one browser to another, or from one task manager to another, and leave your bookmarks, open tabs, backlogged tasks, to start fresh in the name of increased productivity.</p>
<p>But simply deleting the backlog doesn’t end the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nowadays, Tim uses a simpler task manager—a notebook. He uses a page a day, adds some tasks from JIRA, and when tasks come in during the day, he writes them down and works on them when he’s available. These are mostly small tasks, things that are easy to forget. If he gets a bug (important to track) or a task he can delegate, he puts it in JIRA.</p>
<p>The notebook isn’t meant to store issues forever. The pages get turned, and previous information becomes less accessible. So the next day, if he needs to carry over something that hasn’t been completed, he needs to make the conscious decision to do so.</p>
<p>This solution solves task-management fatigue. And incidentally, it solves another problem:</p>
<h2 id="not-all-tasks-are-created-the-same">Not all tasks are created the same</h2>
<p>There is a gap in task management. When we look at the tools used for tracking tasks and goals, there’s something for every level of the company:</p>
<br>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Tool</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Company quarter-level</td>
<td>Quarterly Goals</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Org quarter-level</td>
<td>KPIs</td>
<td>Notion/Gdocs, JIRA Epics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team sprint-level</td>
<td>Tickets</td>
<td>JIRA Tasks/Bugs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal day-level</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>???</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Except at the personal day-level, where you’re working on tickets, getting requests for feature updates from your PM, bug discoveries from QA, and breaking down your actual tickets into different tasks, which may require subtasks that weren’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One proposal is that you should track all of these tasks, no matter how small, in JIRA. But the teams I see successful at implementing this are those that can afford to work at a slower, more “enterprise” pace. Which isn’t a problem—at least for engineering—but it’s often not an option at smaller startups, when learning cycles must be fast.</p>
<p><em>Even if you work at a larger company, at a slower pace, you may relate when it comes to personal life: tasks come from a variety of directions, at all times. You can’t toss every minor task in a task manager.</em></p>
<p>You can’t fix every task before the next one comes in. If you only use JIRA, you choose between possibly forgetting these small tasks, or breaking your train of thought to search, categorize, and fill out a form every time you get a small task.</p>
<p>On the flip side, quickly writing these down in a temporary place means that <strong>you don’t need to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend mental effort remembering minor tasks,</li>
<li>or take significant time to file minor issues.</li>
<li>Have your task manager filled with minor issues you’ve forgotten to close,</li>
<li>or leave hastily-written issues for later, when you forget what the vaguely titled issue is for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="correcting-for-the-mistakes">Correcting for the mistakes</h2>
<p>The solution is not complicated: use a temporary, personal task manager.</p>
<p>Don’t go out and buy something new. You already have something you can use at home. Tim’s notebook is a good example. I personally message myself on Slack (and iMessage, for personal use).</p>
<details zgotmplz="">
<summary>An example of how I Slack myself</summary>
<div>
<h4 id="using-slack-for-daily-personal-tasks">Using Slack for daily personal tasks</h4>
<p>When I’m working, and get a non-urgent task that would otherwise interrupt me, it goes in my Slack DMs. This is what it looks like:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7647.jpg">
</p>
<p>Some days are quiet</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/IMG_7644.jpg">
</p>
<p>And some are hectic</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the morning, to re-build yesterday’s context, I just look at yesterday’s list. If there are unfinished items, I can carry them over. But it’s a conscious decision. I don’t need to carry over optional, low-priority tasks.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got a bad memory, there’s a huge benefit for team stand-ups. I used to write JQL filters to search JIRA (doesn’t work—and misses tasks), now I just take a look at Slack.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>The important requirements are just that your task manager:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requires effort to carry over old tasks.</li>
<li>Makes writing down tasks quick.</li>
<li>Isn’t used for notes <em>(anecdotally, this adds noise, and forces you to parse notes from tasks)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a task is critical, long term, or requires cooperation, file it in your normal issue tracker. Otherwise, it’s probably a daily, personal task, and you can file it in here.</p>
<p>So take out a notebook, open Slack, pick what works for you. And see if you don’t feel calmer and more in control of your tasks.</p>

<p>I think these tools have interesting ideas to help individuals manage tasks.</p>
<h3 id="amna">Amna</h3>
<p>Ravi, my old college roommate and friend since high school, left Microsoft to build <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">Amna</a>, a personal task manager with tight browser integration.</p>
<p>I resonate with the thesis: recently I switched away from Firefox Tree Style Tabs, because I noticed that by organizing my tabs (which were part of tasks), it inadvertently became a de-facto task manager. But it wasn’t built for that!</p>
<p>Amna solves that exact problem: each task you do spawns a browser that keeps all of your relevant tabs.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna1.jpg">
</p>
<p>All the tabs in this browser window are related to the same task, and Amna keeps their state when I close the browser.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/amna2.jpg">
</p>
<p>After I'm done with a task, I can go back and look at the tabs I had open.</p>
</div>
<p>It helps prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muscle-memory opening HN, clicking an interesting blog post, and leaving it open “to read later” for several weeks</li>
<li>The pain of trawling through bookmarks and browser history, when you realize you forgot something</li>
<li>The clutter of leaving tabs open to prevent forgetting something</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve forgotten a time when you had less than five tabs open, <a href="https://www.getamna.com/">try using Amna</a>.</p>
<h3 id="jam">Jam</h3>
<p>Two of my ex-Cloudflare friends, Dani and Irtefa, started <a href="https://jam.dev/">Jam</a>. It’s probably the fastest way for PMs/designers to directly make comments on a website. So you get less minor interruptions, and more clarity on the requested change.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.cyrusroshan.com/img/task-management-assumptions/jam2.jpg">
</p>
<p>All you do is type `jam` on the page, click an element, and type the comment</p>
</div>
<p>But I don’t include Jam here just for that. Jam also allows you to <a href="https://words.jam.dev/introducing-jam-wand/">offload the actual copy changes</a> to your PM, which flat-out decreases your minor tasks. If this sounds exciting, get on the waitlist <a href="https://jam.dev/">here</a>.</p>

        <section>
            <article>
                <p>In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm, discovered/invented by <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/index.html">J. Paul Rodker Morrison</a> in the late '60s, that uses a "data processing factory" metaphor for designing and building applications.  FBP defines applications as networks of "black box" processes, which communicate via data chunks (called Information Packets) travelling across predefined connections (think "conveyor belts"), where the connections are specified externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.</p>
                <p>FBP is a special case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow">dataflow</a> programming characterized by asynchronous, concurrent processes "under the covers", Information Packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, "bounded buffer" connections, and definition of connections external to the components - it has been found to support improved development time and maintainability, reusability, rapid prototyping, simulation, improved performance, and good communication among developers,  maintenance staff, users, systems people, and management - not to mention that FBP naturally takes advantage of multiple cores... without the programmer having to struggle with the intricacies of multitasking!</p>
               <p>FBP exhibits "data coupling", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture.</p>
					<p>FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi-party protocols.</p>
                <p><img src="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/bottling_factory.png" alt="Bottling factory" height="400"> </p>
                
                <p>
                    FBP involves a significant "paradigm shift" from conventional programming, as it uses an "assembly line" image of data processing, which really has to be used to experience its advantages.  Not surprisingly given the hold that the so-called "von Neumann" paradigm has over programming technology, over the last 40+ years a number of companies have come out with FBP-like or "FBP-inspired" systems (to borrow a term coined by Joe Witt of Cloudera), which do not involve this paradigm shift, including some of the biggest and most successful companies in the industry, such as IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the New York Times (see <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/links_external.html">FBP External References</a>).  Unfortunately, without the FBP paradigm shift, these systems cannot fully achieve the advantages listed above, although most of them combine a visual notation with some degree of componentry.  We have therefore been forced to use the term "classical FBP" to refer to the FBP architecture described in this web site.  It is hard for someone reading documentation to tell whether a given product calling itself "FBP- like" is "classical" or not,  but, roughly, multiple input ports, "back pressure", and asynchronism, constitute a sort of litmus test to check whether systems should be classed as "classical" FBP systems. While the FBP paradigm shift may cause some trouble at first, given the prevalence of the older programming approaches, in fact it embodies a simple mental model (not "simple" as in easy but "simple" as in elegant, to quote Joe Witt), and has proven over several decades to result in applications that are more understandable and maintainable than those built using the conventional (von Neumann) paradigm.
                </p>
	    <p>If you <i>have</i> come across Flow-Based Programming by way of NoFlo, Flowhub, Node-RED, or similar packages, it is recommended that you read <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/fbp-inspired-vs-real-fbp.html"><i>FBP vs. FBP-inspired Systems</i></a>, which attempts to highlight the differences and similarities between FBP proper, or "classical" FBP, (the subject of this web site) on the one hand, and NoFlo and other similar "FBP-inspired" systems on the other. </p>
                <p>FBP is described in J. Paul Morrison's book, <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/book.html">Flow-Based Programming: A New Approach to Application Development"</a>, now in its 2nd edition, which can be obtained in paperback form from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-2nd-Application-Development/dp/1451542321">Amazon</a>, or in 2 e-book formats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-Based-Programming-J-Paul-Morrison-ebook/dp/B004PLO66O">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/j-paul-morrison/flow-based-programming-2nd-edition/ebook/product-21172063.html">epub</a>.</p>
                <p>Further down on this web page you will find a bunch of useful links, including some videos demonstrating the use of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp/blob/master/README.md">DrawFBP</a>.  During FBP's early days, networks were coded by hand, and initially we used pencil and paper, followed by more sophisticated graphical tools, whether or not they played well with FBP software.  However, with the advent of good graphical support, we now have a powerful graphical tool (<a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp">DrawFBP</a>), and in recent years the emphasis has been shifting to doing the diagramming on-line, and then generating the network code (we can see this progression with other flow tools on the market).  Now that compile and run functions (for Java and C#) have been added to DrawFBP, the developer can do much of the development graphically, and on-line.
                </p>    
                <p>We are in the process of "growing" a <a href="https://github.com/jpaulm/fbp-tutorial-filter-file">tutorial</a> which will introduce the reader to the basic concepts of FBP by means of a series of "steps", which use the diagramming tool DrawFBP to progressively expand an application diagram and generate and run code at many of those steps.  </p>            
            <p>There is a Google group on FBP, with almost 800 members, and a Slack channel has recently been set up - here is the invitation link, if you are interested in joining: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/fbphq/shared_invite/enQtOTM4ODkzMTYyODE3LTJiMmNlZjhiMWY1MDY1ODA4Y2YzNDBlNDZlMTBkMDNlMjcwNzg2MGZhZjA2NjJjYTliYTM0OTIyYmM0Yzk0MDQ">Slack invitation</a>.</p>

                <!--<p>We know you are tired of Powerpoint presentations, but <a href="https://jpaulm.github.io/fbp/FBPnew.ppt">this one</a> (from 2007) gives quite a good overview of FBP - as it was at that time.  There is also a <a href="http://player.vimeo.com/video/79329015">video</a> (not very professional, I'm afraid!), where I present this at a Meetup in Toronto in Sept. 2013 organized by Paul Tarvydas, CEO of Tarvydas-Sanford Controls Inc., and Dann Toliver. It has a few jokes and reminiscences, and may be more accessible than the straight Powerpoint presentation!   The Paul referred to in the video is Paul Tarvydas. Towards the end (at 40:12) there is a brief demo of the FBP diagramming tool, <a href="..\graphicsstuff\index.shtml">DrawFBP</a>.</p>-->

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>You’re a software engineering leader, and you’re great at your job. You know that the optimal path for software development lies in figuring out which components of your design to implement from scratch and which have already been implemented by specialists and can be reused.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>You also know that these aren’t decisions that you can only make once – you have to keep reevaluating based on environment changes and the needs of new products.</p>

<p>Authentication is one of those components that you deal with all the time. Auth is a necessary part of any software product, but how you implement auth is not necessarily always the same. Careful consideration is needed, because your decision to outsource will not only impact speed of development, but also long-term product maintenance – you don’t want to slow down time to market because you re-implemented an entire auth system unnecessarily, but you also don’t want to use an auth system that is going to cause problems down the road.</p>

<p>So what are the primary considerations when making your decision?</p>

<h2 id="speed-to-market">Speed to market</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious consideration. Depending on the features you need, it could literally take months to implement auth in-house, whereas it could take less than a day to incorporate an outsourced solution.</p>

<p>You could say “but what if we only need a bare-bones implementation? Some salted hashes in a database and we’re good to go!” That’s a totally valid point, and if you don’t anticipate needing sophisticated auth features then your best bet might be to do a quick in-house implementation and move on.</p>

<p>However, time and time again I’ve seen product developers underestimate the sophistication of features that will be required when their userbases grow. Most of the time development organizations then fall prey to the sunk costs fallacy and double down on augmenting their in-house solution, even when it may be more efficient to abandon the home-grown effort and replace it with an outsourced solution. This will cause huge issues for maintainability, which I’ll talk about further below.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-breach">Consequences of an auth breach</h2>

<p>Planning for the worst possible case can prevent total financial ruin for your company or division. If a breach of security happens and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is leaked from your in-house auth system, it can not only cause your company reputational damage but also significant financial penalties (not to mention potential jail time if you try to cover up the breach).</p>

<p>If you outsource your auth system you can limit your liability, and also protect your reputation – if there is a breach on your auth provider’s side, it’s likely that the breach will extend beyond your company. A breach in an outsourced auth provider that is used by many different companies will be big news, and customers will be more likely to forgive you for making a mistake in your choice of auth provider than for implementing a poor auth system yourself.</p>

<p>A not-insignificant addendum is that I believe your in-house system is much more likely to suffer a breach than an outsourced provider who is an expert in security. I have no studies to support this claim, but I have never seen a major auth provider compromised, and I’ve definitely seen companies suffer breaches due to their own in-house auth implementations – <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/hacked-and-dumped-online-773-million-records-with-plaintext-passwords/">this article discusses a compilation of 21 million plaintext passwords collected from various breaches</a> wherein passwords were not hashed and salted by auth systems.</p>

<p>Properly storing passwords is an incredibly low bar, and yet companies that manage their own auth still do it incorrectly all the time.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-an-auth-outage">Consequences of an auth outage</h2>

<p>While less damaging than breaches, outages can still cause reputational damage and liability issues if your SLAs make uptime guarantees. Similarly to breaches, if you outsource your auth system it’s likely that any auth outage will extend beyond your company.</p>

<p>As an example, when Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory (AAD) <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-azure-ad-authentication-outage-what-went-wrong/">went down for a good portion of the afternoon late last year</a>, logins for applications across the internet stopped working.</p>

<p>When your competitors’ authorization systems are down at the same time yours are, nobody blames you for it, but when you’re the only company having issues, you suffer reputationally. No matter what your outsourced auth system is (FusionAuth, Cognito, AAD, etc), you can be almost certain that you won’t be alone in the event of an outage.</p>

<h2 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h2>

<p>There are trade-offs here. The benefits to an in-house system include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your engineers can design the exact system to fit your needs, and you’ll have unrestricted ability to add very specific features if requirements change over time.</li>
  <li>If the same engineers who built the system are maintaining it, then they’ll have the context required to anticipate issues as they add features.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the drawbacks can be large:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex new features can take significant time to build. Outsourced auth systems likely have these features already built (things like multi-factor authentication, user management interfaces, analytics and audit logs, and brute force hack detection, among others).</li>
  <li>With an in-house solution, you’ll have to budget time to monitor new security threats and patch your system in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</li>
  <li>You won’t get the benefits of a dedicated team that are constantly improving your auth system. This is actually a bigger deal than it seems, because if you outsource auth then other companies will also be filing issue reports and feature requests on your behalf, so you reap the benefits of those extra eyes as well.</li>
  <li>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, an in-house solution is likely to be terrible at combining different databases of users and managing things like duplicates or incomplete data. Such enterprise identity unification efforts can founder on internal auth systems. FusionAuth, on the other hand, supports modeling different user bases with tenants.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-in-house-vs-outsourced-auth">Cost of in-house vs outsourced auth</h2>

<p>When building an in-house auth system your costs are all ostensibly sunk (engineer salaries). However, if building your system in-house delays time to market or prevents creation of other features, the build could cost you a significant amount of real income. There will also be on-going maintenance costs with an in-house solution.</p>

<p>When making cost calculations, you should compare:</p>

<p><strong>Revenue lost by slower time-to-market PLUS engineering cost to implement in-house solution PLUS on-going maintenance costs of in-house solution PLUS increased risk of data breach PLUS increased risk of outage PLUS increased risk during a merger or acquisition</strong></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><strong>The monthly cost incurred by an outsourced provider PLUS the lack of complete control</strong></p>

<p>When evaluating different auth providers, you’ll also want to consider whether an outsourced provider charges on a sliding scale based on number of users or if the cost is fixed. AWS Cognito, for instance, will continue to charge more as your application gains more users. FusionAuth, in contrast, has options that charge a single rate for unlimited users. If your app is small and you don’t expect it to grow much, a sliding scale may be better for you. If you don’t want a large unexpected bill as you gain more users, a provider that allows for fixed costs may be more appealing.</p>



<p>As a final consideration, you may want to evaluate if your engineers even have the ability to implement a secure in-house auth system without a significant investment in education. This is something that many leaders dismiss, since they have great faith in the intelligence and skill of their people.</p>

<p>However, knowledge and intelligence aren’t the same, and just because your engineers are capable of becoming auth experts doesn’t mean you want them to spend the time to do so.</p>

<p>As an engineering leader, you have a responsibility to ensure that your engineers are spending their time on efforts that will optimally contribute to the long-term success of your organization. Auth is a necessary component, but is it really a differentiator for your application?</p>

<p>Only you have the context to make the best decisions for your company, but I hope this article has helped you think through some of the considerations involved in outsourcing your auth.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    
    <p>I know a number of folks use <strong>The Great Suspender</strong> to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleTaylor/comments/jowlt2/open_source_development_the_great_suspender_saga/">taken over by a shady anonymous entity</a> and is now
<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/great-suspender-extension-now-flagged-malware-edge-has-built-replacement">flagged by Microsoft as malware</a>. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for users of The Great Suspender (7.1.8):</strong></p>

<h3>Temporary easy fix</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable analytics tracking by opening the extension options for
The Great Suspender and checking the box
“Automatic deactivation of any kind of tracking”.</li>
<li>Pray that the shady developer doesn’t issue a malicious update to The Great Suspender later.
(There’s no sensible way to disable updates of an individual extension.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Permanent harder fix <small>(👈 <strong>Recommended!</strong>)</small></h3>

<ul>
<li>Close as many unneeded tabs as you can.</li>
<li>Unsuspend all remaining tabs. ⏳</li>
<li>Uninstall The Great Suspender.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases/tag/v7.1.6">latest good version</a> of The Great Suspender (7.1.6) from GitHub,
and move it to some permanent location outside your Downloads folder.
(It should be commit 9730c09.)</li>
<li>Load your downloaded copy as <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-you-can-still-download-chrome-extensions-without-us-1826796797">an unpacked extension</a>.
(This copy will not auto-update to future untrusted versions of the extension.)</li>
<li>All done! 🎉</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> My understanding is that installing an unpacked extension in this way
will cause Chrome to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25847171">issue a new kind of security prompt</a> every time it is
launched, which you’ll have to ignore. 😕</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>Other browser extensions for suspending tabs exist, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25846504">Hacker New discussion</a> for this article. However I have not conducted my own
security review on any of those other extensions, so buyer beware.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a> was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Criticism">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. I posted a <a href="https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/10/youtube-dl-takedown/">detailed analysis</a> explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/github-reinstates-youtube-dl-after-riaas-abuse-dmca">filed a counter-notice</a> on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</p>
<h2 id="eff-helps-out-by-writing-a-counter-notice">EFF helps out by writing a counter notice</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a non-governmental organization based in the U.S. dedicated to defending civil liberties and especially digital rights, helped out the youtube-dl maintainers by filing a very informative <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">counter notice</a> with GitHub. This notice explained why the request itself is an abuse of the DMCA and the takedown was not justified at all. It allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository and, more importantly, all the metadata (for example, issues and pull requests) that was posted on the platform by users, developers and maintainers. Such information is invaluable to a project, and a takedown of the <em>entire</em> repository with all this data can hurt a project very badly.</p>
<p>The takedown was widely regarded as abuse of the DMCA by the RIAA, given that the youtube-dl code repository did not contain any infringing material. The argumentation was made up by claiming that the primary purpose was to infringe copyright of some songs whose artists are apparently represented by the RIAA. They cited some automated unit tests for this, which do not download the entire songs, and would not be seen or executed by regular users. The EFF argues that these are likely a form of “fair use” and thus allowed legally.</p>
<p>The request also cited an obscure German court decision which considered YouTube’s “rolling cipher” an “effective technological measure”, whose bypassing would be prohibited by copyright laws around the world. The EFF explains that the decision was “wrongly decided and is not binding nor even persuasive under U.S. law”.</p>
<p>The EFF further questions the effectivity of the algorithm in general, given that YouTube delivers the code for decryption in a readable form (and also, the code can be executed outside browsers, too). On top of that, the streams are freely accessible once you have the URLs. YouTube only hides the URLs, but not in an effective way. Therefore, this algorithm cannot be considered a “technological measure”, and thus, the RIAA request is baseless.</p>
<p>In the context of this debate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS">DeCSS controversy</a> was mentioned a lot, as there’s been some similarities with how copyright holders reacted to the existence of software to bypass their (arguably not very secure) CSS protection. Their first actions focused on software hosting sites, pressurizing them to take down the software by threatening them with legal steps. This led to a mirroring campaign, due to what we call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a> nowadays.
There’s been some litigation in the early 2000s, where judges ruled in favor of the copyright holders.
However, this has little relevance to the case of youtube-dl, as the EFF explains. Reverse-engineering YouTube’s code doesn’t enable users to save copies of the material, they already can do so in many other ways. Also, youtube-dl doesn’t bypass DRM technologies like Google’s Widevine. Also, there’s many resources under free licenses on the video platform, which users are explicitly allowed to download and share. And in the U.S., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress">Library of Congress</a> may even <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2018/10/new-exemptions-dmca-section-1201-are-welcome-dont-go-far-enough">issue exemptions of Section 1201</a> of the DMCA, under which bypassing anti-circumvention is fine legally.</p>
<p>EFF’s notice summarizes the situation as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, youtube-dl does not violate either the Copyright Act or the DMCA. EFF  and  the  youtube-dl  maintainers  thank  GitHub  for  standing  up  for  the  rights  of developers whose projects it hosts. We hope this explanation will allow you to restore the youtube-dl repository so that GitHub can continue to be the home for development of this popular and important tool.</p>
<p>– <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2020/11/17/eff_letter_to_github_re_youtube-dl_11152020.pdf">EFF letter to GitHub on youtube-dl takedown</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, EFF! You did not just helped a tool that is crucial to journalists, activists, lawyers and so many other people. You also destroyed the RIAA’s wrong claims, which will hopefully prevent similar attacks on other tools in the future.</p>
<h2 id="githubs-reactions">GitHub’s reactions</h2>
<p>Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this. They likely were not prepared well enough for such a situation. GitHub did not stand up for the community that made them the most popular hosting platform for software in the world.</p>
<p>Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, later apparently reached out to the youtube-dl team personally, expressing his sympathy, and offering some support. However, the damage was already done then. The team lost its primary communication channel to their users and each other, as well as the entire history.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that their PR department recognized they are criticised heavily for taking down the project in the first place, putting their (actually pretty good) relation to the open-source community at risk, and thus creating a serious threat to their business.</p>
<p>At least this case prompted them to rethink their strategy on future lawsuits. They posted a <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">blog article</a>, excusing their takedown with compliance, as expected. They promised changes for the benefit of projects threatened by similar requests in the future at least, such as donating to a “developer defense fund” dedicated to helping out projects threatened by such anti-circumvention takedown requests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they recognized that there is a strong need for maintainers to access the issues and pull requests. They promised to ensure that developers can export those after a takedown (even if requests are valid). The real question however is why they wouldn’t just keep showing them, and just hide the code repository. Introducing such an option globally for every repository would be an even bigger improvement, allowing developers to always create backups of those data.</p>
<p>As GitHub state themselves, among all DMCA takedown requests, these circumvention ones are quite rare. We will have to see whether it is going to have a lot of effect. It would be better if they just donated money to defend developers of projects for which they receive <em>any</em> kind of unwarranted takedown request, rather than limiting it to this edge case.</p>
<p>By the way: in the end, it’s up to the people to request better copyright laws from the politics. They tend to get worse, not better. Make sure your voice is heard. Call your representatives (that’s better than sending a mail, as a phone call can hardly be ignored). Go on the streets and protest against changes and for improvements <em>for you as a user</em>. Support campaigns of civil rights organizations trying to change the laws.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Maintainers who host their projects on large proprietary platforms like GitHub or GitLab’s cloud offering should always have a strategy for such situations. They should set up mirrors of the code proactively. Backing up metadata is significantly harder (especially if platforms don’t provide import/export tools, which most of the big ones do not). Some people use the project import features in tools like <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a>, but as those are one-off features, one would have to repeat the process every now and then. For the issues, there is an experimental tool called <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug">git-bug</a>, which allows offline backups and migrations, and comes with bridges to import and export to a variety of tools (and is <a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug#help-needed">looking for contributors</a> to add new bridges and extend the functionality).</p>
<p>It looks like the free software community should prepare themselves better in the future. We should develop better tools to back up our metadata, also allowing us to move between platforms more easily.
If GitHub wants to remain the most popular hosting platform, they should consider adding such functionality out of the box (ideally in a standardized format). Offering such functionality doesn’t mean that projects would just leave for other platforms automatically. It would rather show that GitHub is really committed to the idea of open-source software, whose development can take place everywhere. After all, we are the ones who helped GitHub become the number one platform for software development in the world.</p>
<p>There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court. The true solution, as we have seen in this situation, is to stay calm, analyze the situation, assess the threat to your own project and remove code and text that could be abused to justify such a request (e.g., if you are developing a similar project and also use such songs in a unit test, you can change your test to content under free licenses). Moving to another platform does not solve the root issue, and …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="soul-a-new-language-now-in-v10-makes-audio-coding-vastly-more-accessible">SOUL, a new language now in V1.0, makes audio coding vastly more accessible</h3>

<h5 id="january-20-2021">January 20, 2021</h5>

<p>London — Today’s release of SOUL, the new universal language for audio applications, will dramatically lower barriers and expand access for developers creating any apps that depend on audio, as well as providing a more efficient architecture for audio processing.</p>

<p>SOUL has reached version 1.0 status with its language, compiler, and “SOUL patch” format all stable, tested, and ready to use in a wide variety of audio-related projects.. The team, led by JUCE and Tracktion creator Julian Storer, is already at work on an array of other SOUL tools including a visual editor and a developer portal.</p>

<p>“SOUL will revolutionize audio app development, eliminating challenges that have impeded developers for too long,” said Julian Storer, Head of Software Architecture at ROLI. “The need for a radical rethink of how audio apps are made has only become more urgent since I started the SOUL project in 2016. I’m tremendously excited about the V1.0 released today and the additional tools to come.”</p>

<p>Both a programming language and a platform for creating audio plugins and apps, SOUL will solve four fundamental problems facing audio developers today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy to learn and use: C++, the standard language for audio app coding, is extremely difficult to learn. The SOUL language is much simpler and more intuitive. Browser-based tools and fast live testing make it even easier to use and master.</p>

    <p>More secure: Sandboxing untrusted third-party code adds performance overheads that are a particular problem for audio coding. SOUL uses an intermediate assembly language called HEART that is safe to run without sandboxing, making SOUL code far more secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimized for power and performance: CPU-intensive power consumption is a constant problem for developers. The SOUL language is far more efficient. It is specifically designed for performance, with its JIT engine matching an equivalent program written in native C++.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Achieves lowest latency: Latency in audio apps is another deep-rooted issue that to date is solved by running audio on dedicated audio hardware. SOUL unlocks ultra-low latency on devices without the need for embedded CPUs and DSPs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since debuting SOUL at ADC 2018, the team has continuously welcomed feedback through the open-source repository at https://soul.dev. This feedback has helped SOUL reach its V1.0 state today.</p>

<p>The SOUL team encourages developers to explore the language on soul.dev, read the documentation on the SOUL repository on Github, and give more feedback as the SOUL toolset continues to grow this year.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Back in 2018, we compared empirically the performance overheads of Go
and C++ with regards to the low-level calling convention: to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">pass
arguments</a>,
to <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">return multiple values</a>, and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">when propagating exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Those results were obtained with Go 1.10 and Clang 6.0. Since then,
compilers have evolved and we are now running with Go 1.15 and Clang
11.0. Have the findings changed since&nbsp;then?</p>
<p>The question of interest&nbsp;was:</p>
<blockquote>
What is cheaper: handling exceptions via <code>panic</code> / <code>recover</code>, or
passing and testing error results with <code>if err := <span>...;</span> err != nil {
return err }</code>?</blockquote>
<p>In fact, as we will see below, the conclusions are stronger today than
they were two years&nbsp;ago.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology">
<h2><a href="#id9">Methodology</a></h2>
<p>The reader is first invited to familiarize themselves with the
discussion of Go’s low-level calling convention as compared with C++’s
in the previous chapters of this series: <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html">as of 2018</a> and <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64-2020.html">as of 2020</a>. The 2018
analysis is still largely valid in 2020—the C++ calling convention did
not change, and Go introduced a few optimizations on the
implementation of <code>defer</code>.</p>
<p>There were three analyses&nbsp;previously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to measure argument passing and returning multiple values, we will
use exactly the same methodology as the previous two analyses <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-argument-passing-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a> and
<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-multiple-return-values-in-go-and-cpp.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>These analyses contain their benchmark source code, which is also
provided at <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2018-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a>. The
derivation of plots was entirely automated via <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>,
which we can thus&nbsp;re-run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>for the <a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html">third analysis</a>,
which measures and compares the cost of error returns with that of
throwing and catching exceptions, we are going to reuse the same
methodology, but a diffence source code for the benchmark. The new
source code has been uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/knz/callbench/tree/2020-results">github.com/knz/callbench</a> as
well. This difference is motivated&nbsp;below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use an upgraded benchmark system, configured as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CPU</span>: <span>AMD</span> Ryzen 7 3950X 3700.07MHz Family=0x17 Model=0x71&nbsp;Stepping=0</li>
<li><span>OS</span>: FreeBSD 13.0-<span>CURRENT</span>&nbsp;r366805</li>
<li>go version 1.15.5&nbsp;freebsd/amd64</li>
<li>C++ FreeBSD clang version 11.0.0&nbsp;(llvmorg-11.0.0-0-g176249bd673)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="experimental-results">
<h2><a href="#id10">Experimental&nbsp;results</a></h2>
<p>All the generated data files and Jupyter notebooks <a href="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/notebook.zip">can be downloaded
here</a>.</p>
<div id="findings-for-argument-passing-and-returning-multiple-values">
<h3><a href="#id11">Findings for argument passing and returning multiple&nbsp;values</a></h3>
<p>Here the findings are largely unchanged from 2018: for the selected
benchmark code, the code generation by our selected compilers has not
changed&nbsp;significantly.</p>
<p>Only the new hardware <span>CPU</span> influences the measurements: the new <span>CPU</span> has
a higher clock frequency than previously, so for an equivalent
mix of instructions we expect and observe a 10-40% raw performance
improvement. Additionally, the Ryzen 7 3950X architecture has a
somewhat more powerful superscalar execution unit than the 1800X, and
is able to detect inter-instruction dependencies across more memory
accesses. This causes more measurements artifacts when the workload is
extremely small, and erases the performance differences between 1 and
5 function arguments or return&nbsp;values.</p>
<p>The main conclusions thus remain&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go uses memory to pass function arguments and return values. This
makes Go code perform about twice slower than equivalent C++ code on
function calls, where C++ compilers use register-based calling
conventions&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The particular <span>CPU</span> we used this year uses a micro-architecture able
to more aggressively optimize memory-heavy code, and so the Go
performance overhead relative to C++ is erased for very small
functions; unfortunately, these optimizations become ineffective with
more realistic, wider function&nbsp;bodies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Go, memory is used for return values even when there is just one
or two words worth of data. In these cases, a C++ compiler also
typically uses registers. This choice in the Go compiler is
unfortunate, as it mandates copying the return values through memory
at every call level when functions return each other’s value in a
cascade. This cost thus multiplies the overhead of the memory-based
return by the call depth, in a way that does not occur, or much
less, with a typical C++ code&nbsp;generator.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As previously, we can discuss what is the proportion of function
calls relative to other types of code. Arguably, in
computation-heavy algorithms, functions often get inlined so that calls
disappear. In that case, it is possible for the Go compiler,
assisted by the <span>CPU</span> micro-architecture, to reach similar instruction
throughputs as the equivalent C++&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>However, we can also point out that Go still promotes the use of
dynamic dispatch (via interface methods) as an idiomatic approach to
software design. For example, string composition via
<code>bytes.Buffer</code> interfaces with the <code>fmt</code> packages using
interface calls (<code>io.Writer</code>), and the proportion of
cross-interface calls is relatively high in that case compared to
the computation&nbsp;load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reader is invited to review the more detailed summaries from the
previous analyses, where the situation is presented in more&nbsp;detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="measuring-errors-vs-panics-reminder-and-code-tweak">
<h3><a href="#id12">Measuring errors vs panics: reminder and code&nbsp;tweak</a></h3>
<p>This analysis calls for a benchmark which performs a “unit of work” in
a loop, with the size of the loop configurable as&nbsp;“workload”.</p>
<p>We are modeling the extremely common case where any error inside a
unit of work aborts the entire workload: the error may or may not be
generated inside the unit of work, but needs only be detected once for
the entire outer workload&nbsp;loop.</p>
<p>In Go, we originally used the following code as&nbsp;benchmark:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this code, <code>leafErr</code> represents the “unit of work”, where errors
can originate. The <code>workErr</code> represents the main work computation,
where <code>leafErr</code> is called&nbsp;repeatedly.</p>
<p>(The <code>go:noinline</code> annotation is explained in more detail in the previous&nbsp;analysis.)</p>
<p>In the case where the <code>error</code> return is used, we need to check the
<code>err</code> return on every iteration of the loop. If we used exception
instead, we could factor the exception check out of the&nbsp;loop:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>res</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Exception check factored out of the loop:</span>
  <span>defer</span> <span>func</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>recover</span><span>();</span> <span>r</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}()</span>
  <span>// Main workload follows:</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafExc</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>panic</span><span>(</span><span>errObj</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(The accompanying C++ code is implemented similarly, using
<code><span>std::tuple</span></code> for error returns and <code>try/catch/throw</code> for&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>Just looking at the shape of the source code, we can already suspect
the findings that follow: there is less work inside the workload loop
when using exceptions. So as the workload increases, the cost of
setting up the “catch” logic gets&nbsp;amortized.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is exactly what was observed in 2018. (<a href="https://dr-knz.net/measuring-errors-vs-exceptions-in-go-and-cpp.html#summary-and-conclusions">Summary and
conclusions
here.</a>)</p>
<p>However, when running the same experiment in 2020 on our new test
machine, with Go 1.15, the measurements are all over the place, the
results appear chaotic, and the difference we observed last time is
nearly entirely erased. What&nbsp;happened?</p>
<p>It turns out that the new <span>CPU</span> used to run the benchmark really has a
much better micro-architecture. It is able to peek through the call
from the <code>work</code> function to the <code>leaf</code> function, analyze
inter-instruction dependencies across the call, and fully pipeline the
processing of the <code>leaf</code> function across multiple iterations of the
<code>work</code> loop. This effectively invalidates the model we used: in a
realistic application, there is enough complexity in the code inside
the “workload”, when it contains function calls, that the <span>CPU</span> cannot
pipeline loop&nbsp;iterations.</p>
<p>To restore a valid model, we should thus tweak the benchmark program
by adding just enough additional complexity in the “unit of
work”. Here, we achieve that by adding just one extra level of
intermediate&nbsp;call:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>arg</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Unlikely error case.</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>errObj</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// Common non-error case.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>id</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>),</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>leafErr</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>//go:noinline</span>
<span>func</span> <span>workErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>n</span> <span>int</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>work</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>intermediateErr</span><span>(</span><span>work</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>42</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>+=</span> <span>val</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>n</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(Likewise for the benchmark using&nbsp;exceptions.)</p>
<p>This program, at least on the <span>CPU</span> considered, is “complex” enough to
stop the superscalar unit from peeking across the function call. The
resulting code then behaves regularly in&nbsp;measurements.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings-for-error-returns-vs-exceptions">
<h3><a href="#id13">Findings for error returns vs&nbsp;exceptions</a></h3>
<p>The Jupiter notebook for this experiment contains the data processing steps
and the logic to generate comparison plots, with some detailed analysis
of the intermediate&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>The key result is the&nbsp;following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dr-knz.net/go-errors-vs-exceptions-2020/err-comparison.png"></p><p>What we see&nbsp;here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For an equivalent workload (e.g. 1000 “units of work”), the Go code
is 40% slower than the equivalent C++ code. This is generally
expected as Go is much more memory-heavy than&nbsp;C++.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the language considered, the cost of setting up an
exception “catch” can be reliably amortized across an entire
workload: the performance of code using exception-based error
reporting asymptotically converges to become the same as code using
no error handling&nbsp;whatsoever.</p>
<p>In comparison, code that propagates errors as return values is
systematically slower as the workload increases; between 1-3% for
C++, up to 4-10% for&nbsp;Go.</p>
<p>This is one of the two main&nbsp;results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The cost of setting up an exception “catch” is not entirely
negligible. Back in 2018, the mandatory fixed cost of the <code>defer</code>
setup and testing <code>recover()</code> in the <code>work</code> function was 50ns;
such that it took about 500 nanoseconds worth of “workload” to fully
offset this one-time&nbsp;cost.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/nixos-minecraft/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built from the ground up to make it easy to deploy
services. Tailscale is a peer-to-peer VPN built to make it easy to connect
machines. In this article I will show how to set up a Java Edition
Minecraft server (exposed only over Tailscale) in ten minutes on Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>Before you begin this guide, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> account</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> Java Edition account</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also need <a href="https://tailscale.com/start">a Tailscale account</a>. You can
make a free solo account using an <code>@gmail.com</code> address.</p>
<p>In NixOS one of the core principles is that the entire system is configurable
with a modular language called Nix. This allows you to configure everything
using a common syntax so you don’t need to remember every configuration file
format for every service you use. As such, you can configure an entire system
from a single file.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new configuration file called <code>host.nix</code> and set up a system that
has Tailscale start up on boot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span>{</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span># make the tailscale command usable to users</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span> <span>];</span>

  <span># enable the tailscale service</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This will have Tailscale start up, however to authenticate to Tailscale we need
to take a few more steps. First, head to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/authkeys">Pre-Auth Keys page in the admin
panel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/preauth-key.png" alt="The key creation screen from the Tailscale adminUI"></p>
<p>Create a new one-time use key and then copy it to your notes. We will use it
below.</p>
<p>With this key we can write a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files#the-service-section">systemd oneshot
unit</a>
that will log in to Tailscale using this key.</p>
<p>A systemd oneshot job is something that systemd expects to be run once as
opposed to being a persistent service. The above Digital Ocean link explains
this in more detail.</p>
<p>Copy this configuration below the <code>services.tailscale.enable</code> line in your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>

  <span># create a oneshot job to authenticate to Tailscale</span>

</span><span>      # wait for tailscaled to settle
</span><span>      sleep 2

  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure to replace <code>tskey-examplekeyhere</code> with the key you got from the Admin
panel. Without this key your VPS cannot connect to Tailscale.</p>
<p>Now that we have Tailscale configured to authenticate and connect to your
network, let’s enable the lightweight NixOS firewall so that we can only allow
Minecraft traffic over Tailscale. The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-firewall">NixOS
manual</a> has more
details, but at a high level we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the firewall</li>
<li>Mark tailscale0 as a trusted interface</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to Tailscale’s UDP port (don’t worry,
they will be rejected if they are not a part of your network)</li>
<li>Allow anyone on the internet to connect to your server’s SSH port (this will
also work over Tailscale, but having it exposed over the public internet can
help when debugging issues that happen before tailscale starts)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do that with the following configuration added to the end of your
<code>host.nix</code> file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>networking</span><span>.</span><span>firewall</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># enable the firewall</span>
    <span>enable</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>

    <span># always allow traffic from your Tailscale network</span>
    <span>trustedInterfaces</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>"tailscale0"</span> <span>];</span>

    <span># allow the Tailscale UDP port through the firewall</span>
    <span>allowedUDPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>services</span><span>.</span><span>tailscale</span><span>.</span><span>port</span> <span>];</span>

    <span>allowedTCPPorts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span> <span>22</span> <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can configure the Minecraft server. The <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=20.09&amp;show=services.minecraft-server.dataDir&amp;from=0&amp;size=30&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=services.minecraft-server">Minecraft
options</a>
expose a number of settings you can use to configure your server however you
want. Please note that you <em>must</em> set the EULA agreement to <code>true</code> yourself. The
Minecraft server is a closed-source program, so you must give NixOS permission
to use closed source packages.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span># ...</span>
  <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>minecraft-server</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>nixpkgs</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>allowUnfree</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now we have everything we need. We set up Tailscale, we configured an automatic
login to Tailscale, we set up the firewall so that it rejects all incoming
traffic (except for traffic from you Tailscale network) and finally we
configured the Minecraft server so that your can play in survival mode.</p>
<p>Now let’s get this put into a new Digital Ocean server. Open a new text editor
window and create a file called <code>user-data.yaml</code>. Copy this template into it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>write_files</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- <span>path</span><span>:</span><span> </span>/etc/nixos/host.nix<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>permissions</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"0644"</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>content</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>|
</span><span>      { pkgs, config, ... }:</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>{<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>runcmd</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- curl<span> </span>https<span>:</span>//raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect<span> </span>|<span> </span>PROVIDER=digitalocean<span> </span>NIXOS_IMPORT=./host.nix<span> </span>NIX_CHANNEL=nixos<span>-20.09</span><span> </span>bash<span> </span><span>2</span>&gt;<span>&amp;1</span><span> </span>|<span> </span>tee<span> </span>/tmp/infect.log<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>At the time of this article being written, Digital Ocean doesn’t have a NixOS
image by default. So we will use
<a href="https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect">nixos-infect</a> in order
to automatically replace an Ubuntu installation with a NixOS one. We are also
going to use it to automatically configure the server with the <code>host.nix</code> file
we just made.</p>
<p>Copy the contents of <code>host.nix</code> into the <code>content</code> value of the <code>write_files</code>
block. Be sure to indent the file by four spaces so that it will work as yaml
user data. When you are done you should have a file that looks something like
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Xe/b2f26ae62e7ff6f6030e4a94ed3e2707">this reference file</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have the cloud config, let’s launch the server in the cloud.</p>
<p>Open the Digital Ocean control panel and click Create and then click Droplets.
Choose an Ubuntu 20.04 image and a plan with at least 4 GB of ram (the Minecraft
server needs a lot of resources, unfortunately).</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/droplet-tier.png" alt="The droplet config using Ubuntu 20.04 and a droplet with 4 GB ofram"></p>
<p>Then choose a datacenter near you and enable the IPv6 and User Data options.
Paste the contents of your <code>user-data.yaml</code> file into the text box that shows
up. Choose your SSH key in the list of SSH keys that shows up and then give the
droplet a hostname, such as “minecraft”. If you want you can enable backups.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/user-data.png" alt="The droplet user data pasted into the user datafield"></p>
<p>Once you have everything set up, click the large green button labeled Create
Droplet. It may take up to 10 minutes to install and configure NixOS, however
you will be able to see the machine in your Tailscale network once everything is
done setting up. Go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>After it shows up in your network list, you can fire up your Minecraft
client and connect to your new server. You may need to select a slightly older
version of Minecraft if the in-game UI tells you to use an older version of
Minecraft. You can adjust the Minecraft version you are running using
<a href="https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-Changing-game-versions-">the launcher UI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/host-info.png" alt="The host information in the Tailscale controlpanel"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/server-connect.png" alt="The minecraft server connectionUI"></p>
<p><img src="https://tailscale.com/files/images/docs/guides/nixos-minecraft/minecraft-world.png" alt="An in-game screenshot of the author’s Minecraft avatar in a forestbiome"></p>
<p>If you want to administer your minecraft server, you can add the <code>mcrcon</code>
package to your system config next to the <code>tailscale</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>systemPackages</span> <span>=</span> <span>with</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>;</span> <span>[</span> <span>tailscale</span> <span>mcrcon</span> <span>];</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then you can connect to the Minecraft server command line with this command:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mcrcon -p hunter2
</code></pre><p>If you adjusted the rcon password above, you will need to adjust this command to
include that new password. From there you can change gamemodes, adjust the time
of day and anything else you want.</p>
<p>Once <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1084/sharing">node sharing</a> is generally
available, you can use it to invite people you trust to your server. (Node
sharing is still in private beta.) Generate an invite link in the admin panel
and they can use that to join your adventure.</p>
<p>If you want to make configuration changes to your server after you provision it,
edit the <code>/etc/nixos/host.nix</code> file in your favorite text editor (such as nano).
The <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration">NixOS
manual</a>
should help guide you if you want to install more services (such as backups
using <a href="https://christine.website/blog/borg-backup-2021-01-09">borgbackup</a> or
anything else listed in the <a href="https://search.nixos.org/options">options</a>). The
cloud’s the limit!</p>

The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

A <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2018/03/an-eleventh-century-chinese-coin.html">previous post</a> discussed a find of a Northern Song dynasty Chinese coin from England whose context suggested that it may have been a genuine ancient loss from the medieval period, along with a variety of textual and archaeological evidence for contact between England and East Asia in the Middle Ages. The following post returns briefly to this question, noting the recent discovery of a second Northern Song dynasty coin from England.&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--3nBO7B5Iko/X-MjGm2QgBI/AAAAAAADOLE/kpvCKTVJ84Iwh3lK_qblI19FdkxzYk7fwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1200/HAMPC2BC79.jpg"><img data-original-height="571" data-original-width="1200" height="238" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--3nBO7B5Iko/X-MjGm2QgBI/AAAAAAADOLE/kpvCKTVJ84Iwh3lK_qblI19FdkxzYk7fwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h190/HAMPC2BC79.jpg" width="500"></a></td></tr><tr><td>A copper-alloy Chinese coin of the Northern Song emperor Zhenzong, dated 1008–16, found near Petersfield, Hampshire (image: <a href="https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/924566">PAS</a>).</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p>The coin in question was issued between<i>&nbsp;</i>1008 and 1016 during the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Zhenzong">Emperor Zhenzong</a> of the Northern Song dynasty and was found at Buriton, Hampshire, around 9 miles from the coast. As was the case with the other eleventh-century Chinese coin discussed here <a href="https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/924566">previously</a>, the coin doesn't seem to be part of a 'suspicious' grouping of finds or deposited curated collection, and the field that it was recovered from has also produced a handful of medieval- and immediately post-medieval finds. These include a coin of King John minted at London in 1205–7, a medieval cut farthing of perhaps 1180–1247, two fragments of one or more medieval or early post-medieval vessels, and two mid-sixteenth-century coins. As such, it seems credible that this coin too could have been a medieval-era loss, and in this context it is worth noting that such Northern Song coins might quite credibly have arrived at any point up to perhaps the late fourteenth century, given that they continued to circulate in significant numbers well into that era.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Looking more generally, the fact that we now have two, rather than one, eleventh-century Northern Song dynasty coins from England, both recovered from what seem to be medieval to early modern sites, adds weight to the case for considering them genuinely ancient losses. Interestingly, this find was also made only around 20 miles away from the only confirmed medieval imported Chinese pottery from England, a sherd of blue-and-white porcelain from a small cup or bowl that was found in a late fourteenth-century context at Lower Brook Street, Winchester. As to the wider context for these coins, the evidence for the presence of people who had, or who may have, travelled from East Asia in England during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was surveyed in the <a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2018/03/an-eleventh-century-chinese-coin.html">previous post</a>, as was the evidence for people from Britain and Ireland in East Asia then. However, it is worth additionally drawing attention here to the 'global' distribution of medieval Chinese pottery and coins west of India, as mapped below, which demonstrates that finds of Chinese pottery and, to a lesser extent, coins outside of East Asia are by no means unknown.</p><p>With regard to the medieval Chinese pottery finds mapped below, substantial quantities have now been&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/afriques/1836">recognised</a>&nbsp;from around the Indian Ocean coast and in both the Persian Gulf and Red Sea areas into northern Egypt. Archaeological finds of Chinese porcelain&nbsp;<a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol16/16_063_078.pdf">from Europe</a>&nbsp;are much rarer, although definite examples are known from Winchester, Lucera (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary), along with a handful of surviving intact items that are believed to have entered Europe in the medieval era. The most famous of these are the so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317076925_A_Chinese_Porcelain_Jar_Associated_with_Marco_Polo_A_Discussion_from_an_Archaeological_Perspective">'Marco Polo jar'</a>, a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Chinese Qingbai porcelain jar found in the&nbsp;Treasury of San Marco in Venice, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Collections-Research/Collection/Resilience/Artefact/Sponge/54194ae6-5acb-43c1-b2e8-e7c13feb508c">Gaignères-Fonthill vase</a>, an early fourteenth-century Chinese Qingbai&nbsp;porcelain vase that was&nbsp;<a href="https://jekely.blogspot.com/2010/12/note-on-fonthill-vase.html">almost certainly</a>&nbsp;present in Naples in the fifteenth century. In addition to these, there are a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol16/16_063_078.pdf">documentary references</a>&nbsp;to Chinese pottery from medieval Europe. So, the 1323 will of&nbsp;Queen Maria of Naples and Sicily is believed to mention Chinese pottery, as does a 1363 inventory of property belonging to the Duke of Normandy and a 1379–80 inventory of Louis I, duke of Anjou. It also appears in, for example, a document from late fourteenth-century Genoa listing merchandise including porcelain, lustre ware and glass, and a 1456 inventory of the property of&nbsp;Piero di Cosimo de' Medici of Florence. As such, it seems clear that Chinese pottery was present in the households of the wealthiest people in Europe during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Turning to the medieval Chinese coins mapped below, these are recorded much less frequently as archaeological finds and do not appear in documents from Europe at all, although this latter is hardly surprising. The only other certain find from Europe is a find of a tenth-century coin from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/37163357/%D0%9B_%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D1%8F%D0%B4%D1%8A%D0%BA_%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%80_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%BE%D1%82_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%A2%D1%8A%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE_Early_Medieval_chinese_bronze_coin_from_Veliko_Tarnovo_district_%D1%81%D0%BF_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B8_%D0%AE%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%94%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B8_2017%D0%B3_%D0%A1%D1%84_2018%D0%B3_%D0%B1%D1%80_1_2_%D1%81_41_42">Bulgaria</a>, although a scattering are also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/5985193/J_Cribb_and_D_Potts_Chinese_coin_finds_from_Arabia_and_the_Arabian_Gulf_in_Arabian_Archaeology_and_Epigraphy_1996_no_7_pp_108_118">recorded</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/2566792/Northern_Song_coin_finds_in_Harla_Ethiopia_point_to_newly_found_silk_routes_from_China_to_the_Horn_of_Africa">East</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/5999530/Identification_of_a_Chinese_coin_found_in_Kuumbi_Cave_Zanzibar_by_prof_Felix_Chami">Africa</a>, the Persian Gulf, the coast of Arabia, India, and Sri Lanka, suggesting that it is not impossible that a handful of examples might have made their way to Red Sea or Persian Gulf ports and then into Europe.</p><p><b>The content of this post and page, including any original illustrations, is Copyright © Caitlin R.

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Comirnaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore.</p>

<p>To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. There is only one vendor for this analogue; <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a> and its partner <a href="https://www.tebu-bio.com/">tebu-bio</a> for the European market. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these COVID vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. In their July 2020 investor update BioNTech refers to usings TriLinks trinucleotide cap and hence this is likely part of the production method of the approved vaccine.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Ultimately, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and present bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6fcaac97-a79b-4d89-982d-fe0823edb7e0/ColSanders.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br><em>"It's not his fault he doesn't know mal Bogle" says Col. Sanders</em></p>
<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO8tIMQHFig" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J3bI261tBQ" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

January 19, 2021 | https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/container-networking-is-simple/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@if5: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns netns0</code></pre>
<p>Once we turn the devices on and assign proper IP addresses, any packet occurring on one of the devices will immediately pop up on its peer device connecting two namespaces. Let's start from the root namespace:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set veth0 up
$ sudo ip addr add 172.18.0.11/16 dev veth0</code></pre>
<p>And continue with the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0
$ ip link set lo up  # whoops
$ ip link set ceth0 up
$ ip addr add 172.18.0.10/16 dev ceth0
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
5: ceth0@if6: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0</code></pre>

<p>We are ready to check the connectivity:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0`, ping root's veth0

<p>At the same time, if we try to reach any other addresses from the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we are not going to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># Inside root namespace
$ ip addr show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000

# Try something from the Internet

<p>That's easy to explain, though. There is simply no route in the <code>netns0</code> routing table for such packets. The only entry there shows how to reach <code>172.18.0.0/16</code> network:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0` namespace:

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.1.1
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS &gt; New-ModuleManifest -Path mymodule/mymodule.psd1 -ModuleVersion "0.0.1" -Author "YourNameHere"
</code></pre><p>We have created the structure of the module. Now, let’s do a function called <code>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</code> containing the above script.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psm1</span>

<span>New-Alias</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>"ls3"</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span><span>(</span><span>$Path</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>$Path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  		<span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now edit our <em>mymodule.psd1</em> manifest file to add our function and alias for export. Find these two variables and edit them as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>#  mymodule/mymodule.psd1</span>
<span>$FunctionsToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles'</span><span>)</span>
<span>$AliasesToExport</span> <span>=</span> <span>@(</span><span>'ls3'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now copy our module folder <code>mymodule</code> to the following path (for all users) <code>/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules</code> or <code>~/.local/share/powershell/Modules</code> (for your user), and open new powershell session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-LastThreeDaysModifiedFiles</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>ls3</span> <span>/</span><span>your</span><span>/</span><span>path</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="most-used-modules">Most used modules</h2>
<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I started working on getting Racket CS to
compile and run on iOS and, with a lot of guidance from Matthew Flatt,
I managed to get it working (with some <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/351c0047d6371e36cf422b4627e020d14e8853fe/racket/src/ChezScheme/c/segment.c#L578-L587">caveats</a>).  <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3607">Those

Scheme built for your host machine in order to cross-compile things.
To build both of them, clone the <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket">Racket repository</a> and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/08fa24304ebf80a21ade32e8e59bb51b27af1dae/build.md#1-building-racket-from-source">build instructions</a>.  If you use the default <code>make</code> target, then
you’ll end up with a host Racket installation overlayed on top of the
<code>racket/</code> directory in the repository and with a build of Chez Scheme
at <code>racket/src/build/cs/c/</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you can cross-compile Racket CS for iOS by making a new build
directory within <code>racket/src/</code> and configuring a cross build by
specifying a custom prefix (so that the <code>make install</code> step won’t
overwrite the host Racket installation), the target <code>host</code>
architecture, a path to the iOS SDK (or the shorthand name “iPhoneOS”)
and the paths to the host Racket and Chez Scheme.</p>

XCode generates by default.  If you do this, you’ll have to update the
“Objective-C Bridging Header” setting in your “Build Settings” tab.

January 19, 2021 | https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/morphic-intro/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/morphic-intro/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In my previous two posts, I talked about Self as the language, and the system
which allows it to serialize objects into text format. Now let’s talk about
another big part of Self, which is the programming environment and the UI
toolkit that it is created from: Morphic.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-morphic">What is Morphic?</h2>
<p>Morphic is an abstract UI toolkit built for Self. It has backends for X11 and
Quartz, for GNU/Linux and macOS respectively. It is based on the idea of
<em>morphs</em>, which are known as widgets in modern UI toolkits. The difference here,
obviously, is the prototypical approach; it is after all written entirely in
Self, and so employs a prototypical-inheritance programming paradigm. All morphs
have a family tree that can be traced back to the original <code>morph</code> which
provides the building blocks for implementing your own morphs.</p>
<p>Now, consider this scenario: an update to Morphic is made (this scenario is
hypothetical), and a new field is added to the root <code>morph</code> object which must
propagate to all other morphs and is needed to display the morphs. Or a simpler
scenario; you want to change a default for all morphs and you want this change
to propagate to all other morphs. However, you might remember that we previously
talked about how instances in Self work and specifically, how they work by
<em>copying a prototype</em>. So how can we easily propagate new slot information from
parents to copied children? The answer is <strong>copy-downs</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="copy-downs">Copy-downs</h2>
<p>“Copy-down” is what Self calls replicating slots that exist in another object,
and updating those slots when that object changes. You may remember in the
previous post that an object had a few slots related to copy-down in its
annotation section.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self2/object_annotations.png" alt="The annotations that are available on an object."> <figcaption>
            <p>The annotations that are available on an object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the previous post we ignored these, but when programming in Morphic
copy-downs are important, so I’ll go into detail here. Copy-downs work by
sending the “copy-down selector” as a message to the “copy-down parent” (which
is an object), and then copying down the slots (except the ones listed in “slots
to omit”). This allows changes to parent objects to propagate as long as the
change is not omitted. This is similar to “sub-classing” in that it “inherits”
slots from a parent.</p>
<p>Copy-down is not a part of the Self language, but instead of the programming
environment that comes with it, and its implementation is done entirely within
annotations and the mirror system (we’ll look into mirrors later, just know that
mirrors are Self’s reflection system).</p>
<p><a href="https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/howtoprg.html#copy-down">The handbook section about
copy-down</a>
gives some important information about copy-downs, but nothing that is really
omitted here. At the end it mentions this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The least convenient aspect of using copy-downs is that to do the moral equivalent of creating a subclass, the programmer has to create two objects: a new traits object, and a new prototype, and then set the object annotation of the new prototype. Perhaps someday there will be a button to do this, or perhaps other styles of programming will emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out this document is outdated, as we <em>do</em> have a way to do this in Self
now which we will take advantage of in a short bit, when we start building our
own morph. For now, let’s take a look at what a morph actually is.</p>
<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-a-morph">The anatomy of a morph</h2>
<p>When we get the root morph prototype by typing <code>morph</code> in the shell and then
“Get it”, we get this object:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/morph_prototype.png" alt="The prototype morph."> <figcaption>
            <p>The prototype
<code>morph</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Most of the slots here isn’t of concern to us, because they are managed
automatically by Morphic when we send it messages (either directly with an
evaluator, or by interacting with the morph directly). A few points that might
be interesting are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hResizing</code>/<code>vResizing</code>: These determine how the object sizes itself
according to its parent or its children. There are three modes of resizing in
Morphic, which are:
<ul>
<li>Rigid: The object stays at its defined width and height and does not change
its size based on its surroundings, parents or children.</li>
<li>Shrink-wrap: The object resizes to wrap around its contents, and does not
grow larger.</li>
<li>Flexible (or space-filling): The object enlarges to fill available space.
If multiple sibling objects have this property, they all distribute the
width/height equally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>noStickOuts</code>: Morphic optimizes drawing if the morph is a simple rectangle
with nothing sticking out of it.</li>
<li><code>velcroFlag</code>: Kind of a weirdly named one. If this is <code>true</code> then the
submorphs of this morph cannot be yanked from the morph, and you cannot
drag-and-drop new submorphs to this morph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different “subclasses” of <code>morph</code> have their own unique slots. Thankfully,
the authors of Morphic have categorized each morph’s slots such that a morph
that is copied down from another will have its unique slots under a separate
category, which makes it a lot easier to see what belongs to which morph.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/morph_categories.png" alt="The frameMorph is copied down from rowMorph, which was itself copied down from morph. Each link in the chain categorizes its own slots separately."> <figcaption>
            <p>The
<code>frameMorph</code> is copied down from <code>rowMorph</code>, which was
itself copied down from <code>morph</code>. Each link in the chain categorizes
its own slots separately.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each morph may only appear once. If you use “Show Morph” on an outliner for a
morph that already exists somewhere else, it will remove itself from there and
attach it to your hand (similar to the Javascript DOM in this respect).</p>

<p>As it stands, a complex morph with many submorphs in it is hard to inspect. The
submorphs of a morph are hidden inside a <code>vector</code> called <code>rawMorphs</code> and there’s
no easy way to display a tree of what submorphs are available in a morph.
Luckily, there is a tool in the Self programming environment that allows us to
easily inspect a submorph and its parents: the <em>core sampler</em>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_idle.png" alt="Core sampler in
the idle state."> <figcaption>
            <p>Core sampler in
the idle state.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core sampler will list all the morphs under its “magnifying glass” (the
crosshair), starting from the innermost one up to the outermost. Each entry in
the list allows you to see its color, and to see and modify its resizing mode.
You can also middle-click an entry to access the morph’s properties panel and
also get an outliner for the morph.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_list.png" alt="A core sampler
listing the submorphs in an outliner, with their colors (on the left) and their
resize modes (two buttons on the right)."> <figcaption>
            <p>A core sampler
listing the submorphs in an outliner, with their colors (on the left) and their
resize modes (two buttons on the right).</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To access the core sampler, simply right-click any existing morph and select
<code>Core sampler...</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sin-ack.github.io/images/self3/core_sampler_open.png" alt="Opening the core
sampler."> <figcaption>
            <p>Opening the core
sampler.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The core sampler is extremely helpful to figure out why a submorph is
misbehaving, because you can directly see its hierarchy and open an outliner for
it, debugging the morph as it operates. This is one of my favorite parts of
Self, because you interact with the system while it’s running, having all
debugging info at hand.</p>
<p>Now that we looked into Morphic, let’s build something with it.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-application-with-morphic">Building an application with Morphic</h2>
<p>Let’s build a desktop calculator. It’s better than a toy example (because it
actually does something) while being simple enough that this post won’t become

<p>Let’s start out by copying <code>frameMorph</code>, which provides a rectangular frame

<p>Earlier we talked about copy-downs and said this is how we create “sub-classes”
of morphs. We will now copy-down <code>frameMorph</code> as the basis of our

(this is the easy method of copying down we talked about earlier). When asked
for a copydown selector, leave it as the default and click “Okay”.</p>

        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>I’ve often heard that writing a compiler is hard, and different than writing other kinds of software.
Some recent experience hsa provided me insight as to why this is the case and proved quite interesting!</p><p>I recently completed work on a new big feature in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a>. I’d been working on it for ~2 months and it ended up being the hardest code that I’d ever written in my life.
I’ve been coding for decades and have worked on so many different projects, and for some very big organisations;
I tell you this for context. When I say this is the hardest code I’ve <em>ever written</em>, it had a lot of competition.
Concurrent systems usually has the reputation of being very difficult and I’ve designed and written a massively concurrent project
from the ground up in my OO days, included writing all the scheduling and concurrency primitives, and managing all the thread-safety myself (those were different times).
I found this piece of work an order of magnitude harder than that.</p><p>I say in the ShipReq <a href="https://blog.shipreq.com/about">About</a> page that <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> is like a compiler.
The big feature that I completed recently was the most compiler-like feature yet, and to my surprise it’s specifically that property that made it so deceptively hard.
What is the feature?
Basically when you have a bunch of requirements / issues / design documents / whatever,
this feature adds automation to populate certain fields according to their relationships and related fields so that
users don’t have to manually edit or maintain it all themselves, which is both tedious and error-prone.
An example would be if someone raises a bug which requires a few dev tasks to fix, one could setup their project so that when all those dev marks are marked as
“complete” the bug itself automatically changes to “ready for testing”.
This feature doesn’t have any knowledge of “completion” or “testing”, but allows users to define whatever states and rules they want.
That might not sound like it relates to writing a compiler.
(It probably doesn’t even sound hard.)
Nor do requirements, bug reports, project documents seem very relatable to code.
But there are surprising similarities. Let’s take a look…</p><h2>Similarity #1: Relationships</h2><p>Nearly all data relationships in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> are many-to-many / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAGs</a>.
Some views in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> present data as flat lists but under-the-hood it’s very rare that anything is stored as a flat list,
and there’s nearly always a way to view the same data as a graph or tree.</p><p>If you squint a bit, source code is kind of like that too.
Packages have multiple classes / objects which have multiple methods / fields / inner classes that have multiple statements that have multiple clauses, etc.
In terms of declaration, it’s more one-to-many than many-to-many but it’s still all a big DAG.
When we start considering relationships like imports and methods calling other methods, then it becomes many-to-many too and we get a cyclic graph.</p><h2>Similarity #2: Interactions</h2><p>Secondly, this new feature in <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> is very configurable by users.
It’s a major goal of <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> to avoid hardcoding implicit assumptions and find appropriate and configurable abstractions.
Obviously having users need to reconfigure everything all the time would be a terrible burden so we provide pre-configured
complete setups with best-practices which users can (optionally) use, and can reconfigure without restriction to best serve their needs.
What that means from a coding point of view, is that we never know the automation rules at compile-time.
The code needs to understand and apply all the rules at runtime, and it needs to be able to
recognise and handle data and logic combinations that invalidate invariants. That might not sound like a big deal but there are
many invariants in a complex system and invariants don’t stop at their immediate domain boundary - they propagate
though all relevant graphs and compose, with various levels of complexity, with other invariants.</p><p>For example you may have 10 simple invariants in 10 isolated domains, but when they’re all combined the number of states
to consider becomes 10,000,000,000 and there’s going to be a very significant percentage of those states that you’d consider
illegal (i.e. bugs).</p><p>This too is like writing a compiler.
For example, the Java compiler doesn’t hardcode the privacy level of your classes; it allows you to set it yourself.
Where as <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> might have a UI page for config, in Java you have modifier keywords such that <code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span></code> is different than <code><span>private</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span></code>.
From the perspective of writing a compiler, these are runtime values with runtime rules.
When we consider additional keywords like <code>final</code> and <code>abstract</code> we start getting into what I meant about combinational explosions.
The Java compiler, at runtime, has to ensure all possible combinations are valid. For example, it will reject the following code:</p><div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>final</span> <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>and</p><div data-language="java"><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>Hello</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Imagine you were writing your own Java compiler.
It’s entirely up to you to think about those illegal combinations and then write the code to catch them.
I think we all take for granted things like marking a method as private and then knowing it’s impossible to
call externally, but under-the-hood that it’s not impossible at all. You’re literally relying on someone’s
<code>if</code> statement in the right place. Just like my <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a> example, it’s all value inspection at runtime,
with no guarantees about how all the features will interact. The class/method privacy feature interacting
with <code>final</code> and <code>abstract</code> features is mentally easy enough but every single feature has the ability to
interact badly with something else and it’s not always easy to identify those combinations.</p><p>I recently saw <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PR to Scala</a> that’s a great
demonstration of exactly this.
The <code>private</code> and <code>sealed</code> keywords have been in Scala forever and someone only <em>just</em> recently
came up with the realisation that private classes are effectively sealed.
Scala’s been in existence for 16 years!
When you have hundreds of features it doesn’t seem feasible to manually consider each possible combination.
100 features yields 4950 unique pairs. There’s nothing special about pairs though, some issues may only
manifest when three specific features intersect. For 100 features there are:</p><ul><li>4950 unique sets of 2</li><li>161,700 unique sets of 3</li><li>3,921,225 unique sets of 4</li><li>…</li><li>17,310,309,456,440 unique sets of 10</li></ul><p>It’s not unlikely to have a bad interaction between 10 features out of a possible 100.
It’s just impossible to manually consider.</p><h2>Similarity #3: Type-Unsafety</h2><p>Type-safety is a pillar that I depend on all the time. And no please don’t think of Java’s type system
when you think type-safety, that’s not really what I mean, although it’s a start.
I mean more the type systems in languages like <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scala</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell</a>, think features like existential and dependent types.
Type systems like Java’s and Typescript’s are great! They add value! But you can be an order of magnitude or two
more safe with more advanced type systems and it’s profoundly beneficial when you learn how to make good use of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, type-safety didn’t help me very much when developing my big feature.
Say you’ve got one data location than can accept a set of values. At compile-time, every runtime value is acceptable
because there always exists a configuration that would allow each possible value to be legal.
It’s like having a ‘Name’ field of type <code>String</code>, and then a runtime rule dictating the required first letter of the name.
<em>(Unrealistic but it’s the concept I’m highlighting.)</em>
The configuration might be <code>firstNameLetter<span>:</span> Option<span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span></code>. In such a case you <em>have to</em> have the name field
be something accommodating of all possibilities, like <code>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span></code>.
You could be tricky an create a type that encodes a proof of the name such that it adheres to the rule, but that’s only
a derivation of <code><span>(</span>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> firstNameLetter<span>:</span> Option<span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></code>.
Unless the name and the configuration and atomically modifiable as a single, composite value, you still need to
store both values independently before such a derivation.
The first-letter of a name restriction is a toy example but it demonstrates the fact that you have runtime configuration
in one location, runtime data in the other, and no type-safety at compile-time to enforce that the right thing happens at runtime.</p><p>Compilers have the same problem. They maintain a huge repository of runtime data, and it’s entirely up to the compiler authors
to apply all of the rules, move data in and out of scope depending on other runtime-only conditions, etc, etc.
And unlike us compiler <em>users</em>, they don’t have the benefit of being able to rely on (much of) a type system.
They’re on their own and can only use type safety to guard the bottom layers of their very-complex domain.</p><h2>Similarity #4: Feedback</h2><p>It’s a necessary part of the process that things will go wrong, and users need to be provided meaningful feedback.</p><p>In the case of <a href="https://shipreq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipReq</a>, it will…</p><ul><li>detect changes that are always wrong, and prevent the user from making those changes. These are errors.</li><li>detect data/config that has become wrong, modify derivation accordingly, and present them to users in a fully-comprehensible manner. These are warnings.</li><li>collect all info required to explain to users exactly how, why and from where, derived data came to be.
Automatedly populating/amending users’ data is one thing, but I believe users should be able to inspect and understand things like
what steps were performed, and what data were factors.
This is provenance.
It doesn’t sound that hard but in practice it was surprisingly challenging to implement.</li></ul><p>Compilers do the same thing. They…</p><ul><li>detect illegal data and combinations of data at runtime, and explain them to users. Those are errors.</li><li>detect data that is acceptably or potentially wrong, handle them, maybe by ignoring the statement, or modifying the generated code somehow,
and then finally, they flag this to users. These are warnings.</li><li>some compilers calculate how something has come to be and …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>

<p>And when WhatsApp announced changes to their data-sharing policy, Signal exploded.</p>

<div data-id="3f0d7d8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

<p>But this rapid growth has introduced a UX complexity: the app is now being used by a much broader group of people.</p>

<p>Signal <em>may</em> be more private than WhatsApp, but if they ever want to rival their 2 billion users (yes, you read that correctly), then they’ll need a product that’s <strong>just as easy to use</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="7066953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The golden question is this: when the hype dies, will people be able to convince their lazy friends, who don’t care about internet privacy, to sign up?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="6777d1b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>The answer to that depends on a number of factors, one being how easy the experience of migrating from WhatsApp to Signal is. So let’s take a look.</p>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>
<h2 id="wood">Wood</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/wooden_frame.jpg" alt="Wooden Frame Router" title="Example Wooden Frame Router"></p>
<p>If you only have access to woodworking equipment, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdXpp77MdU">wood is your only choice</a>. The main advantages of wood are that it is cheap and easy to work with. The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>
