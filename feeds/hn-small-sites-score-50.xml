							<p>PARIS — The French Parliament unanimously agreed on Thursday to introduce a nationwide age verification system for pornography websites, months after President Emmanuel Macron pledged to protect children against such content.</p>
<p>Macron made the protection of children against adult content online a high-profile issue well before the coronavirus crisis hit. In January, tech companies, internet services providers and the adult movies industry <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/les-fournisseurs-d-acces-des-acteurs-du-web-et-marc-dorcel-s-engagent-pour-proteger-les-mineurs-du-porno-20200117" target="_blank">signed a voluntary charter</a>, pledging to roll out tools to help ensure minors don’t have access to pornographic content.</p>
<p>Within a broader law on domestic violence, the Senate decided <a href="https://www.publicsenat.fr/article/parlementaire/porno-le-senat-bloque-l-accessibilite-des-sites-aux-mineurs-183097" target="_blank">in June</a> to introduce an amendment requiring pornography websites to implement an age verification mechanism.</p>
<p>In order to enforce the law, the French audiovisual regulator CSA will be granted new powers to audit and sanction companies that do not comply — sanctions could go as far as blocking access to the websites in France with a court order.</p>
<p>The choice of verification mechanisms will be left up to the platforms. But lawmakers have suggested using credit card verification — a system first adopted by the U.K., which mulled similar plans to control access to pornography but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/16/uk-drops-plans-for-online-pornography-age-verification-system" target="_blank">had to drop them</a> in late 2019 because of technical difficulties and privacy concerns. Italy also approved a <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/gu/2020/06/29/162/sg/pdf" target="_blank">similar bill in late June</a>, which raised the same concerns over its feasibility and <a href="https://www.key4biz.it/filtro-anti-porno-nicita-agcom-limiti-tecnici-norma-pillon-a-rischio-disapplicazione/312167/" target="_blank">compliance with the EU laws</a>.</p>
<p>As private actors could implement their own solutions, the new law also highlights the challenges of digital identification. In Brussels, there are growing calls to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system that would allow users to bypass Google and Facebook’s identification ecosystem. For politicians, including French Junior Digital Minister Cédric O, systems of identification online are <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">a matter of digital sovereignty</a>.</p>
<p>The Senate has already voted on the bill. Following an agreement today between senators and lawmakers from the lower house National Assembly, a final vote will be held again in the Senate where the bill is expected to pass.</p>
<p>Senators have also suggested using FranceConnect, a tool developed by the state to help users connect to public services such as tax collection and health insurance.</p>
<p>In the face of skepticism and privacy concerns from campaigners, O has since <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/identite-numerique-le-cnnum-veut-soutenir-l-effort-deja-engage-par-le-gouvernement-39905257.htm" target="_blank">denied</a> that the national connection tool would be used.</p>
<p>"We voted on one principle, which is to give the CSA the obligation to monitor the protection of minors, but the CSA is free to find the right way for sites to comply with their injunction," the text’s rapporteur in the Senate Marie Mercier told POLITICO.</p>
<h3><strong>Minitel rose</strong></h3>
<p>Key actors from the French porn industry have long called for new measures to modernize a French law which was drafted at the time of the “Minitel rose,” a very popular pornography service in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“[With this law] we can already fine up to 75,000 euros and three years of prison, but no one applies it,” said Mercier.</p>
<p>The conservative politician worked on the amendment after hearings with French pornography producer Marc Dorcel, ex-adult actress-turned-documentary-director Ovidie and child protection NGOs.</p>
<p>“Most of those who abide by the law feel that it’s unfair that the [sites] keep doing their business without restriction," Mercier added.</p>
<p>For years, one of the most difficult tasks for French regulators has been finding a way to enforce local laws on foreign services.</p>
<p>With this new law, if the site does not comply within 15 days after a first warning from the audiovisual regulator CSA, the regulator will be able to ask the Paris Court of Justice to send an order to telecom operators to block the access to these sites from France.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting year! When the pandemic came and left us all housebound, I used it as an excuse to do some remedial work I’d been dreading—moving Pinboard onto modern versions of PHP and MySQL. Things had gotten to the point where I couldn’t even run a bug-for-bug identical copy of the site on a modern laptop, and the servers themselves were overdue for system upgrades. 

</p><p>Much of the core code on the site dated back to 2009-2010 and was written by Past Me, a vindictive, inscrutable nemesis who devoted his life to sabotaging Present Me. 

</p><p><img src="https://idlewords.com/images/past_me.jpg">

</p><p><i>Past Me laying his snares in 2009.</i></p>

<p>Doing this on a live system is like performing kidney transplants on a playing mariachi band. The best case is that no one notices a change in the music; you chloroform the players one at a time and try to keep a steady hand while the band plays on.  The worst case scenario is that the music stops and there is no way to unfix what you broke, just an angry mob. It is very scary.

</p><p>But I got it done! It helped in this process that I was in Japan, since I could do most work at night while my US/European customers slept or wept into their phones or whatever it is people do at night nowadays. 

</p><p>The site is now on a 2020 foundation (specifically, it’s on PHP 7 and a current MySQL), and with everything less brittle I can start making bigger changes. One of those is to make the site look okay on mobile phones, now that I’m finally convinced they aren’t a fad. You can see the beginnings of this reworking on the <a href="https://pinboard.in/about/">about page</a> and in other corners of the site.

</p><p>Another is to finish the new API. The current one was designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old Delicious API and lacks important features, like any way to say “show me stuff that has changed since timestamp X”, or interact with Pinboard features that weren’t present in Delicious.

</p><p>Another analogy I’d use for this kind of upgrade work is clearing a disused garden. In the process you may unearth remarkable stuff—an old wagon wheel, a Roman urn—hiding among the weeds. But it’s mostly interesting to you, and not to the people who are waiting in line at your vegetable stand.

</p><p>In my case, I found the skeletons of dead features (remember placemarks?) as well as spectral ghosts of defunct services like Google Reader, Readability, and of course Delicious itself, which now slumbers peacefully while I try to figure out a way to bring it up without dealing with the waves of automated spam still pointed at the site. But I’ll save that for another post.

</p><p>Now that I have a fresher memory of how the site works, and am not so afraid of touching anything, I look forward to doing some long-delayed feature development.
 
</p><p>Meanwhile, thanks to everyone for using the site for another year! Not everyone gets to be around long enough to have to do major upgrades, and I am grateful to be in that position, thanks to all of you.

<p>Another new blog on the internet – aren’t there already enough of
those? <a href="http://tttthis.com/blog/if-i-could-bring-one-thing-back-to-the-internet-it-would-be-blogs">Some would say
no</a>.
I, for one, am a fan of the open, interoperable, indie web,
even if that seems to stack the cards against you.<sup id="fnref:indie-disadvantage"><a href="#fn:indie-disadvantage">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I’ll keep this introductory post brief. We<sup id="fnref:we"><a href="#fn:we">2</a></sup> want to start a SaaS
product, and while there seem to be awfully many “founder stories”
around of people magically getting 50k downloads, $10k MRR, etc., we
don’t often hear about the long, rocky path to sustainable success.
There’s often scant detail about the initial steps: ideation,
validation, etc. Also, all these whiz-bang success stories suffer
from enormous survivorship bias. Not to mention they leave us normal
folks feeling quite inadequate, when in reality there’s enormous luck
involved, too.<sup id="fnref:luck"><a href="#fn:luck">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “failure” isn’t sexy. As a result there seem to be few
resources online talking about the things people have tried that
<em>haven’t</em> worked. We want to take a more optimistic view. From each
“failure” we hope to learn things, get better at what we’re trying to
do, so that 10 years from now, looking back, we can point at all the
hustle that goes into trying to Build Something.</p>
<p>We figured we might as well challenge ourselves to get something out
there, right now, instead of waiting until perhaps one day if and/or
when we manage to create something successful. This way, at the very
least we’re keeping ourselves accountable by publicly writing about
what we’re trying, and who knows, we might be able to say something
that someone somewhere finds useful. We’re also very keen for
feedback, so any and all input is more than welcome. Ideas, critique,
links to resources, we want it, our inboxes are open. Have a look at
the <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/contact/">Contact us page</a> if you want to get in touch, or try our
low-budget comments box down below!</p>
<p>We’re just trying to muddle along making our own way here, so we’re
bound to have many a false start, but we are trying something new to
us – <a href="https://exsaasperated.com/mailing-list/">join us for the ride</a>, and we’ll see what happens!</p>

<p>I tried <a href="https://www.hey.com/">Hey</a>, the new e-mail service built by Basecamp. It is great, simple, smart. They’ve put a lot of thoughts behind re-inventing email. There are some pretty interesting features but fundamentally what is different is the opinionated workflow on which it operates.</p>

<p>The only mail that lends into the “Imbox” (how they name the important inbox) is from senders the user allowed. The first time they receive an email from someone, it ends in a staging zone, and then the user need to screen senders and decide if they want to receive emails from them, and where they want these email to lend: 1. in the imbox, 2. in a set of “feeds” (email that is casually read), 3. in the “paper trail” (receipts, …).</p>

<p>I liked the overall experience of Hey, and was about to subscribe. However there are two things that are a no-go for me. It doesn’t support custom domains for email addresses (yet)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, and there is no “archive” feature<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. So I decided against that.</p>

<p>But I really liked the workflow, and I figured it shouldn’t be that big of a deal to re-create something similar in a plain-old mailbox.</p>



<p>Here’s what I need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Senders need to be screened for their spam to be allowed in my inbox. I figured this can probably be done by redirecting mail from senders I never screened into a sub-folder and reviewing that occasionally.</li>
  <li>Screening senders need to be dead easy. That’s the beauty of Hey: screening is done by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button. That’s why it works, no non-sense of creating or editing rules.</li>
  <li>Support the same kind of classifying structure. I already had a <em>newsletter</em> folder with a few manually created rules, and a <em>reference</em> folder in which I would occasionally put a mail that I wanted to retrieve easily - this is just automating that.</li>
  <li>Works from my computer or my phone, using existing apps. There is no point in starting a multi-month project and implement a working email UI, this needs to fit within my limited evenings and kids naps.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance, for the same reason.</li>
</ol>



<p>So I built <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">Screenr</a>.</p>

<p>Screenr plugs to an email server<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, monitors email in folders, and classifies email into a set of folders.</p>

<p>Incoming emails from unknown senders (i.e. with an email address that has not been seen yet) are moved to a “For screening” folder. Emails from screened senders are moved based on configuration: either leave in the inbox, or move it to a particular folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Inbound mail] --&gt; B(Inbox)
	B --&gt; C["Sender screened?"]
	C --&gt;|No| D("Move to 'For Screening'")
	C --&gt;|Yes| E(Move to configured folder)
</code></pre>

<p>To configure the tool, I just need to screen emails in the “For screening” folder occasionally, and move them based on where I want these to land: move emails from senders I still want in my inbox to a <em>Screened</em> folder (which then gets moved back into the inbox once Screenr registered the decision). Move emails I want to reject to a <em>Rejected</em> folder. Move emails I barely care about, such as newsletters, promotions, etc. into a <em>newsletter</em> folder. Move receipts, booking confirmations, order tracking info, tax documents, etc. into a <em>Reference</em> folder. If I move a single email between two monitored folder, then Screenr will move all of the mail from that sender into the new folder.</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	A[For screening] --&gt; C[Decide what to do with this sender]
	C --&gt;|Allow in inbox| D("Move to 'Screened'")
	C --&gt;|Ok but classify elsewhere| E(Move to the folder you want)
	C --&gt;|Don't want mail from them| F(Move to 'Rejected')
</code></pre>

<p>Screenr supports two configurations (at the folder level) to classify email: either move the email directly to the target folder, or through an intermediary “classification” folder (like the “Screened” folder for email for inbox). The reason for that is that you might want to occasionally classify email without creating a rule: e.g. if my spouse forwards me a booking confirmation it’s nice to file it into the <em>Reference</em> folder without automatically classifying everything she sends me as reference<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Bonus points: now I can change my default behavior for new email based on where I’m at. I archive email in my inbox - the reduced amount of email there makes inbox 0 much easier to attain - and delete email in the “newsletter” folder. Less thinking, inmore better.</p>



<p>There are 4 folders I’m watching:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/folders.jpg" alt="The folders I'm monitoring"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Inbox</em> is the email that I (probably) care about. Once I read it, I archive it.</li>
  <li><em>Newsletter</em> is the stuff that I’m occasionally browsing, but it’s mostly composed of automatically sent emails and newsletters and there’s likely no required action. Once I read it, I (most likely) delete it.</li>
  <li><em>Papertrail</em> receives all my order confirmation, plane tickets, vouchers, etc. It usually just stays there. I used to call it <em>Reference</em> but I like Hey’s name better. Some of the mail I manually move there, mostly when my parents send me a scan of a bank record, or my wife sends me some reservation, because I don’t want to classify them there.</li>
  <li><em>For screening</em> is all the mail that I’m receiving from senders I haven’t reviewed yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>When something arrives in <em>For screening</em>, first I get excited because that’s proof that Screenr still does its job. Then I decide what to do with it by moving it in one of the folders:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/screening.jpg" alt="The folders I use for screening"></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Screened</em> is for emails I want in my inbox, like people I know, notifications I care about, etc. Screener registers my decision then move it (and potentially other emails by that sender) back into the inbox</li>
  <li><em>File in papertrail</em> is the same as screened, but for my <em>papertrail</em> folder.</li>
  <li><em>Rejected</em> is for what’s not exactly a spam, but I don’t actually want. Examples are emails from my car dealership, which is mostly spam, but which also sends me service confirmation once in a while, which I then go fishing in that folder and redirect to reference. Or companies who want me to wish them happy birthday:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.feval.ca/img/2020/screenr/spam.jpg" alt="Example of some spammy email"></p>



<p>I wanted reasonable portability, my email provider recently released a bare-bones nodejs hosting and I figured I could give it a shot, so I settled for typescript. That host was hardly controllable, so I ended giving up and re-hosting onto the Kubernetes cluster from which you retrieved this static HTML page in a vastly over-complicated setup instead (more on this in <a href="https://www.feval.ca/posts/k8s-static/">this blog post</a>).</p>

<p>The application itself is decomposed into 4 layers following the onion architecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>domain</code>, contains the actual classification logic</li>
  <li><code>contracts</code>, contains interfaces and data exchange structures for the dependencies that the domain will need an implementation for, such as <code>IMailbox</code> which allows retrieving emails or moving them around, <code>Mails</code> which are those mails, or <code>IScreeningStorage</code> which provides interfaces to store screening behavior or retrieve it based on sender.</li>
  <li><code>infrastructure</code>, which are the particular implementations for those dependencies: an <code>IMAPMailbox</code> implementing <code>IMailbox</code> which provides said features for an IMAP server.</li>
  <li><code>application</code> which binds all the stuff together: loads configuration, instantiate infrastructure, inject in domain, then kick off the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the storage of screening results, I settled on a file-based system which stores everything in memory and serializes it back to a file in storage when new rules are detected.</p>

<p>Building the IMAP connector was the most painful. The client libraries in the node ecosystem are not super well maintained and documented<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, I tried two, and diagnosing some issues I was having<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">6</a></sup> was a straight pain that almost made me abandon. In retrospect I would probably pick .Net Core instead, given that the IMAP libraries are much more solid. If I want to make evolutions on that, I don’t exclude a rewrite ; the languages are sufficiently close that this wouldn’t be a big thing to do.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the hosting is done on a k8s cluster. A Helm chart specifies a single deployment with no service, and mounting a file share inside the container to store and retrieve the settings. Here is the extent of the infrastructure:</p>

<pre><code>graph TD
	  A[Pod] --&gt; C[File share]
</code></pre>



<p>To run Screenr, you need a computer that can run node ; ideally a server that you don’t turn off.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source is on <a href="https://github.com/cfe84/screenr">GitHub</a> and the Readme explains how to configure it. Clone the repo locally, then run <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm run build</code>. To start it, go with <code>npm run start</code>.</li>
  <li>Compiled version is on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenr">npm</a>.</li>
  <li>Docker image is on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cfe84/screenr">DockerHub</a> (or <code>docker pull cfe84/screenr</code>). Kubernetes Helm Chart are available in the git repo.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are some optimizations that could be done. For starters, this could use IMAP notifications to actually listen for new mail, rather than reconnecting and checking every 20s. I went for the straight forward thing right now, not sure if it’ll be a problem. Also this could be extended to support more rules, but it might require some more UI work which I don’t want to do, so that’s it for now.</p>

<p>The Roman roads diagram project is a series of maps driven by an unconventional idea: what if we represented Ancient Rome’s famed road network in the style of a modern transit map?</p>
<p>So far I’ve made five diagrams (below). Click for more information.</p>
<p>You can see how my style has evolved since I made the first map back in 2017. My ultimate goal is to make a book out of these. I’ll probably have to redesign a few of them.

Don't believe me? Why not quickly <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/postgres-intro">spin up a database</a> and see it for yourself with this query:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_database</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In this post, we'll explore these template databases and see how we can make full use of their potential. We'll even look into creating a template database of our own.</p><h2>template1</h2><p>By default, running:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>simply copies everything from the database <code>template1</code>. We can modify this template database in any way: add a table, insert some data, create new extensions, or install procedural languages. Any of these actions would be propagated to subsequently created databases.</p><p>This, however, is <strong>not</strong> advisable. Removing any one of these modifications would need you to manually uninstall or drop these changes from <code>template1</code>. You do have the option to drop and recreate the entire <code>template1</code> database altogether. This unfortunately comes at the risk of committing a mistake along the way, effectively breaking <code>CREATE DATABASE</code>. It would be better to leave <code>template1</code> alone and create a template database of your own.</p><h2>Custom Template Databases</h2><p>To set an existing database as a template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> template_db_name </span><span>WITH</span><span> is_template </span><span>TRUE</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Doing this allows any user or role with the <code>CREATEDB</code> privilege to utilize it as a template.

We could think of this template database as a fallback if anything irreversible happens to <code>template1</code>. As such, this template database should never be modified in any way as soon as the database cluster has been initialized. To create a database with <code>template0</code> as the template database:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h3>Applications</h3><ul><li>If anything goes wrong with <code>template1</code>, It can be dropped and recreated with <code>template0</code> as the template database.</li><li>We can also create a clean database that does not contain any modifications present in <code>template1</code>. This would be useful when restoring from pg_dump. Any conflicts brought about by modifications not present in the dump are eliminated.</li><li><code>template0</code> can be used to specify new encodings. As pointed out in this <a href="https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/exploring-the-default-postgres-template-databases#:~:text=we%20can't%20edit%20the%20locale%20or%20encoding%20of%20a%20database%20copied%20from%20template1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>, creating a new database with <code>template1</code> and new encodings would result in an error.</li></ul><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name TEMPLATE template0 ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>DATABASE</span><span> new_db_name ENCODING </span><span>'SQL_ASCII'</span><span>;</span></p></div></div></div></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To quickly sum things up, we found out that new databases are, by default, created from a template database called <code>template1</code>. <code>template1</code> can be modified in any way we please and the changes would be present in any database created afterward. We can also create custom template databases and base new databases from them instead. If things go awry, <code>template0</code> is always there to help.</p></section><section><a href="http://eepurl.com/gPWkwn">SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER</a></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of recent design changes, GitHub has introduced READMEs for profiles. By <a href="https://dev.to/web/design-github-profile-using-readme-md-8al">creating a repo</a> with your name and adding <code>README.md</code> file with markdown to it, you can now add a rich description of yourself.</p><p>Here is an example of how it looks like:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_profile.jpg" width="650"></p><p>This feature may not be available to your profile yet. GitHub uses selectively rolling.</p><p>Unlike the old plain-text bio field, the new feature supports external links and images. This is where it gets interesting.</p><h2>Tracking profile views</h2><p>Since Github's markdown can display images from external sources, you can now track and display views of your profile.</p><p>To do so, you need to host an image on your server and display it via Markdown syntax:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>image</span> <span>title</span><span>](</span><span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//rushter.com/counter.svg)</span>
</pre></div><p>On the server-side, each image request can be treated as a view of your profile. The rest of the story is simple — you need to store a counter in the database and return an SVG image with the number of views as a response. Of course, there will be some extra requests from bots, but having such statistics is better than nothing.</p><p>To prevent IP and User Agent leaking, GitHub caches all images via special proxy. To avoid being cached on Github servers after the first image request, your image must specify cache headers or return non-200 response (e.g., an HTTP 404 page).</p><p>Here is the HTTP header that disables caching:</p><div><pre><span></span>Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
</pre></div><p>This is not something new for repositories since they had this ability for a long time, and GitHub allows this kind of use of images for <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges#github-repo-hit-counter-">interactive badges</a>. Unlike profiles, repositories have access to traffic statistics too.</p><p>Here is how it can <a href="https://github.com/rushter">look like</a> when you have access to the new feature:</p><p><img alt="Python reference count graph" src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/github_counter.png" width="700"></p><p><br> There are libraries and services that can do <a href="https://github.com/brentvollebregt/hit-counter">this for you</a>. You can also use <a href="https://pipedream.com/@tod/github-profile-view-counter-p_G6CNmN/readme">Pipedream</a> if you want to have more control over the counter logic.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p>For a lot of people, allowing external images on their websites sounds like not a big deal. I've been using this technique to track profiles views on various platforms for more than 10 years. I've seen how recruiters constantly refresh my profiles when they need to make a decision :).</p><p>Unlike GitHub, most of them don't even bother proxying the image to hide IP, referrer, and browser agent. If you want to allow external images on your site, you <strong>must</strong> proxy them and hide everything about a person who requested it.</p><p>A person with bad intentions can trick a victim into opening your profile that looks completely legit and detect his IP and a browser. You can also set a cookie to track user visits on other websites, but browsers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox">will soon stop</a> doing it.</p><p>A single-pixel image can provide you a lot of information. This is how the whole AD industry works when it tracks your visits on various websites.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>According to my tests, profile views do not count as repo views, and I hope, in the future, we will be able to see traffic stats in the repository that hosts the README file.</p></div></div>]]>

But, once you have a method, often the answer can be verified quickly and the method can be learned easily. Pythagoras needed to be smart to invent his theorem, but now children learn it in school. Other Math Hard things include recipes, designs, and new ideas.</p><p>Unless Pythagoras could have kept his method a secret, which is difficult to do, his theorem wouldn’t have helped him build a defensible company. Even school kids can copy it.</p><p>This is like startup ideas for a new kind of user experience or interface – they’re hard to figure out, hard to keep secret (especially if your users experience the secret), and easy to copy.</p><p>But what if you could keep the secret? After all, ‘trade secrets’ can be kept for a while if you’re careful.</p><p>The problem is, the more success you have with your secret, the more effort other people will put in to discover it. You might be really smart, and have worked really hard, but there are lots of smart people who will work hard to be successful. It’s unrealistic to think that you’ll ever have a totally unique insight, let alone one other people couldn’t come up with if they really wanted to.</p><p>If this kind of insight were the defensibility criterion necessary for starting a successful company, by definition almost no-one would ever start one. No matter the ingenuity of your invention, you’re going to end up competing on some other dimension.</p><p>Math Hardness, the hardness of working stuff out, at best buys you time. How much time? Sadly, some amount of time that’s inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The more valuable your secret turns out to be, the less time you have left.</p><p>The other kind of hardness is the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Some things are difficult to do, even if everyone knows how to do them. This is Bodybuilding Hard.</p><p>Achieving a bodybuilder’s physique isn’t complicated, no matter what the endless range of supplements suggests. You need to: exercise frequently with heavy weights; and consistently eat a protein rich diet. Neither is a secret or complicated to understand. Most people, in shape or not, know this stuff. The problem is that doing these things is intrinsically hard. It requires strenuous activity that’s much less fun than seeing friends over beers and burgers.</p><p>Most valuable achievements are Bodybuilding Hard. Learning a new skill, becoming wealthy, being a good partner – all require effort. Practically everyone knows more or less how to achieve these things, but few actually do. That’s why there is a supplement shortcut for every industry: pointy guitars; self help books; and magazines with fancy bedroom techniques.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hard startups are everywhere. On demand services, marketplaces, ecommerce – they’re the backbone of Rocket Internet’s portfolio. They don’t have Pythagorean secrets. These businesses are a pain to run, requiring the coordination of thousands of people and complex operations.</p><p>Without a secret, beating everyone else is hard. But bodybuilding isn’t economically self-sustaining&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;just&nbsp;good: you need to be the best. Despite small differences, the winner still takes it all.</p><p>Hence, bodybuilding is riddled with steroids and techniques to eek out tiny advantages. Bodybuilding startups are no different — only their steroids are cash, experience, and thousands of traumatised former bankers and consultants.</p><p>The more success you have through doing something Bodybuilding Hard, the more people are going to be incentivised to try to do the same thing. If it’s a startup worth starting, eventually the payoff must outweigh the hardness. And once it’s clear it does, your competition will bring steroids.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hardness, like Math Hardness, buys you time. How much time? Once again, some amount of time inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The better it’s going, the less time you have left.</p><p>Both types of hardness are good ways to get started. Doing something hard buys you a window of opportunity to succeed. But, once you’re big, something else has to keep you there.</p><p>Defensibility doesn’t imply hardness in the long run, even if hardness is useful in the beginning. For the best companies, things get easier after the hard part.</p><p>Their long term advantage doesn’t require new insights or ongoing effort: it’s too hard to compete like this once the stakes are high enough. Their advantage is unique resource accumulation – like Google’s datasets or Apple’s brand, or scale-enabled product differentiation – like Uber’s liquidity or Amazon’s delivery infrastructure. You need to snowball.</p><p>Doing something hard can put you ahead of your competition, but it isn’t the hardness that will keep you there.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553598693305_327084"><div><p>Thanks to the EF team for reading drafts of this.

<p>The importance of testing in modern software development is really hard to overstate. Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync_ForKyiv_ReturnsCorrectSolarTimes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        
        <span>var</span> location <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Location</span><span>(</span><span>50.45</span><span>,</span> <span>30.52</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>var</span> date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>DateTimeOffset</span><span>(</span><span>2019</span><span>,</span> <span>11</span><span>,</span> <span>04</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>,</span> TimeSpan<span>.</span><span>FromHours</span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> expectedSolarTimes <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarTimes</span><span>(</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>06</span><span>,</span> <span>55</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            <span>new</span> <span>TimeSpan</span><span>(</span><span>16</span><span>,</span> <span>29</span><span>,</span> <span>00</span><span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> locationProvider <span>=</span> Mock<span>.</span><span><span>Of</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ILocationProvider</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span>lp <span>=&gt;</span>
            lp<span>.</span><span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> Task<span>.</span><span>FromResult</span><span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
        <span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>var</span> solarCalculator <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span>locationProvider<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        <span>var</span> solarTimes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> solarCalculator<span>.</span><span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        
        solarTimes<span>.</span><span>Should</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>BeEquivalentTo</span><span>(</span>expectedSolarTimes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>

https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

July 8, 2020 | https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>
