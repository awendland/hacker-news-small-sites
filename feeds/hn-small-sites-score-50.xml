<p><span>Elroy is a table lamp with a unique feature — the shade can dynamically change, at the swipe of a finger, to a new style or pattern to complement your mood, the time of day, or an event, all from your phone or web browser.</span></p>
<p><span>Elroy is a concept and personal DIY project. I’ll share some learnings and details on how I built it. These aren’t step-by-step instructions, but I hope they’ll be helpful to anyone that’s inspired to build their own design.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/elroy-lamp-4c_moment-5/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><span>Elroy is essentially a computer with a 4-way display, backlit by a bright LED bulb. The four sides of the lamp shade are made from translucent LCD displays, and acrylic and paper diffusion layers. The light source is a very bright 35W LED bulb. The displays are driven by a single board computer running Linux and custom software to display and manage images. The lamp is controllable over wifi via a simple web app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Translucent LCDs</strong></h3>
<p><span>I salvaged some 13” LCD displays from old laptops and found additional matching displays on ebay. I disassembled each display, removing the frame, backing layer, diffusion film, and backlight. This took some practice to get right. The LCD glass is quite fragile. I broke 2 panels during disassembly and had to find replacements. The trick is to remove the electrical tape that holds the display together without flexing the LCD glass so much that it cracks.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-712"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184217-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184217-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184217-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184217-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-712">What’s inside? From top: 1) A shiny white paper layer to reflect the back light 2) a transparent polycarbonate sheet with a film to scatter the back light 3) a stack of different diffusion films 4) metal frame 5) the LCD glass panel with circuit board.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-711"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-711">The backlight is a row of super bright LEDs tucked into a channel in the metal frame. Some other LCD panels use a cold florescent tube instead of LEDs.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The remaining LCD panel is translucent: LCD displays are a sandwich of transparent glass embedded with liquid crystals and tiny transistors, surrounded by layers of polarizing film. In the photo below, I wrote a message on a piece of letter paper, placed it on a clear piece of acrylic, on top of a bright backlight. You can see the LCD display on the right is translucent, but similar to a pair of sunglasses, the polarizing film only permits a fraction of the backlight to emit through the panel.</span></p>

<p><span>Polarizing film is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"><span>necessary for the function of an LCD display</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lamp Light &amp; Diffusion</strong></h3>
<p><span>Given the low amount of light emitted through the display, to create a sufficiently bright lamp, a very bright light source is needed. Also, though an LCD display is typically backlit by a light with a cold color temperature (around 5000K), lamp light is typically a warm color temperature (like 2700K). So the ideal bulb must be bright and warm.</span></p>

<figure id="attachment_713" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-713"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_165342-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_165342-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_165342-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_165342-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-713">The gigantic 9″ long 35W LED bulb I chose beside an ordinary LED lamp bulb.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>I experimented with multi-bulb arrays, and different bulb options, but settled on this 35W (300W equiv) LED bulb. This bulb is giant and takes up quite a bit of space within the shade. It’s bright enough that it shouldn’t be directly exposed — it would be uncomfortable (maybe dangerous?) to look at directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, without some work, the light from the bulb, when viewed through the LCD panels, would be a harsh point-light concentrated in the center. </span><span>I wanted to diffuse the light evenly across the surface and produce a textured, fabric-like aesthetic. I experimented with different acrylic and polycarbonate sheets and paper materials.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_688" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-688"><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/img_20190523_214720/" rel="attachment wp-att-688"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190523_214720-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190523_214720-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190523_214720-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190523_214720-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-688">Diffusion through mulberry paper.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Here’s one experiment result I really liked, but didn’t end up using. This is mulberry paper, which has a unique texture that’s simultaneously woody and linen-like, has nice diffusion properties, and transmits a lot of light. This looked great with black and white patterns and particularly complemented a Japanese lantern aesthetic. I felt like the large and non-uniform fibers didn’t work as well with a diverse set of patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>I found the best combination was this sandwich (starting from the inside):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Frosted acrylic 1/8″ 90% emission (film facing out)</span></li>
<li><span>Vellum tracing paper</span></li>
<li><span>LCD</span></li>
<li><span>Rice paper</span></li>
<li><span>Clear anti-glare polycarbonate 3/32”</span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_700" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-700"><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/elroy-lamp-4c_moment-2a/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-2a-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-2a-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-2a-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-2a-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-2a.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-700">Close up of lamp where texture is visible.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The acrylic and polycarbonate sheets also add some structure to protect the LCD glass from flexing and breaking. I wrapped the edges of each sandwich in acetate cloth electrical tape to keep the sheets together.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Controlling</strong></h3>
<p><span>I needed a small SBC (single-board computer), capable of driving 4 displays. I happened to have an Nvidia Jetson Nano, which has DisplayPort 1.2 output with support for MST (multi-stream transport), which means it’s able to drive multiple displays. The Jetson Nano is a powerful, tiny computer that operates on 5V power and can run a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.</span></p>

<p><span>I wrote some custom software based on </span><a href="https://www.pygame.org/"><span>Pygame</span></a><span> to display images, with a simple web app and server to give me control over the images.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="409" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg 294w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-768x785.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-1002x1024.jpg 1002w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p><span>The LCD panels take EDP (Embedded DisplayPort) video input. Each display required an adapter from DisplayPort to EDP. These adapters are bulky and have a lot of functionality I didn’t actually need, like 12V power and brightness control for a backlight (which I removed from each panel) and a control interface for display settings. I also needed an MST Hub to break out 4 DP ports from the 1 DP port on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. This configuration is something I think I could make cheaper and more compact in a future revision, but it worked great for this concept.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Woodwork</strong></h3>
<p><span>I designed the lamp structure in Rhino3D and chose to make wooden parts from walnut. This makes the shade rather heavy, but the lamp is stable with the walnut base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692"><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/img_20190608_172549/" rel="attachment wp-att-692"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-692">The shade frame, glued-up, sanded, and ready to stain.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>I cut all parts for the shade and base, then shaped them on a router table. I’m not an experienced woodworker, but this came together pretty easily. I had an adventure making tongue-and-groove joints for the first time. This is the 3rd time I’ve used walnut for a project and I always like the result.</span></p>
<p><span>The side-edges of the frame have brass threaded inserts that enable the top and bottom to attach via M2 machine screws.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3D Printed Parts</strong></h3>
<p><span>Most of the electronic components, including the power supply, SBC, MST Hub, switches, and wiring are mounted in a 4.5” square 3D printed “sleeve” that fits inside the walnut base. There is also a vented platform that connects the sleeve to the bottom of the shade.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_696" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-696"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-1024x780.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="400" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-1024x780.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-768x585.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform.jpg 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-696">Drawing of sleeve and vented platform.

<figure id="attachment_716" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-716"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-716">The sleeve, ready to insert into the walnut base. I primed and painted the 3D printed sleeve. Only the top 2 inches is visible when the lamp is assembled, so the rough spots here aren’t a problem.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>If I were building this lamp for production … or if I had access to the right tools, I’d want to make the sleeve and platform out of sheet metal to improve heat dissipation.</span></p>
<p><span>On top of the shade, I added a louvered cover. This enables the shade to emit additional light from the top, while obscuring the bulb, which is too bright to look at directly. This also permits heat to escape. I printed these parts out of translucent PETG, which has a higher plasticization temperature than some other common 3D printing filament materials.

<h3><strong>Making it better</strong></h3>
<p><span>This lamp is mostly a proof of concept, but it works and looks good enough that I plan to keep it and use it. If I make another, I have a few ideas for improvement.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sheet metal. Replace the 3D printed sleeve and vented platform with sheet metal to help dissipate heat.</span></li>
<li><span>Replace the DisplayPort MST hub and adapters. These take up a lot of space and add significant expense (~$250 for the hub and 4 adapters). One theoretical alternative is a DisplayLink adapter based on the </span><a href="https://www.displaylink.com/integrated-chipsets/dl-4000"><span>DL-4100</span></a><span>, which would drive displays over USB and support EDP. I haven’t been able to find such a device on the market yet. Another option to drive displays from USB3 would be to use an SBC with Displayport Alt Mode. I would still need to adapt Displayport to eDP. Adapter boards that do this are bulky and have a lot of components because they provide power and control to the backlight. Since I’m not using a backlight, I could make a simpler adapter that just maps pins for the different connectors.</span></li>
<li><span>Finally, reconsider the closed frame design. Elroy’s shade is basically a closed box. I made this choice&nbsp; to obscure the bulb and hide some electronic components like the EDP ribbon cables and adapters. An open frame design might be possible. One idea is to backlight the panels with edge lighting so I can reduce or eliminate the high wattage bulb.</span></li>

<p>This week, we close out our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, although I ought to note that there will be at least one addendum discussing pre-modern cast iron and crucible steel (Wootz) production.  Last week, we looked at the processes used to create steel from iron by introducing carbon (rather than the modern method of producing steel from pig iron by <em>removing</em> carbon).  That process changes the characteristics of the metal, since steel is harder and more elastic (bending and springing back, rather than bending and staying bent) than iron.</p>



<p>But the chemical composition of the iron or steel isn’t the only factor in determining its hardness and ductility: mechanical processes and heat treatment also alter the internal structure of the metal.  Since the pre-modern blacksmith works with both of these – mechanical processes through hammer and heat through the ‘heats’ of forging – he cannot afford to disregard the changes that both bring.  As we noted in part III, the blacksmith’s job is not merely to bring the metal into the necessary <em>shape</em> for its final application, he also has to get it there with the right <em>characteristics</em> – the correct balance of hardness, strength, ductility and elasticity to get the job done, whatever that job might be.</p>



<p>And I should note again that different tools – and indeed, different parts of the same tool – might have very different demands in this regard.  Metal files needed to be prodigiously hard so that they could abrade already quite hard materials.  The tips of chisels and picks also needed to be very hard, to keep their shape under repeated impacts, but not so hard that they broke; some ductility to absorb the energy of impact was needed.  Armor needed typically to only be somewhat hardened (though demands of this sort get higher with gunpowder) and can be fairly malleable; the armor plate that deforms elastically on impact still absorbs the strike.  Swords made varied demands: their significant length demanded strong steel with good elasticity to be able to spring back into proper shape after absorbing the forces of swings and impacts, while keeping a good cutting edge demanded a high degree of hardness (hardness being the characteristic that determines how sharp an edge can be and also how well that sharpness can be held during use).</p>



<p>So a blacksmith couldn’t simply maximize one trait at the expense of the others. Nor could they have just one kind of steel, with just one set of characteristics for every application.  Rather the learned techniques – copied and practiced during their apprenticeship – were developed, probably over generations, by experimentation to produce tools, weapons and armor each with its own unique ‘right blend’ of characteristics, though two major methods we will discuss today (along with, of course, carbon content, which we discussed last week).</p>

<h2>Work Hardening</h2>



<p><strong>Work hardening</strong> refers to the tendency of metals, when hammered (or strained into any kind of plastic deformation) to become harder.  In its pristine state, the atoms of a metal are generally arranged in a crystal structure, joined by metallic bonds.  These lattices of atoms are neat and regular.  When that neat, regular lattice of atoms is strained, resulting in plastic (rather than elastic) deformation, those neat regular lattices get scrunched and bent and otherwise dislocated.  This happens in iron, but also in most metals – indeed, work hardening is <em>much more</em> important in bronze-work than it is in iron-work, though it cannot be neglected in either.</p>



<p>That dislocation makes the metal resistant to further deformation (plastic <em>or</em> elastic), both increasing the hardness of the metal and its yield strength (the amount of energy you need to apply for plastic, rather than elastic deformation to take place), but at the same time makes the metal less malleable and more brittle (that is, more likely to break than bend).  This is a property that must have been apparent to the earliest copper-smiths: as they hammered their copper into shape, each blow made the metal slightly more resistant to hammering, until eventually it would refuse to budge almost completely (and possibly break instead).  But the same process works for iron, though because of the different production process for iron, it has to be a touch more intentional.</p>



<p>It is possible to reset this process through a process called <strong>annealing</strong>.  When a work hardened metal is heated up, the energy provided by the heat allows the atoms to break and reform their bonds, causing the crystal structure to return to its normal lattice and removing the various dislocations (while retaining its new shape).  To completely anneal iron, it is heated up to its annealing temperature (which varies based on the carbon content, as you can see in the chart below) and held there for an extended period, which will cause it to get a soft as possible for the given iron and carbon content.  This can be very handy if the iron needs to be cold worked (see below).</p>

<p>If the iron is not held at the high temperature, but is allowed to cool slowly in the air, it is said to be <em>normalized</em> (this process, <em><strong>normalization</strong></em>, is a subset of annealing).  As with full annealing, the heating process works out all of the little strains in metal (heats for this process range from 700 to 900°C), but by cooling it slowly afterwards (rather than holding it at a high temperature), it causes the actual size of the atomic lattice of the metal to shrink (the technical term is ‘grain refinement’ as the individual grains of the lattice are ‘refined’ – meaning ‘get smaller’), which results in a metal <em>somewhat</em> harder than in a fully annealed state.  Normalization is an important step for metal that is going to be subsequently heat treated as well.</p>



<p>Now the attentive reader will be thinking, “but wait, if heating the metal up to forging heat and letting it cool in the air resets the work hardening process – well, we’re doing that every time we heat the metal for forging.”  Indeed!  <strong>Hot</strong> <strong>working </strong>(which is what we’ve been describing so far with forging) generally does not meaningfully work harden metal for this very reason.  And for a smith working with good steel that is going to be <em>heat treated</em> (which we’ll discuss in a minute) this doesn’t matter a whole lot.  </p>



<p>But – for reasons which we’ll discuss – iron with very low carbon contents <em>cannot</em> be heat treated for hardness.  <strong>For a smith working with nearly pure (no carbon) iron, work hardening is his best option for increasing hardness and yield strength.</strong>  In this case, the iron object would typically be brought essentially to its final shape and then finished by being hammered <em>cold</em> (‘<strong>cold working</strong>‘).  While copper and bronze are generally soft enough to be almost entirely cold worked, iron really isn’t, except in fairly thin sheets, so the bulk of the actual <em>shaping</em> will still be done with hot forging, but with a final phase of cold hammering which will induce work hardening (and also, incidentally, can remove tool marks from the hot working, which might be cosmetically desirable).</p>



<h2>Heat Treatment Basics</h2>



<p>The changes steel undergoes when it is heated and cools can also alter its characteristics.  Because, as we’ll see, a big part of the effect of heat treatment has to do with the carbon atoms diffused within the crystalline iron structure of steel, pure iron and low carbon steel cannot be effectively heat treated and has to instead be work hardened in order to achieve similar results.  Heat treatment allows the blacksmith fairly fine control over the hardness, strength and ductility of the steel and can even allow for different parts of a single steel object to be hardened to different degrees.</p>



<p>For high-carbon steel, the heat treatment cycle is often called ‘tempering and quenching’ although as we’ll see it would perhaps be more accurate to call the process <em><strong>hardening, quenching and tempering</strong></em> (and then quenching one more time) to get the correct order.  It is something of an irony that first, intense <em>quenching</em> of raw, red-hot steel (the second quenching is much less dramatic as it occurs at much lower temperatures) – almost always shown as the <em>final</em> step in blacksmithing in film or video games – is essentially never the final step, for reasons that will soon become apparent.</p>



<p>First, some complicated metallurgy and then we’ll get to the actual real world processes a blacksmith would use.  High carbon steel is initially a mix of two kinds of iron, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_iron"><strong>ferrite</strong> </a>and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite">cementite</a></strong>, the former being a cubic atomic structure of pure iron, whereas the later is an iron-carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C for the curious).  If that steel is heated above 912°C (but not melted), something interesting starts to happen: the ferrite structure changes into <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenite">austenite</a></strong>.  Avoiding the deep weeds of metallurgy here, all we need to know is that austenite is a <em>different</em> cube of iron that is able to absorb carbon atoms, pulling them out of the cementite and trapping them inside the individual austentite structures.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language select-able on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>There have been three versions of UNIX. The earliest version (circa 1969–70) ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers. The second version ran on the unprotected PDP-11/20 computer. This paper describes only the PDP-11/40 and /45 [l] system since it is more modern and many of the differences between it and older UNIX systems result from redesign of features found to be deficient or lacking.</p>

<p>Since PDP-11 UNIX became operational in February 1971, about 40 installations have been put into service; they are generally smaller than the system described here. Most of them are engaged in applications such as the preparation and formatting of patent applications and other textual material, the collection and processing of trouble data from various switching machines within the Bell System, and recording and checking telephone service orders. Our own installation is used mainly for research in operating systems, languages, computer networks, and other topics in computer science, and also for document preparation.</p>

<p>Perhaps <mark>the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort</mark>: UNIX can run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and less than two man years were spent on the main system software. Yet UNIX contains a number of features seldom offered even in much larger systems. <mark>It is hoped, however, the users of UNIX will find that the most important characteristics of the system are its simplicity, elegance, and ease of use.</mark></p>

<p>Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED[2], linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL[3] with types and structures (C), interpreter for a dialect of BASIC, text formatting program, Fortran compiler, Snobol interpreter, top-down compiler-compiler (TMG) [4], bottom-up compiler-compiler (YACC), form letter generator, macro processor (M6) [5], and permuted index program.</p>

<p>There is also a host of maintenance, utility, recreation, and novelty programs. All of these programs were written locally. It is worth noting that the system is totally self-supporting. All UNIX software is maintained under UNIX; likewise, UNIX documents are generated and formatted by the UNIX editor and text formatting program.</p>

<h2 id="2-hardware-and-software-environment">2. Hardware and Software Environment</h2>

<p>The PDP-11/45 on which our UNIX installation is implemented is a 16-bit word (8-bit byte) computer with 144 Kbytes of core memory; UNIX occupies 42K bytes. This system, however, includes a very large number of device drivers and enjoys a generous allotment of space for I/O buffers and system tables; a minimal system capable of running the software mentioned above can require as little as 50K bytes of core altogether.</p>

<p>The PDP-11 has a 1M byte fixed-head disk, used for filesystem storage and swapping, four moving-head disk drives which each provide 2.5M bytes on removable disk cartridges, and a single moving-head disk drive which uses removable 40M byte disk packs. There are also a high-speed paper tape reader-punch, nine-track magnetic tape,and D-tape (a variety of magnetic tape facility in which individual records may be addressed and rewritten). Besides the console typewriter, there are 14 variable-speed communications interfaces attached to 100-series datasets and a 201 dataset interface used primarily for spooling printout to a communal line printer. There are also several one-of-a-kind devices including a Picturephone® interface,a voice response unit, a voice synthesizer, a phototypesetter, a digital switching network, and a satellite PDP-11/20 which generates vectors, curves, and characters on a Tektronix 611 storage-tube display.</p>

<p>The greater part of UNIX software is written in the above-mentioned C language [6]. Early versions of the operating system were written in assembly language, but during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C. The size of the new system is about one third greater than the old. Since the new system is not only much easier to understand and to modify but also includes many functional improvements, including multiprogramming and the ability to share reentrant code among several user programs, we considered this increase in size quite acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-file-system">3. The File System</h2>

<p><span>
 S: Note how the paper considers files important. Unix exposes all the functionality through files.
</span></p>

<p>The most important job of UNIX is to provide a file system. From the point of view of the user, there are three kinds of files: ordinary disk files, directories, and special files</p>

<h3 id="31-ordinary-files">3.1 Ordinary Files</h3>

<p><mark>A file contains whatever information the user places on it, for example symbolic or binary (object) programs. No particular structuring is expected by the system.</mark> Files of text consist simply of a string of characters, with lines demarcated by the new-line character. Binary programs are sequences of words as they will appear in core memory when the program starts executing. A few user programs manipulate files with more structure: the assembler generates and the loader expects an object file in a particular format. However, the structure of files is controlled by the programs which use them, not by the system.</p>

<h3 id="32-directories">3.2 Directories</h3>

<p><mark>Directories provide the mapping between the names of files and the files themselves, and thus induce a structure on the file system as a whole.</mark> Each user has a directory of his own files; he may also create subdirectories to contain groups of files conveniently treated together. A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it cannot be written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system controls the contents of directories. However, anyone with appropriate permission may read a directory just like any other file.</p>

<p>The system maintains several directories for its own use. One of these is the <em>root</em> directory. All files in the system can be found by tracing a path through a chain of directories until the desired file is reached. The starting point for such searches is often the root. Another system directory contains all the programs provided for general use; that is, all the <em>commands</em>. As will be seen however, it is by no means necessary that a program reside in this directory for it to be executed.</p>

<p><span>
 S: This is a succinct description of path system of unix and Linux
</span></p>

<p>Files are named by sequences of 14 or fewer characters. When the name of a file is specified to the system, it may be in the form of a <em>path name</em>, which is a sequence of directory names separated by slashes <code>/</code> and ending in a file name. If the sequence begins with a slash, the search begins in the root directory. The name <code>/alpha/beta/gamma</code> causes the system to search the root for directory <code>alpha</code>, then to search <code>alpha</code> for <code>beta</code>, finally to find <code>gamma</code> in <code>beta</code>. <code>gamma</code> may be an ordinary file, a directory, or a special file. As a limiting case, the name <code>/</code> refers to the root itself.</p>

<p>A path name not starting with <code>/</code> causes the system to begin the search in the user’s current directory. Thus, the name <code>alpha/beta</code> specifies the file named <code>beta</code> in subdirectory <code>alpha</code> of the current directory. The simplest kind of name, for example <code>alpha</code>, refers to a file which itself is found in the current directory. As another limiting case, the null file name refers to the current directory.</p>

<p>The same nondirectory file may appear in several directories under possibly different names. This feature is called <em>linking</em>; a directory entry for a file is sometimes called a link. <mark>UNIX differs from other systems in which linking is permitted in that all links to a file have equal status.</mark> That is, a file does not exist within a particular directory; the directory entry for a file consists merely of its name and a pointer to the information actually describing the file. Thus a file exists independently of any directory entry, although in practice a file is made to disappear along with the last link to it.</p>

<p>Each directory always has at least two entries. The name in each directory refers to the directory itself. Thus a program may read the current directory under the name <code>.</code> without knowing its complete path name. The name <code>..</code> by convention refers to the parent of the directory in which it appears, that is, to the directory in which it was created.</p>

<p><mark>The directory structure is constrained to have the form of a rooted tree.</mark> Except for the special entries <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>, each directory must appear as an entry in exactly one other,which is its parent. Te reason for this is to simplify the writing of programs which visit subtrees of the directory structure, and more important, to avoid the separation of portions of the hierarchy. If arbitrary links to directories were permitted, it would be quite difficult to detect when the last connection from the root to a directory was severed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>We live in times of great disaggregation, and yet, seem to learn increasingly from generalists.</p>
<p>In the past, an expert in one field of Psychology might have been forced to teach a broad survey class. Today, you could have each lecture delivered by the world’s leading expert.</p>
<p>Outside of academia, you might follow one writer’s account to learn about SaaS pricing, another to understand the intricacies of the electoral college, and yet another to understand personal finance. In economic terms, content disaggregation enabled by digital platforms ought to create efficiencies through intellectual hyper-specialization.</p>
<p>Instead, we have the endless hellscape of the casual polymath. A newsletter about venture capital will find time to opine on herd immunity. The tech blog you visit to learn about data science is also your source of financial strategies for early retirement. The Twitter account you followed to understand politics now seems more focused on their mindfulness practice. We have maxed out variety of interests within people, at the cost of diversity across them.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to imagine how this happened. The flip side of disaggregation is that each would-be expert is able to read broadly as well. The world of atomized content through hyper-specialization isn’t a stable equilibrium. We are all casual polymaths now.</p>
<p>As romantic as the idea seems, I worry it’s grossly suboptimal. Sure, there are cases where combining ideas from disparate fields can lead to new insight, but today’s generalists are not curating a portfolio of skills so much as they are stumbling about. <strong>Behavioral Econ is the love child of economics and psychology, early AI researchers maintained a serious interest in cognitive science. What exactly are your cursory interests in space exploration, meta-science and bayesian statistics preparing you for?</strong></p>
<p>I understand that we can sometimes only “connect the dots looking backwards”. Perhaps there is valuable work in a statistical meta-analysis of aerospace research. But that’s only true if you’re going into some degree of depth in each field.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to dissuade you from becoming a polymath, just to be a little more distrustful of others who claim to be.</p>
<h4 id="1-Polymaths-use-status-in-one-field-to-gain-capital-in-another"><a href="#1-Polymaths-use-status-in-one-field-to-gain-capital-in-another" title="1. Polymaths use status in one field to gain capital in another"></a>1. Polymaths use status in one field to gain capital in another</h4><p>In 1947, with financial support from his father, JFK won a seat in the US House of Representatives with no political experience. As his father would later remark: “With the money I spent, I could have elected my chauffeur.”</p>
<p>If you saw JFK in 1947, you might have thought “wow, he’s rich, his father was the Chairman of the SEC, and he’s a member of the US House of Representatives, what an impressive guy!” A decade later, you could have added “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage">Pulitzer Prize winning author</a>“ to that list.</p>
<p>But this reasoning is totally backwards. JFK was only able to become a politician because of his wealth. In fact, his father only became SEC Chairman after extensive political donations to FDR. And obviously, his book was ghost-written by his speechwriter.</p>
<p>So you’re justified in being impressed by exactly one accomplishment, and everything else ought to be discounted.</p>
<p>We already understand this intuitively, but only in a limited set of cases. If a pop star becomes an actor, we are not impressed by their wide range of talents. Instead, we understand that popularity is a semi-fungible good.</p>
<h4 id="2-Polymaths-are-abusing-Gell-Mann-Amnesia"><a href="#2-Polymaths-are-abusing-Gell-Mann-Amnesia" title="2. Polymaths are abusing Gell-Mann Amnesia"></a>2. Polymaths are abusing Gell-Mann Amnesia</h4><p>As I wrote <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/17/markets-nasa/">earlier</a>:<br><em>You go on Twitter, you read someone’s tweet on a subject you know something about, and see that the author has no understanding of the facts. So you keep scrolling and read their tweets about cancel culture, space exploration and criminal justice reform, totally forgetting how wrong they were before.</em></p>
<p><em>In this sense, every tweet is an option with asymmetric returns. If you’re right, you cash out; if you’re wrong, everyone forgets and you lose nothing. The incentive is to ramp up variance, make bold claims in a variety of areas, and hope you’re right some of the time.</em></p>
<p>Accordingly, authors will make bold claims in a variety of areas, and you may be inclined to believe them even after seeing how wrong they are. Unless you are also a polymath, and a polymath in the same domains, you will probably not be capable of evaluating their competence.</p>
<p>Of course, you might rely on external opinions, which brings us to the last point.</p>
<h4 id="3-Polymaths-are-evaluated-by-non-polymaths"><a href="#3-Polymaths-are-evaluated-by-non-polymaths" title="3. Polymaths are evaluated by non-polymaths"></a>3. Polymaths are evaluated by non-polymaths</h4><p>Leonardo da Vinci is the most famous polymath of all time and the model omni-competent Renaissance Man.</p>
<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci also didn’t know math.</strong> Issacson’s book details numerous episodes in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leonardo comes up with a million dollar business idea, later realizes his basic arithmetic was off by more than an order of magnitude.</li>
<li>Leonardo claims to be a military engineer to gain acceptance at the Milanese court. In fact, he has never built any kind of weapon or siege device.</li>
<li>Leonardo claims to have solved the ancient puzzle of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube">doubling the cube</a>. Except his “solution” only works if you can’t tell the difference between the square root of 3 and cube root of 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last example is especially notable because Issacson himself doesn’t seem to catch it, instead uncritically praising Leonardo’s discovery. [Details in Appendix]</p>
<p>And yet <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Wikipedia writes</a>:<br><em>…many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the “Renaissance Man” or “Universal Genius”, an individual of “unquenchable curiosity” and “feverishly inventive imagination.”[6] He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived.[10] According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history</em></p>
<p>Of course <strong>the inflation of his mathematical and engineering ability makes sense when you consider the that judges in question are predominantly art historians</strong>. Rather than as a Renaissance Man, Leonardo would be better regarded as an exceptional painter with various hobbies.</p>
<hr>
<p>While an expert in one domain may just be a savant with a “kooky knack”, mastering multiple unrelated skills feels like evidence of general intelligence, or in Leonardo’s case, “Universal Genius”. If someone is good at computer science, epidemiology and finance, surely we can trust their opinion on politics as well?</p>
<p>Except what’s really happening is that we’ve chosen to privilege certain combinations of skills as impressive, while taking others for granted.</p>
<p>A physicist who studies math, can write code for analysis and understand complex systems is not hailed as a polymath. They’re just seen as obtaining the basic set of skills required for their profession. Similarly, a basketball player who can run, shoot and block is not any kind of “polymath”.</p>
<p>You might object that this is because physics and basketball are specific clusters of skills. Running quickly is more closely related to throwing a ball than software engineering is to epidemiology.</p>
<p>This might be true in specific cases, but in general, it’s a coincidence of which skills cluster into occupations. A small business owner who manages their own books, handles sales and manufactures their product is not considered a polymath, no matter how distinct those fields might be. Computational social scientists are not considered polymaths, neither is an OnlyFans creator who single handedly runs everything from marketing to modeling, nor a translator who has to master ancient greek, dive deeply into historical context, and also be a great poet in their own right.</p>
<hr>
<p>To be clear, there are still good reasons to learn a variety of skills. As Marc Andreessen <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html">put it</a>:<br><em>All successful CEO’s [sic] are like this. They are almost never the best product visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best finance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25% in some set of those skills, and then all of a sudden they’re qualified to actually run something important.</em></p>
<p>He goes on to provide examples, listing Communication, Management, Sales, Finance and International Experience.</p>
<p>I’m broadly in agreement. Learning these skills will probably benefit your career. Just understand that no one has ever been hailed as a polymath because they’re good at both communication and management. They’re just considered basically competent at their job.</p>
<p>I don’t want to dissuade anyone from learning broadly and reading widely. Of course athletes should cross train, and intellectuals should read outside their domain, and software engineers might benefit from public speaking classes.</p>
<p>My point is that we should not trust or glorify people on the basis of their apparent “Universal Genius”. Having a variety of interests is no more a sign of generalized intelligence than being able to walk and chew gum. And if someone does appear to have accomplishments in a variety of domains with fungible currency, their total status should not be a sum or multiple, but merely the status of their single most impressive feat.</p>
<p>So go read your SaaS/Meta-Science/Aerospace blog and revel in the genuine joy of intellectual curiosity. As Tyler Cowen would say, I’m just here to lower the status of polymaths.</p>
<h2 id="Appendix-Doubling-the-Cube"><a href="#Appendix-Doubling-the-Cube" title="Appendix: Doubling the Cube"></a>Appendix: Doubling the Cube</h2><p>Here’s the full quote from Issacson:<br><em>These obsessions led Leonardo to an ancient riddle described by Vitruvius, Euripides, and others. Faced with a plague in the fifth century BC, the citizens of Delos consulted the oracle of Delphi. They were told that the plague would end if they found a mathematical way to precisely double the size of the altar to Apollo, which was shaped as a cube. When they doubled the length of each side, the plague worsened; the Oracle explained that by doing so they had increased the size of the cube eightfold rather than doubling it. (For example, a cube with two-foot sizes has eight times the volume of a cube with one-foot sides.) To solve the problem geometrically required multiplying the length of each side by the cube root of 2.</em></p>

Those pomo philosoÂ­phers were right all along.</p></li><li><p>StuÂ­pidity doesnâ€™t have stayÂ­ing power, relÂ­aÂ­tive to non-stuÂ­pidity: thereâ€™s a sort of surÂ­vival of the fittest in which vast amounts of exÂ­presÂ­sions are beÂ­ing proÂ­duced all the time, most of which are stupid and fall away, but the ones that arenâ€™t stupid are more likely to surÂ­vive in memÂ­ory and to be mainÂ­tained in the hisÂ­torÂ­iÂ­cal record. This biÂ­ases things to make it apÂ­pear that the proÂ­porÂ­tion of non-stupid exÂ­presÂ­sions was lower in the past than it reÂ­ally was.</p></li><li><p>PoliÂ­tics and conÂ­sumer capÂ­iÂ­talÂ­ism are moÂ­tiÂ­vated to idenÂ­tify and tarÂ­get stupid peoÂ­ple so as to take adÂ­vanÂ­tage of them, so they have creÂ­ated sysÂ­tems that enÂ­courage stupid peoÂ­ple to self-idenÂ­tify and make themÂ­selves promiÂ­nent so that they can be picked off; that Iâ€™m noticÂ­ing this is just a side effect.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>PeoÂ­ple have given up tryÂ­ing to unÂ­derÂ­stand things in this messed-up timeline and are just rolÂ­ling with it; itâ€™s a sort of inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual learned helÂ­plessÂ­ness that apÂ­pears as exÂ­pandÂ­ing stuÂ­pidity.</p></li><li><p>StuÂ­pidity has its fashÂ­ions, and the latÂ­est fashÂ­ions are more in-your-face than they used to be.</p></li><li><p>PharÂ­maÂ­ceuÂ­tiÂ­cals that have beÂ­come popÂ­uÂ­lar in reÂ­cent decades have cogÂ­niÂ­tive side effects that are difficult to meaÂ­sure in the inÂ­diÂ­viÂ­dÂ­ual but cause noÂ­ticeÂ­able effects in the agÂ­greÂ­gate.</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly someÂ­thing in our diet, for exÂ­amÂ­pleâ€¦</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly all that exÂ­tra CO<sub>2</sub> in the atÂ­moÂ­sphere.</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly toxÂ­oÂ­plasÂ­moÂ­sis meow.</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly some other sort of change in our maÂ­teÂ­rial enÂ­viÂ­ronÂ­ment (exÂ­cludÂ­ing culÂ­tural changes).</p></li><li><p>Back in the day, when a perÂ­son had a stupid idea, they would be reÂ­lucÂ­tant to put it forÂ­ward as their own. Rather, they would wait to see if someÂ­one else would voice the idea so they could just agree with it. This used to be relÂ­aÂ­tively rare, but now you just have to google â€œ[my stupid idea]â€� to find that someÂ­one or other has said it first, and then youâ€™re off to the races.</p></li><li><p>If you have a smart idea, you may also be smart enough to reÂ­alÂ­ize that itâ€™s not useÂ­ful right now /â€‹ has already been betÂ­ter said /â€‹ is inÂ­apÂ­proÂ­priÂ­ate in conÂ­text. If you have a dumb idea, such thoughts may be less likely to ocÂ­cur to you due to the aura of dumbth that surÂ­rounds the dumb idea and reÂ­pels senÂ­siÂ­ble conÂ­sidÂ­erÂ­aÂ­tions. Back when exÂ­presÂ­sions of stuÂ­pidity were mostly ephemeral, this didnâ€™t matÂ­ter much, but now that they acÂ­quire inÂ­stant perÂ­maÂ­nence and global reach, they apÂ­pear to swamp evÂ­eryÂ­thing else.</p></li><li><p>Stupid choices used to reÂ­liÂ­ably have unÂ­deÂ­sirÂ­able reÂ­sults; now there is more of a disÂ­conÂ­nect where peoÂ­ple are shielded from the reÂ­sults of their stupid choices, or even reÂ­warded for them (man lights himÂ­self on fire in an easÂ­ily-forseeÂ­able misÂ­adÂ­venÂ­ture, beÂ­comes YouTube legÂ­end). So peoÂ­ple may be apÂ­pearÂ­ing stupid not as a reÂ­sult of beÂ­ing stupid but as the reÂ­sult of a perÂ­verse cost-benefit analÂ­yÂ­sis. PeoÂ­ple are no dumber than they used to be, but for [reaÂ­sons] it has beÂ­come adÂ­vanÂ­taÂ­geous to disÂ­play stuÂ­pidity and so smart peoÂ­ple someÂ­times mimic idiocy so as to reap such adÂ­vanÂ­tages. The smarter they are, the quicker they caught on to this and the betÂ­ter mimics they are, so this makes it look as though the smart peoÂ­ple are beÂ­ing reÂ­placed by moÂ­rons, when reÂ­ally itâ€™s more a matÂ­ter of camÂ­ouÂ­flage.</p></li><li><p>The way we edÂ­uÂ­cate chilÂ­dren went seÂ­riÂ­ously sideÂ­ways a while back, and so, yeah, stupid hapÂ­pened.</p></li><li><p>Newly-popÂ­uÂ­lar meÂ­dia and/â€‹or its conÂ­tent is someÂ­how diÂ­rectly damÂ­agÂ­ing to menÂ­tal facÂ­ulÂ­ties.</p></li><li><p>Changes in meÂ­dia/â€‹comÂ­muÂ­niÂ­caÂ­tions techÂ­nolÂ­ogy alÂ­low stupid peoÂ­ple to be much more promiÂ­nent than they used to be and/â€‹or comÂ­parÂ­aÂ­tively muffle smarter peoÂ­ple.</p></li><li><p>SoÂ­cial meÂ­dia dyÂ­namÂ­ics erode reaÂ­sonÂ­ing and truth-seekÂ­ing while reÂ­wardÂ­ing cogÂ­niÂ­tive biÂ­ases.</p></li><li><p>The news meÂ­dia were doÂ­ing a betÂ­ter job than we reÂ­alÂ­ized in filÂ­terÂ­ing out crap and conÂ­texÂ­tuÂ­alÂ­izÂ­ing new inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gently for us, and as the inÂ­terÂ­net deÂ­stroyed the busiÂ­ness model beÂ­hind inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gent reÂ­portÂ­ing, we failed to come up with a subÂ­stiÂ­tute in time to preÂ­vent idiocy from filling the void and itâ€™s too big a job for inÂ­diÂ­viÂ­dÂ­uÂ­als to do withÂ­out inÂ­stiÂ­tuÂ­tional asÂ­sisÂ­tance.</p></li></ol></div></div>]]>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter whether you're trying to achieve job security; impressing others by showing them how smart you are; or passive aggressively asserting your dominance over a code base, writing unmaintainable code has a number of practical applications. &nbsp;One extremely unmaintainable and bug-ridden technique for C programming involves using both switch statements and statement expressions together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will discuss how you can leverage switch statements and statement expressions to produce C code that is so difficult to understand, you'll need to look at the assembly to figure out what it does. &nbsp;Many of the examples of syntax in this article are not standards compliant or they won't pass even the simplest of static analysis tests. &nbsp;That should be ok though, because writing many of these examples in your company's code base will probably end up getting you fired anyway.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's start by reviewing the humble switch statement that we all know and love:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>int</span> i = ...;
<span>switch</span>(i){
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:{
		...
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:{
		...
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> <span>2</span>:{
		...
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>default</span>:{
		...
	}
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is what most people are used to thinking about when 'switch statements' are mentioned in C. &nbsp;The rough idea is that switch statements are a sort of more appealing alternative to using lots of 'else if' statements when checking for some disjoint property. &nbsp;Some of you may be surprised to learn that the following is also a valid switch statement:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>int</span> i = ...;
<span>switch</span>(i){
        i++;
        <span>default</span>:{ }
        i++;
        <span>case</span> <span>0</span>:{
                <span>case</span> <span>3</span>: i;
        }
        <span>if</span>(i &lt; <span>10</span>){
                <span>case</span> <span>1</span>:{
                        <span>break</span>;
                }
                <span>for</span>(i=<span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++){
                        <span>case</span> <span>2</span>:;
                }
        }
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's worth pointing out that almost no other languages support switch statements the way that they work in C (although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)">D language</a> is an example). &nbsp;Most other languages have a switch statement that works similar to the idea of a more appealing alternative to many 'else if' checks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A switch statement in C would be more appropriately called a 'goto field'. &nbsp;This means that the switch(...) part simply makes a decision about which label to branch to. &nbsp;After branching to that label nothing special happens related to the fact that you're inside a switch statement and the code will just keep executing whatever machine instructions come next. &nbsp;The one exception is, of course, the break statement which will jump to the point after the switch statement body. &nbsp;Here is an equivalent version of the switch statement written above using only ifs and gotos.</p>

<p><code><pre><span>int</span> i = ...;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>0</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_0;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>1</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_1;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>2</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_2;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>3</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_3;

<span>goto</span> label_default;

{
        i++;
        <span>label_default</span>:{ }
        i++;
        <span>label_0</span>:{
                <span>label_3</span>: i;
        }
        <span>if</span>(i &lt; <span>10</span>){
                <span>label_1</span>:{
                        <span>goto</span> break_from_switch;
                }
                <span>for</span>(i=<span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++){
                        <span>label_2</span>:;
                }
        }
}
<span>break_from_switch</span>:
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're already familiar with the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff's device</a> the above this probably isn't news to you:</p>

<p><code><pre>
    <span>int</span> total_bytes = ...;
    <span>int</span> n = (total_bytes + <span>3</span>) / <span>4</span>;
    <span>switch</span> (total_bytes % <span>4</span>) {
            <span>case</span> <span>0</span>: <span>do</span> { *to = *from++;
            <span>case</span> <span>3</span>:      *to = *from++;
            <span>case</span> <span>2</span>:      *to = *from++;
            <span>case</span> <span>1</span>:      *to = *from++;
                    } <span>while</span> (--n &gt; <span>0</span>);
    }
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on Duff's device as inspiration you can use the unique behaviour of switch statements in C to implement coroutines:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>#define coroutine_begin() </span><span>static</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> state=</span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>switch</span><span>(state) { </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>:</span>
<span>#define coroutine_return(x) { state=</span><span>__LINE__</span><span>; </span><span>return</span><span> x; </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>__LINE__</span><span>:; }</span>
<span>#define coroutine_finish() }</span>

<span>int</span> get_next(<span>void</span>) {
        <span>static</span> <span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;
        coroutine_begin();
        <span>while</span> (<span>1</span>){
                coroutine_return(++i);
                coroutine_return(<span>100</span>);
        }
        coroutine_finish();
}

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>1</span>
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>100</span>
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>2</span>
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>100</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example in this section draws on one found in <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">Coroutines in C by Simon Tatham</a>. &nbsp;The original source describes a few caveats of switch based coroutines that I won't discuss in this article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we resolve the macros, and indent the code a bit better, then remove some superfluous brackets and semicolons, the 'get_next' function becomes:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>1234</span><span>4567</span>

<span>int</span> get_next(<span>void</span>) {
        <span>static</span> <span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;
        <span>static</span> <span>int</span> state = <span>0</span>;
	<span>switch</span>(state) {
		<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:;
		<span>while</span>(<span>1</span>){
			state = <span>1234</span>;
			<span>return</span> ++i;
			<span>case</span> <span>1234</span>:;
			state = <span>4567</span>;
			<span>return</span> <span>100</span>;
			<span>case</span> <span>4567</span>:;
		}
        }
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The static variables are key here, because they allow us to communicate information between calls to the function 'get_next'. &nbsp;The switch statement effectively just gives us a convenient way to implement the goto statements that would be necessary to either jump to the start of the coroutine (state = 0), or the point just after the coroutine returns (state = 1234, and state = 4567). &nbsp;If you want to create more return/resume points you can simply add more calls to the 'coroutine_return' macro. &nbsp;You must also make sure that these calls appear between 'coroutine_begin' and 'coroutine_end'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the syntax of the case statements is throwing you off, just remember that</p>

<p><code><pre><span>case</span> <span>0</span>:;
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does same thing as</p>

<p><code><pre><span>case</span> <span>0</span>: {
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first represents a 'statement' with no expression, and the second represents a 'compound statement' with no declarations or expressions. &nbsp;Neither of these forms has a break statement, so execution will always just continue doing whatever is after the case label in the same way that a goto would work.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we've seen how switch statements can get pretty weird, let's explore a few interesting examples of valid switch statement syntax that (depending on how much of a 1337 hacker you are) you may have never seen before:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>);
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	i++;
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
		<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
			<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
				<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
					<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>);
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:;
</pre></code>

<code><pre><span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:
		<span>for</span>(i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++)
			<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:
				<span>for</span>(j = <span>0</span>; j &lt; <span>10</span>; j++)
					<span>case</span> <span>2</span>:
						<span>for</span>(k = <span>0</span>; k &lt; <span>10</span>; k++);
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>){
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:{
		<span>for</span>(i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++){
			<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:{
				<span>while</span>(j){
					<span>case</span> <span>2</span>:{
						<span>for</span>(k = <span>0</span>; k &lt; <span>10</span>; k++){
						}
					}
					j++;
				}
			}
		}
	}<span>case</span> <span>3</span>:{
		
	}<span>default</span>:{
		
	}
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre>


<span>switch</span>(i)
	<span>default</span>: <span>case</span> <span>0</span>: <span>case</span> <span>1</span>: <span>case</span> <span>2</span>: <span>case</span> <span>3</span>:;
</pre></code>

<code><pre>



<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>){
	<span>case</span> UNIQUE_CASE_A:{
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> UNIQUE_CASE_B:{
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> SIMILAR_CASE1: <span>case</span> SIMILAR_CASE2: <span>case</span> SIMILAR_CASE3:{
		<span>break</span>;
	}
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html">Statement expressions</a> are a GNU extension that is not supported by the C standard, but they are supported by default in gcc and clang. &nbsp;They allow you to embed a compound statement within an expression. &nbsp;The value returned by the last expression is the value returned by the entire statement expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;

<span>int</span> j = ({<span>int</span> k; k = i + <span>1</span>; i;}<span>)</span>;
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might ask "Why would you ever want to do such a thing?" &nbsp;There are a number of different answers and many of them are related to convenience: &nbsp;One use case is concerned with ensuring that expression statement side-effects are only evaluated once in the case of a function macro that may cause the expression to appear multiple times in the function macro body.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can stick statement expressions pretty much anywhere you could put a variable:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> get_zero(<span>void</span>){ <span>return</span> <span>0</span>; }

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        <span>0</span><span>9</span>
        <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = ({get_zero();}<span>)</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++<span>)</span>
                printf(<span>"</span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, i);
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can do pretty much anything inside a statement expression that you could do in a regular compound statement:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        <span>0</span><span>99</span>
        <span>int</span> i = ({<span>int</span> j = <span>0</span>; <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>100</span>; i++) j+=i; j;}<span>)</span>;
        printf(<span>"Sum is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, i);
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most of these examples will only compile in clang, since gcc dis-allows branching to a label that is inside a statement expression (which is probably for the best).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's try to embed a switch statement into a switch statement expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(({<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>);<span>3</span>;}<span>))</span>;
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup, this compiles in gcc and clang! &nbsp;This code doesn't do anything interesting, but it illustrates one approach to writing C code that is difficult to read.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's try building a more useful example that combines switch and statement expressions. &nbsp;Here is an example where you want to conditionally change the bounds of a loop. &nbsp;You could use a variable or a function but you could also use a statement expression with embedded case labels!</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>void</span> print_stuff(<span>int</span> type){
        <span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;
        <span>int</span> r = <span>0</span>;
        <span>switch</span>(type){
                <span>for</span>(i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; ({<span>if</span>(<span>0</span>){ <span>case</span> <span>1</span>:r+=<span>2</span>; <span>case</span> <span>0</span>:r+=<span>3</span>;}r;}<span>)</span>; i++<span>)</span>{
                        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, i);
                }
        }
}

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        printf(<span>"First run</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
        print_stuff(<span>0</span>);
        printf(<span>"Second run</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
        print_stuff(<span>1</span>);
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above example gives me the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>First run
i is 0
i is 1
i is 2
Second run
i is 0
i is 1
i is 2
i is 3
i is 4
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you run this program through valgrind you'll find that this it's doing uninitialized reads:</p>

<p><code><pre>==16228== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==16228==    at 0x4005AB: print_stuff (main.c:7)
==16228==    by 0x400619: main (main.c:15)
...
==16228== …</pre></code></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Machine learning and data science code is easy to share but hard to use. GitHub overflows with models, algorithms, and datasets. But code is static. Can you play with the models? See the algorithms? Interact with the data? Doing so requires following complex instructions, installing packages, or reading dense code snippets. Frustrated by this, we decided that <strong>we need a simple, sharable "play" button for machine learning code.</strong></p><p>There are two challenges here. The first is <strong>creating</strong> apps that make data science and machine learning code interactive. The second is <strong>sharing</strong> these apps so that the world can experience your work.</p><p>A year ago, we addressed the first challenge — <strong>creating —</strong> by releasing Streamlit, an open-source library that lets you transform Python scripts into interactive apps. Streamlit lets you easily demonstrate algorithms, play with models, manipulate data, and combine all of these superpowers into beautiful apps. The response has been tremendous. We just crossed our millionth download. Hundreds of thousands of Streamlit apps have been created all over the world. <strong>But creating great apps only solves half the problem.</strong></p><p>Today, we address the second challenge — <strong>sharing</strong> — by announcing a brand-new sharing platform for Streamlit. Streamlit sharing lets you deploy, manage, and share your apps – all for free! If you have a Streamlit app hosted publicly on GitHub, you are now one click away from sharing it with the world. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png 1348w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h2 id="github-and-streamlit-better-together">GitHub and Streamlit - Better Together</h2><p>Streamlit sharing <strong>combines the best of Streamlit with the best of GitHub.</strong> From Streamlit you get a simple framework for creating incredibly rich and useful apps. From GitHub you inherit an incredible framework for social collaboration. Paste your GitHub link into Streamlit's sharing platform and almost instantly you have a live app. Or, click on the menu for any live app and see its source code on GitHub. Collaborate for free simply by forking and editing the code. It’s global, shareable, fork-able, collaborative data science!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/10/filmstrip--6--1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/filmstrip--6--1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/filmstrip--6--1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/filmstrip--6--1.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/filmstrip--6--1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="endless-possibilities">Endless Possibilities</h2><p>Taken together, Streamlit and GitHub enable an <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery">incredibly rich and diverse ecosystem of useful apps</a> – from dashboards to deep nets and beyond! (As former Carnegie Mellon folks, we're especially proud that students taking the <a href="https://dig.cmu.edu/courses/2020-fall-interactive-ds.html">Interactive Data Science</a> class now submit their homework using Streamlit sharing 🤗) Here are some awesome examples of shared Streamlit apps that you can play with right now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--

<h3>HP-28S Battery Compartment Door</h3>
<p>The redesign of the whole HP-28S scientific calculator case is quite difficult and very time consuming. In most cases the only thing broken is the HP-28S battery compartment door, so I decided my first step was to get that re-designed. </p>

<h3>Print testing phase of battery door</h3>
<p>The 3D-print of the HP-28S battery compartment door is being tested right now (05/2020) from a few volunteers. I have reached out to a few 3D designers asking what printing method would be best in making this part. See below for PLA printing picture (not). The answer is Selective Laser Sintering or SLS printing using polyamid (PA). The characteristics are robust and the pegs can be melted down to keep the metal plate or battery contact, in place. <br>Having no experience with 3D printing, I’ve now learned that the following printing methods have certain advantages and disadvantages. </p>
<ul><li>Fused Deposition Modeling or FDM printing</li><li>Stereolithography or SLA printing</li><li>Filament PLA printing (see below)</li></ul>
<p>With FDM printing it is not possible to have the part mechanically resilient. The problem with printing via Stereolithography is with melting the material afterwards. Please find some printing companies <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.teawea.com/3d-print-a-new-hp28s-case/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<h3>Small Assembly of Battery Compartment Door needed</h3>
<p>You should keep your original metal plate from the battery door. After printing the part, you just re-insert the metal plate and melt down the 3 pegs, and voila you have a new battery door.</p>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<ul><li>3D <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.teawea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HPDR-Assembly.pdf" target="_blank">Viewable</a> PDF (Adobe Reader needed)</li><li>After testing the STL file print, I will make it available for download</li></ul>
<h3>PLA printing results</h3>
<p>Feedback from one Tester: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing_filament" target="_blank">PLA</a> filament does not print very well. Adjusted were temperature and speed of print after 3 tries, below pictures show the best it can do. That is the limitation of an entry level 3D printer. <br>Best to use laser type 3D printer, hence SLS printing.</p>

<h3>SLS printing results</h3>
<p>Today June 12th 2020, the first parts arrived and I must say the quality is quite good. I compared the original with the new printed version and I have to make a few adjustments. But now I sourced a printing company close by and progress should be much quicker now.  </p>

<p>Yesterday July 9th 2020, I finally had some time of from work to pick up the 2nd set of printed parts. Very nice quality and the color is just right. The metal plate fits right into the grooves and the 3 pegs are ready to be melted down. Take a look for yourself. I added 2 drops of glue just to be save below the metal plate.</p>

<h3>Ordering and pricing</h3>
<p>I was asked if I had printed a few battery compartment doors and if some could be ordered. So I did some checking on pricing and I ordered 40 of them, which makes sense for that size machine as a minimum order. <br>So if you do NOT want to print them yourself or do not have a SLS printer, you can <a href="https://www.teawea.com/contact-us/">contact me</a> for payment information. <br>Cost €5 a piece + shipping &amp; packaging.  (I would recommend to order 2, so you have a spare)<br>Packaging: €1 (padded envelope)<br>Shipping:  €2 (for 2 parts) within Europe and all other countries<br>As of Oct 2020, I have them available.</p>

  <p>I am a big fan of my Kindle. This is the device I’d bring over to a desert
island. I am also a fairly frequent user of the highlight feature where you can
select a bit of text you like and save it. One thing is bothering me though:
the lack of open API on the Kindle to retrieve the data about me. Amazon
provides the <code>my-clippings.txt</code> file on the Kindle and the “Export my
annotations via e-mail” feature, but both these features cannot be done in the
background automatically, and the last read position is not available. I want
moar !</p>
<p>I want to get the raw data:</p>
<ul>
<li>to print a little book with all my annotations</li>
<li>to retrieve my last read position and see in which periods of my life I tend
to read most (reading less would be a good indicator of stressful periods)</li>
<li>to put the data in my own personal space : my <a href="https://cozy.io/">cozy</a> (I work there).
I could for example randomly display favorite quotes in my Cozy-Home, or
have a “books” app with a public page with all my books. That would be the
digital equivalent of a bookshelf. The bookshelf as a means of sharing good
books that you’ve read is lost with the Kindle. I wish I could easily share
with my friends my reading list. goodreads.com would be another way to do
that, but I’d prefer to have the data at my disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless… but first, I needed to get access to the
data. A long time ago, I tried to access this data via <a href="https://read.kindle.com/">Kindle web</a>
but could not pass the login screen via scraping: there was if I recall
well, credential encryption on the application side, and I had not managed to
redo it correctly.</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen a presentation on using <a href="http://mitm.it/">mitmproxy</a> to discover HTTP
APIs used by apps. It gave me motivation to start again on this project:  this
time, instead of web scraping, I’d try to understand how the Kindle
communicates with Amazon and try to emulate the same HTTP requests to access
my data.</p>
<h2 id="setup-a-man-in-the-middle-on-a-kindle-app">Setup a man in the middle on a Kindle app</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: do not attempt man-in-the-middle attacks on devices or accounts
that are not your own. To successfully conduct this project, you need to have
physical access to the device to install an SSL certificate authority.</p>
<p>To see the flow of communication between an Android device and a remote HTTP
based APIs, things are a bit more involved than from a web browser: in the web
world we have access to the network inspector which helps us record data,
replay calls, see requests and responses, etc… There is no such thing for
Android or iOS. The solution is to do a man-in-the-middle attack on our
device: proxying and recording all traffic through a controlled access point.</p>
<p>The setup is briefly described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Raspberry Pi runs as a wifi access point (through <a href="https://w1.fi/hostapd/">hostapd</a>)</li>
<li>Every packet going through the access point is redirected to mitmproxy (<a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/">in
the transparent mode fashion</a>)</li>
<li>HTTPs man-in-the-middle is made possible thanks to a custom CA authority
installed on the whispersync client device</li>
<li>A real or virtual (for example with <a href="https://genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a>) Android 5
device</li>
<li>Kindle for Android installed on the Android device (the Play store can be
installed on Genymotion)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ It is also possible to use iOS but it is easier to have access to a
virtual Android device since you do not have to own a Mac</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ On Android, it is possible to use user certificates until Android 7
Nougat. After Android 7 Nougat, apps will not use user certificates by
default. More information
<a href="https://blog.jeroenhd.nl/article/android-7-nougat-and-certificate-authorities">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.dinofizzotti.com/blog/2019-01-09-running-a-man-in-the-middle-proxy-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/">a good article to set everything
up</a>.</p>
<p>After all this setup (a bit long and tedious but not hard), it is possible
to record HTTP dumps of the traffic between the Kindle app and Amazon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh pi@192.168.50.10
tmux a -t <span>0</span>
<span># launch mitmdump and write request/response to outfile</span>
mitmdump --mode transparent -w outfile
<span># Use the Kindle app to generate traffic</span>
<span># ctrl-c to stop the proxy</span>
exit #
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, <code>outfile</code> contains all the requests and responses in the
mitmproxy format.</p>
<h2 id="recording-http-dumps">Recording HTTP dumps</h2>
<p>mitmproxy uses a custom format to store dumps. It is not very interoperable:
querying and extracting data from the dumps is a bit difficult. HAR is a
standard format used for example in Chrome and Firefox (Network inspector tabs
in both browser can import/export the HAR format). The HAR format underlying
format is JSON which makes it readable and interoperable with tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>
that are really handy for filtering / querying.</p>
<p>The mitmproxy repository contains a script to transform a mitmproxy
dumpfile into a HAR file.</p>
<p>To convert a mitmproxy dump into an HAR file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy.git mitmproxy <span># to have access to the HAR conversion script</span>
pip install mitmproxy <span># to have the mitmdump command</span>

<span># Extract the dump from the Raspberry Pi</span>
rsync -aPrs pi@192.168.50.10:outfile dump.mitmproxy

<span># Convert mitmproxy format to HAR format (JSON based format)</span>
mitmdump -vvv -n -r infile.dump  -s mitmproxy/examples/complex/har_dump.py --set hardump<span>=</span>./outfile.har
</code></pre></div><h2 id="understanding-the-flow">Understanding the flow</h2>
<p>With jq, we can extract requests URLs, which is handy to
start understanding the flow of communication between Amazon and our
device.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat dumps/dump.har | jq -rc <span>'.log.entries | map(.request.url)'</span>
<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/registerDevice"</span>,

<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/getStoreCredentials"</span>,
<span>"https://52.46.133.19/FionaTodoListProxy/syncMetaData"</span>,

<span># Unique URLS</span>
cat dumps/dump5.har | jq <span>'.log.entries | map(.request.url) | sort | unique'</span>

<span># Filter all requests with a particular URL</span>
cat dumps/dump5.har | jq <span>'.log.entries | map(select(.request.url == "&lt;MY_URL&gt;"))'</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="registration-and-request-signing">Registration and request signing</h2>
<p>The first call the device makes when logging in is a <code>registerDevice</code> call. It
contains both login and password and is used to register a device on Amazon.
After replaying this request through <code>curl</code>, I had a “Wrong password”
response. It is because Amazon sends a two factor authentication email and you
have to replay (again) the registerDevice call with the value from the two
factor authentication email in the password field to get through.</p>
<p>At this point a new device is visible on Amazon Kindle site 🙌. The next things
to do is to fetch the list of books.</p>
<p>The problem now is that we can see that every subsequent request to Amazon has
a <code>X-ADP-Request-Digest</code>: every request is “signed” with the help of a
certificate received in the <code>registerDevice</code> call.</p>
<p>Below, you can see an example request on the <code>syncMetadata</code> route used to get the
list of books:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"startedDateTime"</span>: <span>"2020-05-10T14:21:42.217752+00:00"</span>,

    <span>"httpVersion"</span>: <span>"HTTP/1.1"</span>,
    <span>"headers"</span>: [
      {
        <span>"name"</span>: <span>"X-ADP-Request-Digest"</span>,

      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Signing the request means that I needed to use the right key to sign (I was
pretty confident that the privateKey receive in the registerDevice call was the
one to use) sign the right data = find the fields from the request (and in
which order) that were used to make a fingerprint of the request</p>
<p>Fortunately, after a bit of searching I came across the repositories of
lolsborn (<a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/readsync">readsync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/fiona-client">fiona-client</a>) that had implementation of
request signing for the whispersync API.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        data <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>%s</span><span>\n</span><span>%s</span><span>\n</span><span>%s</span><span>\n</span><span>%s</span><span>\n</span><span>%s</span><span>"</span> <span>%</span> \

<p>From this bit of code, I could see which fields were used and in which order. I
now needed “only” to convert it to Javascript.</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge">node-forge</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa">node-rsa</a>, after a fair bit of
struggle, I managed to have the right signature. I found it difficult even
with two example implementations to get the signature exactly right (I am not
an expert in crypto technologies and did not know both libraries, so I spent a
little bit of time trying to jam the certificate and values in every possible
ways 🙃).</p>
<p>Having a bad signature is not immediately obvious since you have to send a
request to Amazon to check it (and if it’s bad, Amazon sends an <code>Internal Server Error</code>). Using a recorded dump to have an example of the right
signature and using it in a <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> test with a fixed date (since the date is
used in the request) was very helpful as the feedback loop was very quick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ I had to use two different libraries to get the same signature. I am
sure it is possible to use only <code>node-forge</code> though.
ℹ️ The private key is a PKCS8 certificate in DER format encoded in base64.
❓I wonder why to sign the requests, the devices do not generate
a private/public key pair and transmit the public key to Amazon: it is
a bit unusual to have something private fly on the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sidecars">Sidecars</h2>
<p>After cracking the signing part, it was possible to call the <code>syncMedata</code>
route, with a proper digest header, to get all the books in our library
(yay!).</p>
<p>But, the challenge was not done yet: I was most interested in getting the
<em>metadata</em> on the book: my highlights, annotations and last page read. I
needed to find the call that was retrieving all this data.</p>
<p>When searching for the content of a highlight in the dump, I could not find
anything 🤔. When filtering the URLs of the dump with the identifier of the
book (the ASIN in Amazon parlance), some URLs looked interesting:</p>

<center>Vladimir Keleshev • 2020-10-13</center>


<p>LDM—or <em>load multiple</em>—is my favorite assembly instruction of the ARM instruction set. Here’s why.</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss what LDM does. An example:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0, r1, r2, r3}</code></pre>
<p>Here, it takes a <em>base register</em> (in this case, <code>r4</code>) and a <em>register set</em> (in this case, <code>{r0, r1, r2, r3}</code>). It loads consecutive words from the address in the base register into the registers in the set. In this example, the effect could be described using the following C-like pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>r0 = r4[0];
r1 = r4[1];
r2 = r4[2];
r3 = r4[3];</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few assignments for a single instruction! And that’s why it’s called <em>load multiple</em>.</p>
<p>The set notation also allows for ranges. We can rewrite the previous example as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>Any and all of the 16 ARM registers are allowed in the set. So, the following is legal:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15}</code></pre>
<p>The register set is encoded as a 16-bit mask in a 32-bit instruction. Here’s a simplified encoding of the original example:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://keleshev.com/ldm-my-favorite-arm-instruction/ldm-encoding-arm.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Simplified encoding of the LDM instruction</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such instruction is a perfect fit for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load%E2%80%93store_architecture">load-store architecture</a> like ARM, where the primary workflow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>load many values from memory into registers,</li>
<li>perform operations exclusively on registers,</li>
<li>store results back from registers into memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opposite of LDM is STM—<em>store multiple</em>.</p>
<!---Since both of them operate on *sets* of registers (which are implemented as bit masks), you can't directly select the order in which the values are loaded or stored.
The set `{r0, r1, r2}` is the same as `{r2, r1, r0}`.
That's why-->
<h2 id="block-copy">Block copy</h2>
<p>With these two, you can copy large blocks of memory fast. You can copy eight words (or 32 bytes!) of memory in just two instructions:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r4-r11}
stm r1, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<p>LDM and STM also have auto-increment variants (denoted with “!”) where the base register is incremented by the number of words loaded/stored so that you can do the copying in a fast loop:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0!, {r4-r11}
stm r1!, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="implementing-stacks">Implementing stacks</h2>
<p>ARM’s POP instruction is simply an alias for LDM with a stack pointer (and auto-increment). The following two are exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code>ldm sp!, {r0-r3}
pop {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>And the PUSH instruction is an alias for an STM variant (STMDB).</p>
<p>You can push and pop large quantities to and from the stack in one go. And if you replace SP by another register you can implement efficient stacks in other regions of memory. For example, you can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_stack">shadow stack</a> in the heap.</p>
<h2 id="saving-registers">Saving registers</h2>
<p>Are you hesitating to use the call-preserved registers because you need to save them, and you might as well use a stack slot anyway? Not any more, because you can save all call-preserved registers you want to use in one go:</p>
<pre><code>push {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="prologue-and-epilogue">Prologue and epilogue</h2>
<p>On ARM, the first four arguments, the return address (LR) and the frame pointer (FP) are all passed in registers. That’s why it’s especially important to have efficient prologues and epilogues. Fortunately, you can save FP and LR in one go, using a fairly standard ARM prologue:</p>
<pre><code>push {fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>And then restore both and return (for the epilogue):</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, lr}
bx lr</code></pre>
<p>Even better, you can restore both and return in one go!</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, pc}</code></pre>
<p>This works by popping the return address value (LR) into the program counter register (PC), so you don’t need an explicit return!</p>
<p>This is good enough in itself, but you can—<em>at the same time</em>—spill some arguments onto the stack (for example, if their address is taken):</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can save FP and LR and—<em>at the same time</em>—allocate some space on the stack:</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we push <code>r0-r3</code> not for their value but to advance the stack pointer by four words.</p>
<h2 id="arm64">ARM64</h2>
<p>I suspect it was a difficult trade-off, but when it was time to design the 64-bit version of the ARM instruction set, the decision was made to double the number of registers to 32. I remember reading a paper saying that this change improves the performance by about 6% across the board. With 32 registers it is no longer possible to encode a bitmask of all registers into a 32-bit long instruction. So, instead, ARM64 has LDP and STP: load pair and store pair, which are the spiritual successors of LDM and STM.</p>

            <p>
I’ve been reading about Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom.
</p>
<p>
Yuan migrated to the USA from China in the 80s. He had heard Bill Gates speak about the internet and he wanted to be a part of the digital revolution. 
</p>
<p>
So he applied for his visa. He was rejected. He applied again. Rejected again.
</p>
<p>
9 tries. It took Eric Yuan 9 tries to finally get his visa for the USA.
</p>
<p>
Once in the USA, he started working at the video conferencing software company WebEx. 
</p>
<p>
He worked there for a decade and rose up the ranks to become the VP of Engineering. 
</p>
<p>
Under Yuan’s leadership, WebEx grew to more than 750 engineers and had an annual revenue of around $1B (and was later acquired by Cisco). Safe to say the company was doing well. 
</p>
<p>
But there was a problem. 
</p>
<p>
The video conferencing software <em>sucked</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Yuan would meet with customers and they would be unhappy. They’d complain about video and audio lag. Connectivity issues. All sorts of stuff. 
</p>
<p>
In Yuan’s own words:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Before I left Cisco I spent a lot of time talking to WebEx customers and every time I talked to them I felt very embarrassed because I did not see a single happy customer, and I tried to understand why that was.
    <span>Eric Yuan</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
So in 2011, Yuan left. He decided to start his own company with the mission of building the best video conferencing software in the world. 
</p>
<p>
After he left, 40 of the 800 engineers he worked with immediately joined him at Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/dscheinm/status/1300544031458553859">this tweet</a>, almost all of the others sent in resumes to work with him. He had something like 1000 job inquiries within a week of announcing his leaving.
</p>
<p>
Talk about engineering loyalty. 
</p>
<p>
Today Zoom is valued at more than $40 billion. The pandemic may have accelerated the company’s growth but make no mistake: this was an overnight success 9 years in the making. 
</p>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>
I think the part that stands out the most to me is that Yuan actually had the courage to leave Cisco and go on to start Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
There is often great inertia that prevents us from leaving jobs we’re unhappy with. 
</p>
<p>
In Yuan’s case, he had by all measures a very successful career ever since he immigrated to the US. Most people in his shoes wouldn’t even bother resigning from a comfortable VP of Engineering position. 
</p>
<p>
So he could have settled and just resigned himself to the fact that maybe video conferencing software was supposed to be like this. After all, there was very little competition in the market. 
</p>
<p>
But he didn’t. He chose discomfort and hundreds of other engineers believed in him. 
</p>
<p>
Keep moving forward and don’t settle. You might be surprised at how many people follow you. 
</p>
