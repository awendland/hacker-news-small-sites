                        A simple solution for routing specific docker containers through a WireGuard VPN using only two simple systemd-networkd files, no cumbersome <code>wg</code> or <code>ip</code> calls.

<p><a href="#instructions-in-short">Jump to short instructions</a></p>
<p>I recently reorganized my self-hosted stuff to use Docker. While Docker not really fits my philosophy, the broad availability and low-maintenance of images for pretty much all software convinced me to switch and so far I’m happy, it’s significantly less work than before, I can check the Docker Compose files into version control, and backups are easy with everthing inside Docker volumes.</p>

<p>Anyway – here is the scenario I want to talk about: You have one or more Docker containers and you want to route all its traffic through a WireGuard VPN, but not the other containers’ or the host’s traffic. You have root access to the host machine.</p>

<h2 id="wg-quick">wg-quick</h2>
<p>The most straightforward way of using WireGuard is <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8"><em>wg-quick</em></a>. You just need a configuration file, about 10 lines long (take a look at an OpenVPN config file and you will appreciate this shortness), run <code>sudo wg-quick up {config file}</code> and your VPN is up and running. These files also work with the Android/iOS/MacOS/Windows apps.</p>
<p>For example, the VPN provider <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a>, which I can recommend 100%, lets you download wg-quick files for easy setup.</p>
<p>wg-quick is easy, but it routes <em>all</em> traffic through the VPN, which is what you want <em>most of the times</em>, but not in our use case. Watch out, the allowed IP range does not help as you might think: You can tell WireGuard that only traffic <em>to</em> specific IPs should be routed through the VPN, which makes sense for something like a VPN for employees: only traffic to the company’s network should go through the VPN. We however need to filter by <em>source</em>. wg-quick can’t do that.</p>

<p>After quite a lot of searching I finally found a great <a href="https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/routing-select-docker-containers-through-wireguard-vpn#solution-2">blog article</a> detailing a solution to our exact problem using the <code>wg</code> and <code>ip</code> tools directly (and one using WireGuard client inside another container). This article is mostly based on that one.</p>
<p>The gist of that that method is: You set up a WireGuard interface manually, the same way wg-quick does internally, but without any routing to it yet. Then you add a routing rule via <code>ip</code> that sends all traffic from a specific subnet to the VPN. Lastly, you configure the desired Docker container to use exactly that subnet using Docker Compose or <code>docker network</code>.</p>
<p>While it is a nice and elegant solution, I think it is kind of cumbersome to configure, so I tried to find a more comfortable way of setting this up.</p>
<h2 id="systemd-networkd">systemd-networkd</h2>
<p>While I agree with some of the criticism against systemd and its policies, systemd-networkd really is the best thing that ever happened to network configuration on Linux. Instead of fiddling around with awfully complex tools like <code>ip</code> or weird network managers, you can set up your network with short, few and well-documented plain-text config files. I love it. Turns out it also has everything we need for tunneling our Docker containers, and in a nice and easy way. This is the solution I went with and want to show you.</p>

<p>For the impatient. For detailed instructions see below.</p>
<p>To tunnel a container through a WireGuard VPN given a wg-quick config file from your VPN provider, add these files to <code>/etc/systemd/network/</code>:</p>
<p><strong><code>80-wg0.netdev</code>:</strong></p>

<p>Then run <code>sudo docker network create tunneled0 --subnet 10.123.0.0</code>. Now you can run docker containers with <code>--net=tunneled0</code> to tunnel them.</p>
<p>Alternatively use Docker Compose to create and use a Docker network in that subnet:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>version</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3.7"</span></span>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>Make sure that your host has:</p>
<ul>
<li>systemd. Most Linuxes do.</li>
<li>The WireGuard kernel module installed or kernel 5.6 or newer running.</li>
<li>The WireGuard tools installed.</li>
<li>Docker and optionally Docker Compose installed.</li>
<li>A working network connection. I don’t think it needs to be configured using systemd-networkd, though I haven’t tested that. I recommend to use networkd if possible anyway.</li>
<li>systemd-networkd running and enabled (<code>sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd &amp;&amp; systemctl start system-networkd</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-interface">Setting up the Interface</h2>
<p>First we have to get the WireGuard interface running. We couldn’t do it with <code>wg-quick</code> as it automatically routes all traffic through it, and using <code>wg</code> is cumbersome, so we use systemd-networkd. All we have to do is add two files in <code>/etc/systemd/network/</code>:</p>
<p><strong><code>80-wg0.netdev</code>:</strong></p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>[NetDev]</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span># Or any other name</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>Name </span><span>=</span><span> wg0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><span>Kind </span><span>=</span><span> wireguard</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span># Or your own description</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><span>Description </span><span>=</span><span> WireGuard VPN</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><span>[WireGuard]</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><span>PrivateKey </span><span>=</span><span> {Private key, same as in wg-quick config}</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10"></span>
<span id="cb4-11"><span>[WireGuardPeer]</span></span>
<span id="cb4-12"><span>PublicKey </span><span>=</span><span> {Public key, same as in wg-quick config}</span></span>
<span id="cb4-13"><span># Remeber, these are allowed target IPs, not source, therefore we allow all</span></span>
<span id="cb4-14"><span>AllowedIPs </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0.0</span><span>/</span><span>0</span><span>,::</span><span>0</span><span>/</span><span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-15"><span>Endpoint</span><span>=</span><span> {Endpoint, same as in wg-quick config}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong><code>85-wg0.network</code>:</strong></p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>[Match]</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span># Same as in .netdev file</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>Name</span><span>=</span><span>wg0</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><span>[Network]</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span># If you need multiple addresses, e.g. for IPv4 and 6, use multiple Address lines.</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><span>Address </span><span>=</span><span> {Address to bind to inside the VPN, same as in wg-quick config}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, it’s very similar to and just as easy as a wg-quick config file and most values can be taken straight from said file. For more info take a look at the man pages of <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.netdev.html">netdev</a> and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.network.html">network</a> files.</p>
<p>The names of the files can be adjusted to your liking. Note that systemd-networkd reads config files in alphabetic order, so adjust the prefixed numbers in the names if necessary.</p>
<p>Use <code># systemctl restart systemd-networkd</code> (or reboot to be sure) to apply the configs. Now you can verify that the inferface is actually working:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -4 icanhazip.com
$ sudo curl -4 --interface wg0 icanhazip.com</code></pre>
<p>The results of the two <code>curl</code> calls should be different, the first shows your normal IP, the second one should yield the VPN IP address. Note that for me the second curl only works as root (probably curl can only bind to the interface as root for some reason). With <code>sudo wg</code> and <code>networkctl status wg0</code> you can get further info about the interface.</p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>Now that we got the WireGuard interface up and running we have to arrange for the traffic of our Docker container to actually go through it. Turns out all we have to do is adding four lines to <code>85-wg0.network</code>. This it how it should look like:</p>
<p><strong>Updated <code>85-wg0.network</code>:</strong></p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>[Match]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>Name</span><span>=</span><span>wg0</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>[Network]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span># If you need multiple addresses, e.g. for IPv4 and 6, use multiple Address lines.</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>Address </span><span>=</span><span> {Address to bind to inside the VPN, same as in wg-quick config}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><span>[RoutingPolicyRule]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><span># Or any other unused private subnet</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><span>From </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>.</span><span>123</span><span>.</span><span>0.0</span><span>/</span><span>16</span></span>
<span id="cb7-11"><span># Or any other unused table number</span></span>
<span id="cb7-12"><span>Table </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>242</span></span>
<span id="cb7-13"></span>
<span id="cb7-14"><span>[Route]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-15"><span>Gateway </span><span>=</span><span> {The address of the interface, same as above}</span></span>
<span id="cb7-16"><span># Same table number as above</span></span>
<span id="cb7-17"><span>Table </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>242</span></span>
<span id="cb7-18"></span>
<span id="cb7-19"><span>[Route]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-20"><span>Destination </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0.0</span><span>/</span><span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb7-21"><span>Type </span><span>=</span><span> blackhole</span></span>
<span id="cb7-22"><span>Metric </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb7-23"><span># Same table number as above</span></span>
<span id="cb7-24"><span>Table </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>242</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What the <code>[RoutingPolicyRule]</code> section does is taking all traffic from the specified subnet and looking up the routes in routing table 242 for it. We add a route to (hopefully previously empty) table 242 with the <code>[Route]</code> section, and that route sends the traffic to our WireGuard interface because we set the interface’s address as gateway.</p>
<p>The second <code>[Route]</code> section sets a blackhole route in the same table with a metric of 1, that means a lower priority than the default metric of 0. This should discard all traffic (instead of routing it through the default network without any VPN) if the VPN gateway is down and therefore prevent leaks.</p>
<p>That should be all we have to do on the system side!</p>
<h2 id="using-it-with-docker">Using it with Docker</h2>
<p>To actually get Docker to use the interface with specific containers we have two possibilities.</p>
<p>Note for both methods that published ports will not be available on <code>localhost</code> on the host as they normally would as all container traffic goes through the VPN (which is what we wanted, of course). So if you add an exposed port it must be accessed through the VPN’s outside address.</p>
<h3 id="docker-directly">Docker Directly</h3>
<p>Create a Docker network in the subnet we used in the systemd-networkd config file with <code>sudo docker network create tunneled0 --subnet 10.123.0.0</code> (or use any other name than <code>tunneled0</code>), then run containers in that network by using the <code>--net=tunneled0</code> option. With the <code>--dns</code> option you can set a custom DNS so that no DNS traffic gets leaked.</p>
<p>For example, you can use <code>sudo docker run -t --net=tunneled0 curlimages/curl icanhazip.com</code> to check that the returned IP is actually the VPN’s IP.</p>
<h3 id="docker-compose">Docker Compose</h3>
<p>This is the more comfortable method. You can use this as a base for your own compose files:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>version</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"3.7"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>services</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>  </span><span>app</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>    </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>image</span><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><span>    </span><span>dns</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"{DNS server to use}"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>    </span><span>networks</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><span>      # Or your own name</span></span>
<span id="cb8-8"><span>      </span><span>tunneled0</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-9"><span>networks</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-10"><span>  # Same name as above</span></span>
<span id="cb8-11"><span>  </span><span>tunneled0</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-12"><span>    </span><span>ipam</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-13"><span>      </span><span>config</span><span>:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-14"><span>        </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>subnet</span><span>:</span><span> 10.123.0.0/16</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="port-forwarding">Port Forwarding</h2>
<p>You can use Docker’s normal port publishing options to make ports available through the VPN. So, for example, if your VPN provider gives you port <code>1234</code> and you want port <code>80</code> inside your container to be available through the VPN, call Docker with <code>-p 1234:80</code> (do not forget …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h4><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Guides</a> / <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a></h4><div><p>We all have a finite amount of time to live, and within that mortal countdown we devote some fraction towards our work. Even for the most career-focused, your life will be filled by many things beyond work: supporting your family, children, exercise, being a mentor and a mentee, hobbies, and so the list goes on. This is the sign of a rich life, but one side-effect is that time to do your work will become increasingly scarce as you get deeper into your career.</p>
<p>If you’re continuing to advance in your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing. For a while you can try sleeping less or depriving yourself of the non-work activities you need to feel whole, but you’ll inevitably find that your work maintains an aloof indifference to your sacrifice rather than rewarding it. Only through <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">pacing your career to your life</a> can you sustain yourself for the long-term.</p>
<p>Indeed, pacing yourself becomes the central challenge of a sustained, successful career: increasingly senior roles require that you accomplish more and more, and do it in less and less time. The ledge between these two constraints gets narrower the further you go, but it remains walkable if you take a deliberate approach.</p>
<p>First a discussion on a few common ways to get tripped up: <em>snacking</em>, <em>preening</em>, and <em>chasing ghosts</em>. Then we’ll get into the good stuff: how <em>do</em> you work on what really matters?</p>
<h2>Avoid snacking</h2>
<p>Hunter Walk recommends that folks <a href="https://hunterwalk.com/2016/06/18/the-best-startups-resists-snacks-im-not-talking-about-food/">avoid “snacking”</a> when they prioritize work. If you’re in a well-run organization, at some point you’re going to run out of things that are both high-impact and easy. This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice--easy and low-impact--is what Walk refers to as <em>snacking</em>.</p>
<p>When you’re busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding but you’re unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (<em>and</em> for some of them it might be a good development opportunity), and there’s a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact.</p>
<p>It’s ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you’re spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you’re more likely to self-determine your work and if you’re not deliberately tracking your work, it’s easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.</p>
<h2>Stop preening</h2>
<p>Where “snacking” is the broad category of doing easy and low-impact work, there’s a particularly seductive subset of snacking that I call “preening.” Preening is doing low-impact, high-visibility work. Many companies conflate high-visibility and high-impact so strongly that they can’t distinguish between preening and impact, which is why it’s not uncommon to see some companies’ senior-most engineers spend the majority of their time doing work of dubious value but that is frequently recognized in company meetings.</p>
<p>If you’re taking a short-term look at <a href="https://yenkel.dev/posts/how-to-achieve-career-growth-opportunities-skills-sponsors">career growth</a>, then optimizing for your current organization’s pathologies in evaluating impact is the optimal path: go forth and preen gloriously. However, if you’re thinking about developing yourself to succeed as your <a href="https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/">current role grows in complexity</a> or across multiple organizations, then it’s far more important to strike a balance between valued work and self-growth.</p>
<p>This is also an important factor to consider when choosing a company to work at! Dig into what a company values and ensure it aligns with your intended personal growth. If a company’s leadership is entirely folks who focus their energy on performant urgency or acts of fealty, don’t be surprised when your success in the company depends on those activities.</p>
<p>Worse, to be a successful preener requires a near invulnerability to criticism of your actual impact, and your true work <em>will</em> suffer if your energy is diverted to preening. Typically this means you need to be a vanity hire of a senior leader or to present yourself in the way a company believes leaders look and act. If that isn’t you, then your attempt to exchange your good judgement for company success will end up failing anyway: you’ll get held accountable for the lack of true impact where others who match the company’s expectation of how a leader appears will somehow slip upward.</p>
<h2>Stop chasing ghosts</h2>
<p>Many folks would assume that companies, rational optimizers that they are, avoid spending much time on low-impact high-effort projects. Unfortunately that isn’t consistently the case. It’s surprisingly common for a new senior leader to join a company and immediately drive <a href="https://lethain.com/grand-migration/">a strategy shift that fundamentally misunderstands the challenges at hand</a>. The ghosts of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential.</p>
<p>As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing into meaningless work at a grand scale. This can be surprisingly challenging when during your hiring process you’ve been repeatedly told that you’ve been hired to fix something deeply broken -- you’re the newly-hired savior, of course your instincts are right! Taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results.</p>
<p>I had a recent discussion with someone who argued that new senior leaders <em>deliberately</em> push for major changes even though they suspect the efforts will fail. Such changes make the organization increasingly dependent on the new leader, and also ensures anything that <em>does</em> go well gets attributed to the new leader directly rather than their team. If this is your approach to leadership, please know that you’re awful and take the time to work on yourself until the well-being and success of an entire company matters to you more than being perceived as essential.</p>
<h2>Existential issues</h2>
<p>Now that you’re done snacking, preening and chasing ghosts, the first place to look for work that matters is exploring whether your company is experiencing an existential risk. Companies operate in an eternal <a href="https://lethain.com/iterative-elimination-tournaments/">iterative elimination tournament</a>, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present. If you’re about to lose one of those rounds, then always focus there.</p>
<p>Running out of money, <a href="https://lethain.com/digg-v4/">like my experience at Digg</a>, can be the most obvious issue, but not every existential issue is financial, like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/">Twitter’s fail whale stability challenges</a> or adapting to the shifts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>If something dire is happening at your company, then that’s the place to be engaged. Nothing else will matter if it doesn’t get addressed.</p>
<h2>Work where there’s room <em>and</em> attention</h2>
<p>Existential issues are usually <em>not</em> the most efficient place to add your efforts, but efficiency isn’t a priority when the walls are crashing down around you. You <em>should</em> swarm to existential problems, but if a problem isn’t existential then you should be skeptical of adding your efforts where everyone’s already focused. Folks often chase leadership’s top priority, but with so many folks looking to make their impact there, it’s often challenging to have a meaningful impact.</p>
<p>Instead, the most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work. What are priorities that will become critical in the future, where you can do great work ahead of time? Where are areas that are doing <em>ok</em> but could be doing <em>great</em> with your support?</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll find work that’s <em>worthy</em> of attention, but which an organization is incapable of paying attention to, usually because its leadership doesn’t value that work. In some companies this is developer tooling work, in others it’s inclusion work, and in most companies it’s <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">glue work</a>.</p>
<p>There is almost always a great deal of room to do this sort of work that no one is paying attention to, so you’ll be able to make rapid initial progress on it, which <em>feels</em> like a good opportunity to invest. At some point, though, you’ll find that the work needs support, and it’s quite challenging to get support for work that a company is built to ignore or devalue. Your early wins will slowly get eroded by indifference and misalignment, and your initial impact will be reclaimed by the sands of time.</p>
<p>Does this mean you shouldn’t do inclusion work? No, that’s not the conclusion I want you to take away from this. Sometimes an area that an organization doesn’t pay attention to is so important that you’re going to want to advocate for it to start paying attention. Teaching a company to value something it doesn’t care about is considerably the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less. As a senior leader, you have an ethical obligation that goes beyond maximizing your company-perceived impact, but it’s important to recognize what you’re up against and time your efforts accordingly.</p>
<h2>Foster growth</h2>
<p>One area that’s often underinvested in (e.g. lots of room to work in) while also being highly leveraged is growing the team around you. <em>Hiring</em> has a lot of folks involved in it, usually in terms of optimizing the <a href="https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/">hiring funnel</a>, but onboarding, mentoring and coaching are wholly neglected at many companies despite being <em>at least</em> <a href="https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/">as impactful as hiring to your company’s engineering velocity</a>.</p>
<p>If you start dedicating even a couple hours a week to developing the team around you, it’s quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.</p>
<h2>Edit</h2>
<p>A surprising number of projects are one small change away from succeeding, one quick modification that unlocks a new opportunity, or one conversation away from consensus. I think of making those small changes, quick modifications and short conversations as <em>editing</em> your team’s …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p><em>On September 15, 2020, a small group of people worked through the night to rescue over 9.6MM USD from a vulnerable smart contract. This is our story.</em></p><p>I was about to wrap up for the night when I decided to take another look at some smart contracts.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting anything interesting, of course. Over the past few weeks I had seen countless yield farming clones launch with the exact same pitch: stake your tokens with us and you could be the next cryptocurrency millionaire. Most were simply forks of well-audited code although some tweaked bits and pieces, sometimes with catastrophic results.</p><p>But amidst all of the noise there was some code I hadn’t seen before. The contract held over 25,000 Ether, worth over 9,600,000 USD at the time, and would be a very juicy payday for anyone who managed to find a bug in its logic.</p><p>I quickly looked through the code for where Ether is transferred out and found two hits. One of them transferred the Ether to a hardcoded token address, so that could be ignored. The second was a burn function that transferred Ether to the sender. After tracing the usage of this function, I discovered that it would be trivial for anyone to mint tokens to themselves for free, but then burn them in exchange for all of the Ether in the contract. My heart jumped. Suddenly, things had become serious.</p><p>Some digging revealed that the contract I had found was part of <a href="https://lien.finance/">Lien Finance</a>’s protocol. Unfortunately, their team was anonymous! The only IM platform they supported was Telegram, and I couldn’t be sure that the admins of that channel were actually protocol developers or just a few early supporters. The last thing I wanted to do was accidentally leak the exploit to the wrong person.</p><p>After browsing their website a little while longer, I noticed that they had worked with ConsenSys Diligence and CertiK for an audit. This seemed like a good avenue, since both ConsenSys and CertiK must have interacted with the developers during their audits. I quickly pinged <a href="https://twitter.com/maurelian_">maurelian</a> on Telegram.</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>You never want to be on the receiving end of this message</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, time ticked on, my heart kept pounding, but there was no response from maurelian. It seemed like he had already gone to sleep. Desperate, I sent a message to the ETHSecurity Telegram channel.</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Artist's rendering of the message, since I deleted the original</figcaption></figure><p>Within minutes, I got a message from someone I’d worked with quite a few times in the past - <a href="https://twitter.com/wadealexc">Alex Wade</a>.</p><hr><p>My head had just hit the pillow when I got a knock on my door. It was my roommate: “Sam’s in the ETHSec Telegram asking for anyone from Diligence.”</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>It was, in fact, a long night</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing Sam, this couldn’t be good. I found a channel we’d set up with Lien a few months ago and an email address. Better than nothing, given their team was anon.</p><p>I was still half asleep. Sam, not wanting to commit details to text, asked for a Zoom call. Groggily wishing I was back in bed, I attempted to gauge the severity of the situation:</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Five minutes later, it was clear that the situation called for coffee</figcaption></figure><p>Sam and I reviewed the code together. By this point, Sam had already prepared a sample exploit and was able to confirm the issue on his machine. The conversation quickly turned to discussing options:</p><ol><li>Attempt to exploit the issue ourselves.</li><li>Reach out to Lien and have them go public, urging users to withdraw.</li></ol><p>Neither of these were appealing options. The first was risky because, as discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff">Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/danrobinson">Dan Robinson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gakonst/">Georgios Konstantopoulos</a>, the possibility of our transactions getting frontrun was very real. The second option was similarly risky, as a public announcement would draw attention to the problem and create a window of opportunity for attackers. We needed a third option.</p><p>Recalling a section from <em>Ethereum is a Dark Forest</em>, Sam reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/epheph">Scott Bigelow</a>:</p><blockquote>If you find yourself in a situation like this, we suggest you reach out to Scott Bigelow, a security researcher who has been studying this topic and has a prototype implementation for a better obfuscator.</blockquote><hr><p>After participating in the recovery attempt from <em>Ethereum is a Dark Forest, </em>which ultimately lost to front-runners, I was hungry for a re-match. I’ve spent time monitoring front-running and designing a simple system that seemed able to fool generalized front-runners, at least for the $200 I’d been able to test it with. When Sam reached out to me in the late evening with the innocent-sounding “mind staying up for another hour or so”, I couldn’t wait to try it out! I was already working it out: how I’d make a few tweaks, stay up a couple hours, feel a sense of accomplishment having helped rescue and return a few thousand dollars of user funds, and get a good night’s sleep.</p><p>Those plans immediately fell apart when Sam shared the contract with me: ~25,000 ETH, valued at $9.6M, at stake. For as much as I wanted that rematch, $9.6M was way outside my humble script’s weight class.</p><p><br>For the past few months, I had been trying to establish contacts with miners for this very purpose: white-hat transaction cooperation. If ever there was a time to appeal to a miner to include a transaction without giving front-runners the chance to steal it, it was now. Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/tzhen">Tina</a> and I have worked together over the past few months on establishing this cooperation. It seemed like a slim chance at the time, but it was worth a shot: let’s bring Tina into the rescue attempt to work with a mining pool to mine a private transaction.</p><hr><p>I had just evacuated from the Bobcat forest fire and was sipping on unknown beachy drinks zoning out to the monotonic sound of dark Pacific waves, when a Telegram DM from Sam buzzed me back to a darker reality: “funds at risk, frontrunnable”. Over the last few weeks, I had been collaborating with Sam and Scott on a research project on MEV and could already guess their ask before they sent it: a direct channel to shield a whitehat tx from getting sniped by the “advanced predators” in the mempool’s “dark forest”.</p><p>Since this was a risky move that entailed exposing our strategy to miners, we decided we should first try to get the greenlight from the anonymous Lien team. While Alex was trying to get in contact via ConsenSys-internal channels, we tried to loop in CertiK as well.</p><p>I realized it may take another 4 hours before Certik's US-based auditors would wake up, yet the clock was ticking. &nbsp;Knowing nothing much about CertiK beyond the fact it had serviced quite a few Asian projects, I tried to reach the CertiK China team to arbitrage the time zone difference. I blasted a casual sounding message in “DeFi the World” and “Yellow Hats” WeChat groups. Four leads slid into my DMs independently within 30 minutes, confirming the WeChat ID that I connected with was indeed the real Zhaozhong Ni, CTO of CertiK. I was added to a WeChat group with 5 CertiK team members, yet at this point I was still not in a position to disclose the project nor the vulnerability. To minimize the exposure and potential liability, we could only invite one member from Certik to join our whitehat operation. After passing a final verification via official email, Georgios Delkos, the engineering lead at CertiK joined our call.</p><p>With Georgios’s help, Alex was able to quickly get in contact with the Lien team and verify their identity. We brought them up-to-speed on the current situation and asked for their permission to try working directly with a mining pool to rescue the vulnerable funds. After some deliberation, the Lien team agreed that the risk from trying to rescue the funds directly or publishing a warning was too high, and gave the go-ahead to continue.</p><p>Now we needed to identify a mining pool that had the infrastructure ready in place and would be willing to cooperate with us ASAP. Which mining pool should we tap? Which contact from the pool would be in a position to make technical decisions swiftly that help us beat the clock?</p><p>SparkPool came to mind, as I knew they had been working on a piece of public infrastructure called Taichi Network that could easily offer what we needed. I decided to ping Shaoping Zhang, SparkPool’s co-founder, who had helped me investigate mempool events in the past.</p><p>Half an hour later, Shaoping responded: “You mean do we have a whitelist service for transactions? Sorry, we don’t.” Oops, something was lost in translation, “whitehat” and “whitelist” sounded similar in Chinese.</p><p>“There’s 10mn dollar worth of funds at risk. samczsun is on the line.” I tried again to communicate the situation without revealing any specifics.</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png" alt="" srcset="https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 600w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1000w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1600w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>“Are you guys saving the world again? Do you need help from our mining pool?” To my surprise and great relief, Shaoping jokingly extended an offer to help. After official email verification, Shaoping popped into our marathon Zoom call with the support of a roomful of SparkPool devs.</p><hr><p>After lunch, just when I was about to take a nap, I received a message from Tina: “Has SparkPool ever helped with whitehat transactions??” I mistook it for whitelisting a transaction at first. No whitehats had approached us before, and we were not familiar with what “whitehat transactions” entailed. After Tina explained it in more details, I realized that what they needed was a private transaction service, i.e. the whitehats wanted to send transactions to save a DeFi contract, but in order to prevent getting front-runned, they needed a mining pool to include the transaction without broadcasting it.</p><p>We had been working on a “private transaction” feature on our Taichi Network, which was still under development and had not been tested. I brought the whitehats’ request to our development team, and explained the urgency: our private transaction feature needed to be in production within a few hours. Our devs said they could try their best to finish in time, and we immediately got to work. We finished development of the private transaction feature in 2 hours, and then spent some time fixing bugs.</p><p>After we completed our internal testing, we sent the <em>whitehat.taichi.network</em> endpoint to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Just a short one today:
New users of Julia coming from other dynamically typed languages might write functions like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>isa</span> <span>Int</span>
        <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>elseif</span> <span>x</span> <span>isa</span> <span>Float64</span>
        <span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span>
    <span>elseif</span> <span>x</span> <span>isa</span> <span>String</span>
        <span>length</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>1</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is clearly unidiomatic and should be written as</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Float64</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>length</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span># or bar(x::Any), to be explicit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>because it is nicer to read and very easy to extend for other types of <code>x</code>.
Well, you technically can extend <code>foo</code> the same way as <code>bar</code>, but reading the definition of <code>foo</code> one would expect to then know its complete behavior, so it would be misleading.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, my point is that there is actually (maybe surprisingly) no harm at runtime for code as in <code>foo</code>!
The Julia compiler isn’t tricked that easily and will still produce optimal machine code for each type of the argument:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>@code_native</span> <span>debuginfo</span><span>=:</span><span>none</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>text</span>
    <span>leaq</span>	<span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>),</span> <span>%</span><span>rax</span>
    <span>retq</span>
    <span>nopw</span>	<span>%</span><span>cs</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>)</span>

<span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>@code_native</span> <span>debuginfo</span><span>=:</span><span>none</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>text</span>
    <span>leaq</span>	<span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>),</span> <span>%</span><span>rax</span>
    <span>retq</span>
    <span>nopw</span>	<span>%</span><span>cs</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Both functions basically compile down to a single adding instruction (<code>leaq</code>; <code>retq</code> is for returning from the function and <code>nopw</code> is an operation that does nothing and is there for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_%28code%29%23Machine_language_instructions">technical reasons</a>).
Think about it this way:
When Julia compiles <code>foo(1)</code>, it knows that <code>1</code> is of type <code>Int</code>, can evaluate the <code>x isa Int</code> expression at compile time to <code>true</code>, and discard everything but the <code>x + x</code> without a problem.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">“Appendix”</h2>
<p>For completeness, here is what’s produced in the other cases:</p>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-5/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. This time I want to take a break
from compiling and finally add a <em>reader</em>. I’m finally getting frustrated
manually entering increasinly complicated ASTs, so I figure it is time. After
this post, we’ll be able to type in programs like:</p>



<p>and have our compiler make ASTs for us! Magic. This will also add some nice
debugging tools for us. For example, imagine an interactive command line
utility in which we can enter Lisp expressions and the compiler prints out
human-readable assembly (and hex? maybe?). It could even run the code, too.
Check out this imaginary demo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lisp&gt; 1
; mov rax, 0x4
=&gt; 1
lisp&gt; (add1 1)
; mov rax, 0x4
; add rax, 0x4
=&gt; 2
lisp&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wow, what a thought.</p>

<h3 id="the-reader-interface">The Reader interface</h3>

<p>To make this interface as simple and testable as possible, I want the reader
interface to take in a C string and return an <code>ASTNode *</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>Reader_read</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can add interfaces later to support reading from a <code>FILE*</code> or file
descriptor or something, but for now we’ll just use strings and line-based
input.</p>

<p>On success, we’ll return a fully-formed <code>ASTNode*</code>. But on error, well, hold
on. We can’t just return <code>NULL</code>. On many platforms, <code>NULL</code> is defined to be
<code>0</code>, which is how we encode the integer <code>0</code>. On others, it could be defined to
be <code>0x55555555</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> or something equally silly. Regardless, its value might
overlap with our type encoding scheme in some unintended way.</p>

<p>This means that we have to go ahead and add another immediate object: an
<code>Error</code> object. We have some open immediate tag bits, so sure, why not. We can
also use this to signal runtime errors and other fun things. It’ll probably be
useful.</p>

<h3 id="the-error-object">The Error object</h3>

<p>Back to the object tag diagram. Below I have reproduced the tag diagram from
previous posts, but now with a new entry (denoted by <code>&lt;-</code>). This new entry
shows the encoding for the canonical <code>Error</code> object.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>High							     Low
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX00  Integer
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000XXXXXXX00001111  Character
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000X0011111  Boolean
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101111  Nil
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111  Error &lt;-
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX001  Pair
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX010  Vector
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX011  String
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX101  Symbol
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX110  Closure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we wanted to, we could even add additional tag bits to the (currently all 0)
payload, to signal different kinds of errors. Maybe later. For now, we add a
tag constant and associated <code>Object</code> and <code>AST</code> functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kErrorTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x3f</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b111111</span>
<span>uword</span> <span>Object_error</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>kErrorTag</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_error</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>==</span> <span>Object_error</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_error</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_error</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That should be enough to get us going for now. Perhaps we could even convert
our <code>Compile_</code> suite of functions to use this object instead of an <code>int</code>. It
would certainly be more informative. Maybe in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="language-syntax">Language syntax</h3>

<p>Let’s get back to business and think about what we want our language to look
like. This is a Lisp series but really you could adapt your reader to read any
sort of syntax. No need for parentheses if you’re allergic.</p>

<p>I’m going to use this simple Lisp reader because it’s short and simple, so
we’ll have some parens.</p>

<p>First, our integers will look like integers in most languages — <code>0</code>, <code>123</code>,
<code>-123</code>.</p>

<p>You can add support for other bases if you like, but I don’t plan on it here.</p>

<p>Second, our characters will look like C characters — <code>'a'</code>, <code>'b'</code>, etc. Some
implementations opt for <code>#'a</code> but that has always looked funky to me.</p>

<p>Third, our booleans will be <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>. You’re also welcome to go ahead and
use symbols to represent the names, avoid special syntax, and have those
symbols evaluate to truthy and falsey values.</p>

<p>Fourth, the nil object will be <code>()</code>. We can also later bind the symbol <code>nil</code> to
mean <code>()</code>, too.</p>

<p>I’m going to skip error objects, because they don’t yet have any sort of
user-land meaning yet — they’re just used in compiler infrastructure right
now.</p>

<p>Fifth, pairs will look like <code>(1 2 3)</code>, meaning <code>(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3
nil)))</code>. I don’t plan on adding support for dotted pair syntax. Whitespace will
be insignificant.</p>

<p>Sixth, symbols will look like any old ASCII identifier: <code>hello</code>, <code>world</code>,
<code>fooBar</code>. I’ll also include some punctuation in there, too, so we can use <code>+</code>
and <code>-</code> as symbols, for example. Or we could even go full Lisp and use
<code>train-case</code> identifiers.</p>

<p>I’m going to skip closures, since they don’t have a syntactic representation
— they are just objects known to the runtime. Vectors and strings don’t have
any implementation right now so we’ll add those to the reader later.</p>

<p>That’s it! Key points are: mind your plus and minus signs since they can appear
in both integers and symbols; don’t read off the end; have fun.</p>

<h3 id="the-reader-implementation">The Reader implementation</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve rather informally specified what our language looks like, we can
write a small reader. We’ll start with the <code>Reader_read</code> function from above.</p>

<p>This function will just be a shell around an internal function with some more
parameters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>Reader_read</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>read_rec</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because we need to carry around some more state to read through this
string. We need to know how far into the string we are. I chose to use an
additional <code>word</code> for the index. Some might prefer a <code>char**</code> instead. Up to
you.</p>

<p>With any recursive reader invocation, we should advance through all the
whitespace, because it doesn’t mean anything to us. For this reason, we have a
handy-dandy <code>skip_whitespace</code> function that reads through all the whitespace
and then returns the next non-whitespace character.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>++*</span><span>pos</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>char</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>char</span> <span>skip_whitespace</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span> <span>isspace</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>pos</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use <code>skip_whitespace</code> in the <code>read_rec</code> function to fetch the next
non-whitespace character. Then we’ll use that character (and sometimes the
following one, too) to determine what structure we’re about to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>starts_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>default:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>isalpha</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that I put the integer cases above the symbol case because we want to
catch <code>-123</code> as an integer instead of a symbol, and <code>-a123</code> as a symbol instead
of an integer.</p>

<p>We’ll probably add more entries to <code>starts_symbol</code> later, but those should
cover the names we’ve used so far.</p>

<p>For each type of subcase (integer, symbol, list), the basic idea is the same:
while we’re still inside the subcase, add on to it.</p>

<p>For integers, this means multiplying and adding (concatenating digits, so to
speak):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>read_integer</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>sign</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span> <span>isdigit</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>pos</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_new_integer</span><span>(</span><span>sign</span> <span>*</span> <span>result</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It also takes a sign parameter so if we see an explicit <code>-</code>, we can negate the
integer.</p>

<p>For symbols, this means reading characters into a C string buffer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>word</span> <span>ATOM_MAX</span> <span>=</span> <span>32</span><span>;</span>

<span>bool</span> <span>is_symbol_char</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
  <span>buf</span><span>[</span><span>length</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I avoided dynamic resizing. We only get at most symbols
of size 32. Oh well.</p>

<p>Note that symbols can also have trailing numbers in them, just not at the front
— like <code>add1</code>.</p>

<p>For characters, we only have three potential input characters to look at:
quote, char, quote. No need for a loop:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>read_char</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>==</span> <span>'\''</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>AST_error</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>'\''</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>AST_error</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_new_char</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that input like <code>''</code> or <code>'aa'</code> will be an error.</p>

<p>For booleans, we can tackle those inline because there’s only two cases and
they’re both trivial. Check for <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>. Done.</p>

<p>And last, for lists, it means we recursively build up pairs until we get to
<code>nil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>read_list</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<!-- <div class="subtitle"></div> -->

<p>Names are fundamental to human existence and how we relate to everything in the world. At the heart of all interactions lies the ability for all the parties to match names to the respective entities they stand for.</p>

<p>Names are so integral to the human experience that a strong argument can be made that if <em>something doesnâ€™t have a name, it does not exist.</em></p>

<p>Correspondingly, names on the internet are critical to our online existence. Users, apps, or machines locate a resource on the internet via its name. The name needs to not only be understood by humans but also needs to be uniquely identifiable by machines amongst the billions of potential destinations.</p>

<p>Given that the act of matching a name to the eventual resource is the starting point of trillions of internet transactions that happen daily,  it is no surprise that out of the three core layers of internet stack - naming (DNS), transportation (TCP/IP) and application (HTTP), naming is at the very start of the stack.</p>

<p>Naming needs a single source of truth as the names within the namespaces have to be unique across the whole system. Hence, an effective naming system cannot merely be a standard or a protocol, it has to meet all the other aspects of running an internet-scale namespace - including enforcement of unique names, the management of the naming records, scaling to internet traffic, while remaining fully accessible to anyone, anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>

<p>Names are the most valuable assets on the internet, but we donâ€™t own our own names. All of the crucial namespaces belong to centralized entities who control the namespaces and take that control away from you. This is true for all significant namespaces today - the ICANN namespace, Facebook, Twitter, and Google.</p>

<p>As a result, your name on the internet does not belong to you, but rather to the owners of these centralized namespaces.  With a stroke of the keyboard, they can remove anyone from existence.  If your name lives on a centralized namespace, your right to exist effectively belongs to someone else.</p>

<p>Centralized namespaces also determine much more than a userâ€™s ability to exist. They also decree a userâ€™s ability to search, match, and communicate with others. They unilaterally set the framework for what protocols can be used, which use cases are permitted, and what information can flow.</p>

<p>The power to enforce monopolies with little consequence also makes these centralized namespaces some of the most valuable properties on the internet today. Verisign makes billions a year controlling .com with practically zero innovation, while ICANN has the power to arbitrarily raise price caps of entire TLDs with their pet cartel companies. Facebook and Twitter controls exactly how users can use their names/accounts, and can heedlessly cancel pages and remove identities for barely specified reasons.</p>

<p>Everywhere we see, we are seeing the serious dangers of depending on centralized entities to exist and be found by others. The Internet is supposed to be kingless, but the ability to strike away oneâ€™s existence and control exactly how the name is to be used makes the owners of these namespaces the de-facto kings/governors of the internet.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-needs-a-decentralized-namespace">The World Needs a Decentralized Namespace</h2>

<p>Of course, the ability of these centralized namespace owners to control digital existence, lockout access, and enforce monopolistic economics is the complete opposite goal of the decentralized web, which is the ability to exist, innovate, and create their own business models without the need for centralized control or systems.</p>

<p>Whether itâ€™s decentralized currencies, decentralized file systems, or decentralized servers - if these decentralized entities do not live on a widely used namespace, they simply do not exist to the vast majority of users on the internet.</p>

<p><em>Without a decentralized namespace widely readable by humans and resolvable by machines, it is impossible for the decentralized world to be widely adopted by users</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for a Decentralized Naming System</strong></p>

<p>Naming systems play a crucial role in discovery, connection and identification. As one of the most fundamental and long-lasting components of the internet backbone infrastructure, the bar needs to be set very high in terms of longevity, stability, and technical scalability.</p>

<p>For a decentralized naming system to become the legitimate namespace for the decentralized world, the bar is even higher. Without a centralized body in charge, the world has to trust that this naming system will exist in a stable state for a long time to come and stay relevant regardless of potential upheavals and technological progress.</p>

<p>As such, this naming systemâ€™s fundamental construction needs to have certain key technical, social, and governance requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Be truly decentralized</strong>: what is the point of a decentralized naming system if it remains controlled by a small set of people?</li>
  <li><strong>Main key focus as a naming system</strong>: naming systems need to be extremely focused and fast. Can you imagine the DNS system operating reliably if it was also designed for delivering 4K video?</li>
  <li><strong>Be as accessible yet trustless as possible</strong>: anyone should be able to access the namespace directly in a fully trustless manner without intensive resources</li>
  <li><strong>Compatible with the rest of the internet</strong>: allowing for seamless usage with the rest of the application, user, and technical stack</li>
  <li><strong>Stability and upgradability at the protocol level</strong>: allowing for innovation moving forward without disrupting regular operations</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="handshake-design">Handshake Design</h2>

<p>Given these objectives, and with the general goal of the decentralized root zone and certificate authority, Handshake is the only naming system that is fundamentally suitable to be the namespace for decentralized web.</p>

<h3 id="1-focus-as-a-naming-system">1. Focus as a Naming System</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s consider the inherent complexity of an internet-scale naming system. For reference, the naming layer (DNS), unlike the other layers of the internet stack, is the only layer that is a system and not a protocol - the key difference between the two is that a protocol cannot enforce uniqueness of names, which is essential to a functioning namespace. Itâ€™s also arguably by far the most complex layer with many competing technical, political, and economical demands.</p>

<p>As a standalone blockchain, Handshake has room to grow all on its own and govern itself without interfering with other projects or having to compete with different priorities with other use cases (like gaming or DeFi) trying to run in parallel on the same network. In addition, there are several fundamental constraints in other blockchains - for example, Bitcoin limited OP sizes and Ethereumâ€™s notoriously hard to sync blockchain.</p>

<p>If Handshake is built on another blockchain, the instability caused by these competing priorities for use cases and political interests also eliminates one of the core requirements for a decentralized naming infrastructure - which is stability. A naming infrastructure needs to be highly stable - remember - both users, hosts and developers need to be confident that the names will be around for a long time in the same format. For instance, Ethereumâ€™s sky high gas prices due to DeFi and the complex migration to ETH2 are both creating high levels of certainty around how apps will work in the future, and whether retail users will be able to have the same level of access as large ticket users.</p>

<p>Lastly, creating a native auction system is complicated and requires highly specific primitives, such as making coins unspendable for certain periods, and increases the complexity of the system if HNS is a non-native token.</p>

<h3 id="2-decentralization">2. Decentralization</h3>

<p>The other critical consideration is decentralization. <em>Remember, the goal here is to achieve a truly decentralized, uncensorable namespace independent of centralized control and policies. Anything less than will be completely redundant.</em></p>

<p>Ethereum is the most decentralized smart contract platform of date, but itâ€™s still insufficient as a base layer blockchain for a truly decentralized naming system. A system based on Ethereum either would have to be strictly immutable or engineer a governance mechanism with a single or multiple signers. For example, the ENS system on Ethereum has a 7-part multisig making it either censorable and shutting it off to any future innovations or upgrades. These mechanisms either risk shutting off future innovations or donâ€™t meet the decentralized requirement.</p>

<p>How about sidechains? Sidechains mostly rely on the main chainâ€™s security, which makes them completely subject to the same concerns above in terms of sharing priorities with the main chain. In addition, there is currently no such thing as a decentralized side-chain on Bitcoin. Counterparty is a one-way system, Liquid requires a small federated multisig, and Rootstock is currently federated waiting on Drivechain support from Bitcoin.</p>

<p>For all of PoWâ€™s issues, namely with the limited number of miners, it is built on competition which is inherently decentralized as well as clear separation of concerns between developers, users, and miners. This is in contrast to PoS which encourages stakeholders to collude and centralize, creating a largely plutocratic environment.</p>

<p>As such, true naming decentralization with the ability to upgrade is likely best achieved on a standalone PoW chain with robust hash power, a strong ecosystem, and miner confidence in the value of the blockchain.</p>

<h3 id="3-ease-of-trustless-resolution">3. Ease of Trustless Resolution</h3>

<p>Compared to other naming blockchains, _the entire Handshake stack is engineered for the use case of creating a human readable, truly decentralized, fully accessible and secure namespace. _</p>

<p>The naming data in Handshake is stored in a novel data structure called an Urkel Tree,  which was designed specifically for this purpose. The proofs are small and verify quickly, allowing name resolution to happen with very little computation.</p>

<p>Secondly, a highly unique application called HNSD written in C only handles the DNS functions of Handshake (avoiding …</p></div>

      <p>by Jacob Heun &amp; Adin Schmahmann on 2020-09-24</p>

      

      

<p>In August we announced the <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/">deprecation of the SECIO security transport</a>. In this release we have disabled SECIO by default, which will have an impact on older nodes on the network. The best way to mitigate the impact of this change is to <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/recent-releases/go-ipfs-0-7/update-procedure">upgrade your IPFS nodes</a> as soon as possible! Not only will upgrading ensure you’re using the latest security transports, you’ll get access to all of the <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-07-20-dht-deep-dive/">performance improvements</a> we’ve made this year to content routing.</p>

<p>With this release you will also start seeing more Peer IDs and IPNS Keys on the network that start with <code>1</code> instead of the typical <code>Qm</code>. This is due to a switch to ed25519 keys being used by default over RSA keys, which you can read more about in the highlights below.</p>

<p>🚨 For those of you using plugins with IPFS there is a breaking change detailed below to the build process.</p>



<h2 id="secio-is-now-disabled-by-default">🔒 SECIO is now disabled by default</h2>

<p>As part of deprecating and removing support for the SECIO security transport, we have disabled it by default. TLS1.3 will remain the default security transport with fallback to Noise. You can read more about the deprecation in the blog post, <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/">https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/</a>. If you’re running Go IPFS older than 0.5 or JS IPFS older than 0.47, this may start to impact your performance on the public network, so we strongly encourage you to upgrade today!</p>

<h2 id="ed25519-keys-are-now-used-by-default">🗝️ Ed25519 keys are now used by default</h2>

<p>Previously go-ipfs generated 2048 bit RSA keys for new nodes, but it will now use ed25519 keys by default. This will not affect any existing keys, but newly created keys will be ed25519 by default. The main benefit of using ed25519 keys over RSA is that ed25519 keys have an inline public key. This means that someone only needs your PeerId to verify things you’ve signed, such as your Peer Records or in the future Signed Provider Records, which means we don’t have to worry about storing bulky RSA public keys.</p>

<h3 id="rotating-keys">Rotating keys</h3>

<p>Along with switching the default key type, we’ve added support for rotating Identity keys. If you would like to change the key type of your IPFS node, you can now do so with the rotate command. <strong>NOTE: This will affect your Peer Id, so be sure you want to do this!</strong> Your existing identity key will be backed up in the Keystore so that it can still be referenced for things like IPNS records.</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs key rotate -o my-old-key -t ed25519
</code></pre>

<h2 id="key-export-import">📦 Key export/import</h2>

<p>Speaking of backing up keys, we’ve added commands to allow you to export and import keys from the IPFS Keystore to a local .key file. This does not currently apply to the IPFS identity key, <code>self</code>, which is housed in the configuration file.</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs key gen mykey
$ ipfs key export -o mykey.key mykey # ./&lt;name&gt;.key is the default path
$ ipfs key import mykey mykey.key # on another node
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ipns-paths-now-encode-the-key-name-as-a-base36-cidv1-by-default">#️⃣ IPNS paths now encode the key name as a base36 CIDv1 by default</h2>

<p>Previously go-ipfs encoded the key names for IPNS paths as base58btc multihashes (e.g. <code>Qmabc...</code>). We now encode them as base36 encoded CIDv1s as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md#string-representation">peerID spec</a> (e.g. <code>k51xyz...</code>) which also deals with the encoding of public keys. This is nice because it means that IPNS keys will by default be case-insensitive and that they will fit into DNS labels (e.g. <code>k51xyz...ipns.localhost</code>) and therefore that subdomain gateway redirections (e.g. from <code>localhost:8080/ipns/{key}</code> to <code>{key}.ipns.localhost</code>) will look better to users in the default case.</p>

<p>Many commands will accept a <code>--ipns-base</code> option that allows changing command outputs to use a particular encoding (i.e.  base58btc multihash, or CIDv1 encoded in any supported base):</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs key list -l --ipns-base b58mh
12D3KooWCjhz69LskTZEC5vFWs8eDpHo7kYbGzrC5EjU75BHSmVK self
$ ipfs key list -l --ipns-base base36
k51qzi5uqu5dh9ihj4p2v5sl3hxvv27ryx2w0xrsv6jmmqi91t9xp8p9kaipc2 self
</code></pre>

<h2 id="multiaddresses-now-accept-peerids-encoded-as-cidv1">📮 Multiaddresses now accept PeerIDs encoded as CIDv1</h2>

<p>In preparation for eventually changing the default PeerID representation multiaddresses can now contain strings like <code>/p2p/k51xyz...</code> in addition to the default <code>/p2p/Qmabc...</code>. There is a corresponding <code>--peerid-base</code> option to many functions that output peerIDs:</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs id --format "&lt;id&gt;" --peerid-base b58mh
12D3KooWCjhz69LskTZEC5vFWs8eDpHo7kYbGzrC5EjU75BHSmVK
$ ipfs id --format "&lt;id&gt;" --peerid-base base36
k51qzi5uqu5dh9ihj4p2v5sl3hxvv27ryx2w0xrsv6jmmqi91t9xp8p9kaipc2
</code></pre>

<h2 id="dag-stat-command">🧮 <code>dag stat</code> command</h2>

<p>Initial support has been added for the <code>ipfs dag stat</code> command. Running this command will traverse the DAG for the given root CID and report statistics. By default, progress will be shown as the DAG is traversed. Supported statistics currently include DAG size and number of blocks.</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs dag stat bafybeihpetclqvwb4qnmumvcn7nh4pxrtugrlpw4jgjpqicdxsv7opdm6e # the IPFS webui
Size: 30362191, NumBlocks: 346
</code></pre>

<h2 id="plugin-build-changes">🚨 Plugin build changes 🚨</h2>

<p>We have changed the build flags used by the official binary distributions on <a href="https://dist.ipfs.io/">dist.ipfs.io</a> (or <code>/ipns/dist.ipfs.io</code>) to use the simpler and more reliable <code>-trimpath</code> flag instead of the more complicated and brittle <code>-asmflags=all=-trimpath="$(GOPATH)" -gcflags=all=-trimpath="$(GOPATH)"</code> flags, however the build flags used by default in go-ipfs remain the same.</p>

<p>The scripts in <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-example-plugin">go-ipfs-example-plugin</a> have been updated to reflect this change. This is a <strong>breaking change</strong> to how people have been building plugins against the dist.ipfs.io binary of go-ipfs and plugins should update their build processes accordingly. See <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-example-plugin/pull/9">go-ipfs-example-plugin/pull/9</a> for details.</p>

September 24, 2020 | https://welearncode.com/most-important-nonprogramming/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://welearncode.com/most-important-nonprogramming/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://welearncode.com/">← Home</a></p><p>When I think about who I would like to work with as a programmer, I think so much more about non-technical skills than technical skills that make somebody a good co-worker. In fact, all of the skills that are in this post contribute to writing good code that improves technical projects. Most of them are really helpful for careers outside of programming too, but I'm going to focus on why they're useful for programmers specifically.</p><h2>Empathy</h2><p>To build a great product, you must put yourself in the shoes of your users. How will they be using your product? What features will be helpful for them? How can your program help them or improve their lives? And -- conversely -- how could it harm them or negatively impact their lives? What are the ethical implications of your application?</p><p>Empathy is essential for so many pieces of your programs -- if they aren't secure then your user's information could be used negatively by a third party. If they aren't accessible, then you are limiting the number of people that can use your project. If they run slowly or needs huge amounts of bandwidth to run, then users will leave and people in areas with slow internet or mobile users won't be able to run them. It seems like every day an article comes out with some harmful algorithm a company has implemented, like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/18/report-youtubes-alternative-influence-network-breeds-rightwing-radicalisation">YouTube algorithm radicalizing the alt-right</a>, <a href="https://www.inc.com/guadalupe-gonzalez/amazon-artificial-intelligence-ai-hiring-tool-hr.html">Amazon creating a sexist hiring algorithm (which they didn't end up using)</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxuyfWoVV98">AI misgendering black women</a>. Think about everybody when you are writing your code!</p><p>Also, empathy is helpful for being a team member and a mentor. Put yourself in your manager or another developer's shoes. Why are they making their decisions? What can you do to help them? Having empathy will definitely improve your ability to be an effective teammate. If you're an employer, you can retain your employees for longer, and they will be more effective workers if you display empathy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhigginbottom/2018/05/31/why-empathy-matters-in-the-workplace/#386ca65d1130">(src)</a>.</p><p>Have patience for other programmers, especially ones that are learning new things. Remind yourself of something that was really hard for you to learn and how that felt. They probably feel similarly. Being rude to them, diminishing their progress, or being pedantic will only be harmful and make that process harder for them.</p><p><strong>Your words and actions have real consequences -- you can use that to enact positive change or hurt somebody. That doesn't end with in-person communication -- online communication counts too. You may think you're being funny or just letting off steam, but you may actually causing a very negative impact on someone's life. It's up to you to decide how to act, and how to apologize if you hurt someone to undo some of that harm.</strong></p><h2>Problem Solving</h2><p>When I teach people to code, I see a lot more people struggling with problem-solving than the code itself. The ability to break a problem into smaller ones and then solve all of those smaller problems takes a lot of practice. Getting good at problem-solving can help you become a much stronger programmer.</p><p>Also, for most problems, there will be more than one solution. A large part of our jobs as software developers is to think through those different solutions and choose the one that is best. Is one faster to implement? Or does it run more efficiently? Or will it be less expensive? All of these are important questions, and picking the correct solution is a challenging but important part of software development.</p><h2>Collaboration</h2><p>Chances are very high that you with other people as a programmer. You will have to work with other developers, business people, managers, open source contributors, stakeholders, and countless other people even if you are a freelancer or entrepreneur. Learning how to work well with different people and their personalities is critical.</p><p>There are so many things that contribute to good collaboration. The first is knowing that one person can't do everything, or at least do everything well. Different people have different skills, points of view, and life experiences that are more powerful in combination than isolation. Don't feel like you always need to "put the team on your back" or be everything to everybody. You can be a lot better if you allow other people to contribute too.</p><p>Ask other people for help, and be willing to help people in return. You don't need to be an expert in everything, and different people will be experts in different things. Rely on other people, and if you are stuck on something make sure to ask for help so that you don't stay stuck for too long. When somebody asks you for help, be willing to help them. You can learn a lot by explaining things well, and you will be able to reinforce your knowledge of the topic. If you're in a management position, make sure to give people time for mentorship and effective collaboration!</p><p>Along the same lines, don't talk over people or immediately dismiss their viewpoints. They will probably be much less likely to contribute in the future if their opinions aren't valued or taken into account. Actively listen when people share their ideas -- instead of thinking about your response or why your idea is better while they are talking, try to think about why their approach is also good or how it could be implemented.</p><p>Then, once you implement their awesome ideas, give them credit for those ideas. Nothing has made me less effective as an employee as being on a team where my ideas were dismissed, under-valued, and un-credited by other people on my team.</p><h2>Communication</h2><p>When you are working with other people, whether those people are co-workers, clients, the people who use your projects, managers, or people you manage, good communication is crucial. Give honest updates on how things are going, where projects currently stand, and your opinions on things honestly but kindly. People will be less receptive to feedback if you are rude or unconstructive. But, if you are dishonest or sugar-coat the truth, then you may not see a positive change. There's definitely a fine line here.</p><p>One real life example from my life: I had somebody who read one of my blog posts write a very long letter about how dumb I sound because of the tone I take. I usually use a lot of exclamation points and try to sound exciting in my posts -- and that's very intentional to try and make topics that can be intimidating or boring more fun. The person got pretty sexist in this email and said some pretty hurtful things. That being said, I probably could scale back on the exclamation points and still get people excited about programming. I would have been a lot more receptive to that point if the person had framed the criticism more constructively.</p><p>If things are not going well, make sure to say so. Be honest about needing a deadline pushed back, or how something isn't going well at work. You will have a much better chance at changing it and making the environment better for yourself if you speak up.</p><h2>Inclusiveness</h2><p>I used to work as a rock climbing instructor and counselor at a summer camp, and the age group I worked with most were middle school girls. They were some of my favorite people I've ever worked with, but, that being said, middle schoolers aren't usually the most accepting of difference or that clique-adverse. We used to run a game where we started out in one large circle, and then one counselor would tell people they were "out of the circle", and they would have to leave the game based on some characteristic that they weren't informed of and couldn't control. The people still inside the circle would play a game, and the people outside of the circle were excluded and just had to watch from afar.</p><p>This activity was super effective in showing these girls what it was like to be left out for reasons outside of your control, and I still think back on it a lot. As adults, we still leave people out of the circle and exclude them based on certain characteristics outside their control, but if we let them back into the circle and allow them to contribute then our products draw on more diverse experiences and are better. <strong>There's <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">a lot of research</a> on more diverse teams performing better, but from an individual perspective, think about what it feels like to be left out of the circle and try to make your circle larger, not smaller.</strong> Chances are, a lot of your users may be people that have traditionally been left out of the circle in tech. I can tell you from my own experience, that it's really difficult to be the only person like you on a team as someone who's been on a team with another woman for ~5% of my programming career.</p><p>This also links into empathy -- make sure that you are making your programs for a wide variety of users. Not just the able-bodied or those with cutting-edge internet or technologies. You will be able to reach more people.</p><h2>Patience</h2><p>The first person that you need to have patience with when you are programming is yourself. <strong>Programming is hard</strong> and sometimes you will have bugs or difficult problems to overcome. If it's always easy, then you aren't challenging yourself, and you aren't growing as a programmer. Have the tenacity to keep working through a problem and not give up when it gets hard. But, also, know that you can take a break and come back to the problem in a little while. Maybe taking a break will help you solve the problem more efficiently or to see it differently when you come back to it.</p><p>Also, be patient with other people. Things can take a while to learn and people are not perfect. Making mistakes and failing can be some of the most important experiences in the learning process, so allow for that instead of creating an environment where it isn't safe to take risks or grow. Understand that different things click more easily for different people, and know that learning can take a while.</p><h2>Creativity</h2><p>My favorite thing about being a programmer is that I get to use my creative energy to build things that other people can then benefit from. You get to think outside of the box to create really cool things.</p><p>Having creative ideas is important for coming up with …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ca2563ba93dc6cf1ddae"><div><p>Shift, manage and monitor your herd remotely - we’ve summed it up fairly concisely, but how we do that may require a little more paper and a sharpening of the pencil. How are we able to shift a cow to and from the milk shed with the click of a button? Essentially, we train cows to respond to sensory cues which help them understand where they can and cannot go, a method based on the theory of Pavlovian Conditioning. Now, it’s likely your list of questions is long, so we’ve brought in our Head of Rural, Chris, who oversees all on farm training to give you some answers.</p><p><strong>You say that you use sensory cues to guide cows… how does that work?</strong></p><p>Like any animal, cows learn behaviours through the use of positive and negative reinforcement. This technique is commonly known as Pavlovian Conditioning, whereby certain stimuli such as sounds, touches and smells are paired with a conditioned response in order to elicit a desired behaviour.</p><p>If you think about the way we farm today, farmers use a multitude of different cues to shift cows or keep them in a particular zone. To put it really simply, Halter replicates these cues and places them on a collar in the form of sound and vibration. </p><p>Vibration can be seen as a positive reinforcer, enabling us to shift cows around the farm as well as indicating to a cow that she is moving in the right direction. You might like to think of vibration as a farmer walking behind their cows to shift them up to the shed! Sound on the other hand helps a cow understand she is moving in the wrong direction or outside of the allocated zone. Currently on the farm an electric fence is the only real means available for farmers to keep their cows within a particular boundary; we instead use sound to replicate a fence line with a pulse used during the initial training period to help a cow understand the meaning of sound. Once the girls are trained we combine sound cues with vibration and we have the ability to guide cows around a farm, keep them out of waterways and set up virtual paddocks and break fences.</p><p><strong>How quick is the training process? Do all cows learn or do some just not get it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cows are extremely quick to respond to sound, within a couple hours of wearing a collar cows learn to stay within a static boundary. It takes a little longer for them to associate vibration with positive cues, however we are currently seeing this happen within a week. In general onboarding takes a week, however this process is continually being modified and improved.</p><p>To date we haven’t come across any cows that we couldn’t train! Some learn faster than others but due to the fact that cows are herd animals, the slower ones tend to follow and learn from the faster cows.</p><p><strong>How do you ensure that the training is safe and ethical?</strong></p><p>We’ve been working with animal ethics committees from the start and continue to work closely with them, along with vets and professors in this domain. Welfare is our top priority and our founding vision is to unlock the connection between animals and humans to create a better world, with the hope of not only improving the welfare of cows but other animals in the future. </p><p>We are employing a number of systems to ensure our technology is never harmful to a cow, for instance we have hardcoded mechanisms in place that will shut down a collar should anything out of the ordinary happen, for example a cow getting spooked. We have also considered the training process itself and will begin training softly until a cow becomes more comfortable. </p><p>We want to dramatically improve the welfare of cows and will never compromise their wellbeing.</p><p><strong>Will Halter work on other livestock like sheep and beef cattle? And what about calves?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. Beef cattle would be simple - it just requires a slight change in use case. Sheep would require a collar redesign to fit their small fluffy necks and, no, they are not too stupid! I am confident that the fundamental techniques will work on pretty much any mammal. Pavlovian conditioning is a concept that appeals to very basic animalistic instincts that all mammals, and most likely many other types of animals share.</p><p>In terms of calves there is no reason that Halter wouldn’t work for them, we’d just need collars small enough! Although we are currently focused on dairy cattle I see no reason why Halter wouldn’t work on other livestock in the future!</p><p>Setting up a virtual break fence, shifting cows automatically or drafting a single cow with the touch of a button sounds like a rather crazy concept, but we hope this has given you a touch of background and understanding to it all. We’ll leave you to train your dogs, but trust us when we say - we’ve got the cows covered.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <h4>Introduction to managing DB shcema changes with Liquibase</h4>
                <h6>
                    By Suresh Regmi, Published 2020-09-06
                </h6>
    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Let me give you a scenario,<br>
You have a project with multiple database instances in different environments (Dev, QA, Production) and you need to manage the database schema changes that are done against those environments.
Let’s assume that you are managing those changes by creating a git project or a shared file on a drive and adding a new SQL file for each database changes you are doing.
To implement your changes in that database, for each SQL file, you need to run the changes in each environment manually and add a flag or note to indicate which change is run on which environment.<br>
Would it be able to complete your task?
Yes, Yet, is it a decent method to manage schema changes?<br>
Of Course Not.</p>
<h2 id="here-are-some-of-the-many-problems-you-might-face-while-doing-so">Here are some of the many problems you might face while doing so</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hard to synchronize database and application code changes in different environments</li>
<li>The tedious process to run each change manually in different environments</li>
<li>Collaboration across the development team on what change is deployed and what is not</li>
<li>Hard to roll-back to the previous version of the database</li>
<li>Possibility of data loss</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="here-comes-liquibase">Here comes Liquibase</h2>
<p>Liquibase is an open-source library for tracking and managing database schema changes that can be used for any database with a JDBC driver.<br>
It is a platform-independent database migration tool that allows the database changes referred to as ‘changesets’ to be written in various formats including XML, JSON, YAML, and SQL.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>Supports almost all databases that have a JDBC driver.</li>
<li>Changesets can be written in different formats like XML, JSON, YAML, and SQL.</li>
<li>Can be used to automatically generate changesets for an existing database</li>
<li>Easy to integrate with build tools like Jenkins, Maven etc</li>
<li>Supports database rollbacks</li>
<li>Supports context-dependent logic allowing us to use global context and preconditions</li>
<li>Can be executed via command line, Apache Maven, Apache Ant, Spring Framework</li>
<li>Has feature to generate changeset from an existing database and can also generate schema difference as changesets</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="different-ways-to-run-liquibase">Different ways to run liquibase</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embed liquibase with your app:</strong> Embedding liquibase with your application code will automatically deploy liquibase on the app startup.</li>
<li><strong>Run liquibase using build tools:</strong> Integrate liquibase into your build process (with build tools like Jenkins, Ant, Maven, and Gradle) and update them without being tied up with the application.</li>
<li><strong>Generate the SQL and run it manually:</strong> Using update SQL, Liquibase provides the SQL generated from the changeset along with the database changes required to keep the tracking tables up to date. DBA will then inspect the SQL and run them against the database.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installation-process">Installation Process</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Liquibase requires Java 8+</p>
<p>There are two ways to install Liquibase, Manual installation and using liquibase installer.</p>
<p>If you set up liquibase using the liquibase installer, dependencies, directories, config and properties files will all be in place already.
It also provides some examples which will provide you with the core concepts required to understand the changesets.</p>
<p>In the case of manual installation, you need to download the compressed liquibase file and extract it in your workspace.<br>
For windows users, you need to add a new <code>PATH</code> variable in the <code>Environment Variables</code>.<br>
For macOS users, the path should be added to the <code>bash.profile</code> file.</p>
<p>For detailed instruction on Installation please follow this <a href="https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/installation/home.html" target="_blank"> document </a>.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>liquibase.properties:</strong> The file <code>liquibase.properties</code> is a text-based file that stores common properties like database connection parameters, driver details, classpath parameters, global changelog parameters etc.
If you install liquibase using liquibase installer, it will provide pre-written <code>liquibase.properties</code> file while in case of manual installation, you need to create <code>liquibase.properties</code> file using a sample file provided.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>DatabaseChangeLog:</strong> Databasechangelog is a file where all changesets go. Each database changelog can include one or more changesets.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.turtle-techies.com/database-version-controler-with-liquibase/image02.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/database-version-controler-with-liquibase/image02.png" alt="Example of an empty DatabaseChangeLog file
"></a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Changeset:</strong> In liquibase, a changeset is represented as an atomic change to the database. Each changeset should be uniquely identified using author and id fields.

<h2 id="what-if-i-dont-like-liquibase">What if I don’t like Liquibase?</h2>
<p>If you told me that you don’t like liquibase and are looking for alternatives, I would ask why not Liquibase first.<br>
Liquibase is a sophisticated tool for database migration that has all features that you need for professional database refactoring and versioning.</p>
<p>But still, if you don’t want to use liquibase, here are some alternatives.</p>
