<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For someone who has as much experience as me in the task and note management app arenas, I believe I have finally found the tool that will serve me for many years to come. The tool is called <a href="https://obsidian.md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> and it touts itself as being "a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files." For reference, a Markdown file is a text file that is organized in a standardized way. More info can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%20markup,using%20a%20plain%20text%20editor." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. Obsidian allows you to create bidirectional links between your notes. So, instead of having your notes be siloed into different folders and subfolders, you can let your notes be automatically organized based on how they relate to similar topics and points. A lot of people like to use the brain metaphor in that the bidirectional nature resembles how our brains work and how it makes connections with everything that we are thinking and learning about. For reference, here is a screenshot of what my network of notes looked like a few days ago:</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/241280059877739_current-note-network.png"></figure><h3>Roam Research and Why I Stopped Using It</h3><p>Before using Obsidian, I had been using <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Roam Research</a> for about 2 months, starting in April. It calls itself the "notes tool for networked thoughts." Like many others, I was on the hype train and I had it open all day on my computer. It was that good and I understood and supported what Roam Research meant when they replied with the following regarding their planned $15 pricing policy:</p><blockquote>You're not our target user if Roam is worth less than netflix. - Roam Research (@RoamResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1257863780186255364" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">May 5, 2020</a></blockquote><p>While using Roam Research, I had heard of Obsidian as being a comparable but limited alternative, but I didn't try it out until I encountered a hiccup with Roam Research's service towards the end of June. It kept deleting some text that I was trying to enter and it caused me to stop using the service that day. I had also been seeing people that were reporting data loss issues and that pushed me to give Obsidian a try. When you have someone that has made quite a bit of money <a href="https://learn.nateliason.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">from a course</a> on how to properly use Roam Research report data loss, it doesn't ring very well in the trust and reliability departments, especially if you are paying for the service.</p><blockquote>@RoamResearch Roam just froze and deleted everything on a super important page, is there anyway to rollback a page in a database? - Nat Eliason (@nateliason) <a href="https://twitter.com/nateliason/status/1289284989180403712" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">July 31, 2020</a></blockquote><p>I wouldn’t be surprised if the issues that I and other users encountered are because of the approach that Roam Research took when it came to developing their software. On Twitter, Sam Wight describes why he believes it wasn’t a very good one:</p><blockquote>Quick thread on @RoamResearch and *why* their software approach is not a very good one. - Sam Wight (@samwightt) <a href="https://twitter.com/samwightt/status/1271583334041255937" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote><p>I was actually debating whether I would mention these issues. However, as a fellow software craftsman, this is a call for <a href="https://twitter.com/Conaw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Conor</a> and his team at Roam Research to do a better job when it comes to offering a reliable service. I shouldn’t need to set up a <a href="https://medium.com/@quinten_62777/a-step-by-step-guide-to-backing-up-your-roam-research-database-356107fe82ee" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">backup system</a> myself if I’m paying for the service. With them hitting <a href="https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1285337095167291392" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$1 Million in Annual Recurring Revenue</a> within two months of starting to charge, I think they can take the criticism.</p><p>Now, I still wish them success with this endeavor. I'm also looking forward to seeing how much of an impact Roam Research will make in the collective knowledge management and academia <a href="https://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1254546642092474369" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">spaces</a>.</p><h3>My Past History with Task and Note Management Apps</h3><p>For those interested in the apps that I used for task and note management before Obsidian, here you go: (mostly chronological and from what I can remember/find the name of)</p><p><strong>Task management:</strong> Reminders (iPhone), Trello, Google Tasks, Wunderlist, Google Keep, Plan, Asana, Things, Notion, Taskful, Planny, Quire, Habitica, Focus Matrix, Coda, Sorted3, Complice, and Roam Research</p><p><strong>Note management:</strong> Notes (iPhone), Catch, Workflowy, Evernote, Google Keep, Notability, Outlinely, Milanote, Notion, Bear, Slite, and Roam Research</p><h3>My Experience with Obsidian so Far and a Rebuttal</h3><p>Regarding Obsidian, I have been enjoying the experience so far. Obviously, I have lost access to a number of features from Roam Research, i.e. filters, queries, block references (every bullet point you write is a block and you can reference all of them), and editable block embeds. However, I have been able to make do and haven't really missed them. Based on my experience and Obsidian's recent updates, don't let people like Robert Haisfield get you down with their comments:</p><blockquote>If you're using @obsdmd as though it's @RoamResearch, then you get what you pay for. I use both, and both have their strengths, but Obsidian has page level backlinks and no filtering. As soon as you get more than a few linked refs, their backlinks implementation is burdensome - Robert Haisfield (@RobertHaisfield) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1285383798088032257" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote><blockquote>Not trying to call out Justin, it's just that his tour is a visual example of this broader phenomena. Many Roam users will watch it and think to themselves "square peg, round hole" - Robert Haisfield (@RobertHaisfield) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertHaisfield/status/1285385932112187392" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote><p>So, you might be wondering what he is talking about when it comes to linked references and Obsidian's backlinks implementation. In both of the following cases, for each listed reference/mention, you will see the name of the note where the note you are on is referenced and then the context in which it was used.</p><p><strong>Let's start with Roam Research:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/360843078806628_roam%20research%20-%20linked%20refs%20-%20part%201.png"></figure><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/103965367285517_roam%20research%20-%20linked%20refs%20-%20part%202.png"></figure><p>In the first picture, you will see the linked references that are at the bottom of my 🎌 Backlog Tasks note. In the second picture, you will see what happens when I click on the filter button that's to the upper right. This allows you to filter the listed blocks/references.</p><p><strong>Now, let's look at Obsidian:</strong></p><p><u>Note</u>: This is from the most recent Insider build (0.8.4).</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/798287744589004_obsidian%20-%20linked%20refs.png"></figure><p>This is showing the linked mentions for a goal of mine that was related to setting up a tech-focused online social for my hometown. The great thing about this version is that Obsidian has added the ability to see more of the context around the linked mention. Additionally, they have added the ability to collapse linked/unlinked mention results. They don't offer the ability to filter mentions at the moment, but it would make sense for them to eventually add it.</p><p>The solution that's better, at the moment, depends on the type of user you are. If you are a full-time researcher or writer, I can see Roam's approach being more valuable, especially if you want to copy all your past work into it and see what type of connections you can discover. If you are someone that blogs on a casual basis, you probably won't see the lack of linked reference/mention filtering as a deal-breaker. With my workflow that does treat Obsidian like Roam (to a point), I actually haven't missed this feature.</p><p>However, I do see the benefits of it. So, if I don't create it, someone else in the community will make a more extensive backlinks plugin that supports filtering when Obsidian's <a href="https://trello.com/c/Z7qqKVXd/19-public-plugin-api-v10" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">plugin API</a> is released. And, even if the API doesn't include what's needed to do this, Obsidian will be incentivized to add this feature themselves if there's enough of a demand. There's already <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/filtering-everywhere/163" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a post that asks for this feature</a> on their forum.</p><h3>Why I Believe in Obsidian's Future</h3><p>Besides what I have stated above, these are the main reasons why I'm flying the Obsidian banner:</p><p><strong>Future-Proof:</strong> Your notes are future-proof since they use Markdown and not some type of proprietary format.</p><p><strong>Portability:</strong> You don't have to rely on Obsidian's servers in order to access your notes. You can use iCloud, Google Drive, other cloud storage providers, or even roll your own server.</p><p><strong>Safe and Private:</strong> If you use a cloud storage provide to store your notes, you won't have to worry about issues of data loss or your data getting into the wrong hands. I don't think I'm alone in saying that I trust players like Google and Apple more than smaller players (including the app developers themselves) when it comes to the security of my data.</p><p><strong>Extendability:</strong> Obsidian uses 19 core plugins to function and there's more to come. The great thing is that we will be able to install third party plugins and be able to build our own in the future as well. If you keep reading, you will see what type of plugin I have in mind.</p><p><strong>Good mobile experience:</strong> Obsidian doesn't have a mobile app yet. However, with me storing my notes in iCloud, I have easy access to my notes using <a href="https://ia.net/writer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iA Writer</a> on my iPhone. As a side note, if you also have an iPhone, I strongly recommend that you use iCloud to store your notes. I tried to use Google Drive, but I couldn't add new notes without manually moving them from the iCloud area in iA Writer to the Google Drive folder that I was using for my notes.</p><p>Now, let's get into the real meat of this article.</p><h2>Goal Management</h2><p>So, when it comes to managing my goals, I like to break things down. For each of my goals, I break them down into three parts: the overarching goal, the included milestones, and the intentions that are associated with each milestone. Here's a diagram (created using Obsidian via their support for <a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mermaid diagrams</a>):</p><figure><img src="https://cosmonaut-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/600349239113337_goal%20management%20diagram.png"></figure><p>For reference, I got the the term intention from <a href="https://complice.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Complice</a> and intentions are the main way in which I chip away at a goal. A key part of my system is that I like to specify the item's type, title, and whether they have been completed in the item's name. This helps me focus on one item at a time. When it comes to the completion state, I use the "🗙" character for incomplete items, 🚧 for in progress items, ✅ for completed items, and 🚨 for items where my plans have changed and I need to edit them. I add emojis and a dash in the front of goals and milestones. As a way to make my life easier, I use <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alfred's</a> text expansion feature in order to speed up the creation of note titles and their associated contents. At the end of this article, you will find a link to a starter kit/vault that includes all of these, an Alfred workflow, and a vault that follows the Obsidian workflow that is described in this article.</p><p><u>Note</u>: If the above character for incomplete items looks off, this is what it looks …</p></div></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Just before the global shutdown stopped international travel, I remember a Wednesday in January 2020 very well. I drove over to Cerebras Systems one town over in Los Altos, California to<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/our-interview-with-andrew-feldman-ceo-of-cerebras-systems/"> Interview Andrew Feldman</a> the company’s CEO. At Hot Chips 31 (2019) Cerebras was the standout as we covered in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cerebras-wafer-scale-engine-ai-chip-is-largest-ever/">Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine AI chip is Largest Ever</a>. I had the opportunity to first see the system built around the WSE, the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/cerebras-cs-1-wafer-scale-ai-system-at-sc19/">Cerebras CS-1 Wafer-Scale AI System,</a> at SC19. At Hot Chips 32, Cerebras disclosed some details of its new chip the WSE Gen2.<span id="more-46406"></span></p>
<h2>Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine Gen2</h2>
<p>The Cerebras WSE Gen2 offers absolutely huge numbers. For some scale, the Xilinx Versal Premium’s top-end multi-chip package FPGA we covered today, that uses CoWoS to bind together multiple chips, tops out at 92 billion transistors. For GPUs the <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-a100-ampere-resets-the-entire-ai-industry/">NVIDIA A100</a> has around 54 billion transistors. In contrast, the Cerebras WSE Gen2 encompasses 2.6 trillion transistors. That is on a single chip. These are all on 7nm TSMC processes.</p>

<p>This 850 AI optimized core chip is already back at Cerebras headquarters. Likely it is in the same lab we toured earlier this year in Los Altos. This is the only photo we could take from the lab:</p>
<figure id="attachment_40842" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40842"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/our-interview-with-andrew-feldman-ceo-of-cerebras-systems/cerebras-cs-1-3-stack-in-rack/" rel="attachment wp-att-40842"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-CS-1-3-Stack-in-Rack.jpg" alt="Cerebras CS 1 3 Stack In Rack" width="456" height="800" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-CS-1-3-Stack-in-Rack.jpg 456w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-CS-1-3-Stack-in-Rack-171x300.jpg 171w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-CS-1-3-Stack-in-Rack-239x420.jpg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40842">Cerebras CS 1 3 Stack In Rack</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are wondering what that is, it is a fully integrated rack of Cerebras CS-1 systems that are being designed for high-density with cooling and power integrated. Cooling was being provided, in this case, not by air, but by facility water, for the specific customer, it was being designed for. That gives one some sense of the demand that Cerebras is seeing. They are beyond the phase of customers looking for single systems and are moving to customers purchasing many systems and asking for higher integration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_40839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40839"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/our-interview-with-andrew-feldman-ceo-of-cerebras-systems/cerebras-hq-q1-2020-lobby/" rel="attachment wp-att-40839"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby.jpg" alt="Cerebras HQ Q1 2020 Lobby" width="1203" height="876" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby.jpg 1203w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby-400x291.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby-800x583.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby-324x235.jpg 324w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby-696x507.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby-1068x778.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cerebras-HQ-Q1-2020-Lobby-577x420.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 1203px) 100vw, 1203px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-40839">Cerebras HQ Q1 2020 Lobby</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the benefits of the giant WSE structure is that it eliminates an extraordinarily amount of chassis, PCB, cooling, networking, and other components from AI clusters.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine Gen2 is very exciting. Cerebras declined to comment on the amount of SRAM on-chip, but there is a good chance it has scaled with the number of cores. We expect more information is coming later this year. Hopefully, one of these days I will be able to head over to the Cerebras lab again and see the WSE Gen2 in-person to see if the Cerebras lobby skeleton has managed to thrive through the global pandemic.</p>
<p>The big question we have now is will the CS-1 get a WSE Gen2 upgrade, or will we get a CS-2?</p>

pushing forward the state of the art in these fields are appearing every
year. One unintended consequence of all this activity and creativity has been
fragmentation in the fundamental building blocks - multidimensional array
(tensor) and dataframe libraries - that underpin the whole Python data
ecosystem. For example, arrays are fragmented between Tensorflow, PyTorch,
NumPy, CuPy, MXNet, Xarray, Dask, and others. Dataframes are fragmented
between Pandas, PySpark, cuDF, Vaex, Modin, Dask, Ibis, Apache Arrow, and
more. This fragmentation comes with significant costs, from whole libraries
being reimplemented for a different array or dataframe library to end users
having to re-learn APIs and best practices when they move from one framework
to another.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/ecosystem_fragmentation.png" alt="Ecosystem growing up in silos"></p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the Consortium for Python Data API Standards, which
aims to tackle this fragmentation by developing API standards for arrays
(a.k.a. tensors) and dataframes. We aim to grow this Consortium into an
organization where cross-project and cross-ecosystem alignment on APIs, data
exchange mechanisms and other such topics happens. These topics require
coordination and communication to a much larger extent than they require
technical innovation. We aim to facilitate the former, while leaving the
innovating to current and future individual libraries.</p>
<p><em>Want to get started right away? Collect data on your own API usage with</em>
<em><a href="https://github.com/data-apis/python-record-api">python-record-api</a>.</em>
<em>And for array or dataframe maintainers: we want to</em>
<em>hear what you think – see the end of this post.</em></p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-an-organization-and-involving-the-wider-community">Bootstrapping an organization and involving the wider community</h2>
<p>The goal is ambitious, and there are obvious hurdles, such as answering
questions like “what is the impact of a technical decision on each library?”.
There’s a significant amount of engineering and technical writing to do to
create overviews and data that can be used to answer such questions. This
requires dedicated time, and hence funding, in addition to bringing
maintainers of libraries together to provide input and assess those overviews
and data. These factors motivated the following approach to bootstrapping the
Consortium:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assemble a consortium of people from interested companies (who help fund
the required engineering and technical writing time) and key community
contributors.</li>
<li>Form a working group which meets weekly for an hour, sets the high-level
goals, requirements, and user stories, and makes initial decisions.</li>
<li>Several engineers with enough bandwidth will do the heavy lifting on
building the required tooling, and preparing the data and draft docs
needed by the working group. Iterate as needed based on feedback from the
working group.</li>
<li>Once drafts of an API standard have a concrete outline, request input from
a broader group of array and dataframe library maintainers.
<em><span>This is where we are today.</span></em></li>
<li>Once tooling or drafts of the API standards get mature enough for wider review,
release them as Request for Comments (RFC) and have a public review
process. Iterate again as needed.</li>
<li>Once there’s enough buy-in for the RFCs, and it’s clear projects are able
and willing to adopt the proposed APIs, publish a 1.0 version of the
standard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a gradual RFC process is a bit of an experiment. Community projects
like NumPy and Pandas aren’t used to this; however, it’s similar to successful
models in other communities (e.g. the Open Geospatial Consortium, or C++
standardization) and we think the breadth of projects involved and complexity
of the challenge makes this the most promising and likely to succeed approach.
The approach will certainly evolve over time though, based on experience and
feedback from the many stakeholders.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/API_standard_RFC_review_diagram.png" alt="API standard RFC development and community review"></p>
<p>There are other, synergistic activities happening in the ecosystem that are
relevant for this Consortium, that individual members are contributing to,
such as the work on
<a href="https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/master/other_meetings/2020-04-21-array-protocols_discussion_and_notes.md">developing NumPy array protocols</a>,
and the  <code>__dataframe__</code>
<a href="https://github.com/wesm/dataframe-protocol">data interchange protocol design</a>.
The section in the <code>__array_module__</code> NEP on <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0037-array-module.html#requesting-restricted-subsets-of-numpy-s-api">“restricted subsets of NumPy’s API”</a>
gives an outline for how the API standard we’re developing can be adopted.
The <code>__dataframe__</code> protocol attempts to solve a small, well-defined problem
that is a sub-problem of the one a full dataframe API standard would solve.</p>
<h2 id="an-api-standard---what-do-we-mean-by-that">An API standard - what do we mean by that?</h2>
<p>When we start talking about an “API standard” or a formal specification, it’s
important to start by explaining both why we need it and what “API standard”
means. “Standard” is a loaded word, and “standardization” is a process that,
when done right, can have a large impact but may also evoke past experiences
that weren’t always productive.</p>
<p>We can look at an API in multiple levels of detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which functions, classes, class methods and other objects are in it.</li>
<li>What is the signature of each object.</li>
<li>What are the semantics of each object.</li>
</ol>
<p>When talking about <em>compatibility</em> between libraries, e.g. “the Pandas, Dask
and Vaex <code>groupby</code> methods are compatible”, we imply that the respective
dataframe objects all have a <code>groupby</code> method with the same signature and the
same semantics, so they can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Currently, array and dataframe libraries all have similar APIs, but with
enough differences that using them interchangeably isn’t really possible.
Here is a concrete example for a relatively simple function, <code>mean</code>, for
arrays:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All libraries provide this functionality in a function called <code>mean</code>,
except (1) Tensorflow calls it <code>reduce_mean</code> and (2) PyData Sparse has a
<code>mean</code> method instead of a function (it does work with <code>np.mean</code> though via
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.classes.html#special-attributes-and-methods">array protocols</a>).</li>
<li>NumPy, Dask, CuPy, JAX and MXNet have compatible signatures (except the
<code>&lt;no_value&gt;</code> default for <code>keepdims</code>, which really means <code>False</code> but with
different behavior for array subclasses).</li>
<li>The semantics are harder to inspect, but will also have differences. For
example, MXNet documents: <em>This function differs from the original <code>numpy.mean</code>
in the following way(s): - only ndarray is accepted as valid input, python
iterables or scalar is not supported - default data type for integer input is
<code>float32</code></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An API standard will specify function presence with signature, and semantics, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)</code></li>
<li>Computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.</li>
<li>Meaning and detailed behavior of each keyword is explained.</li>
<li>Semantics, including for corner cases (e.g. <code>nan</code>, <code>inf</code>, empty arrays, and
more) are given by a reference test suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantics of a function is a large topic, so the <em>scope</em> of what is
specified must be very clear. For example (this may be specified separately,
as it will be common between many functions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Only array input is in scope, functions may or may not accept lists, tuples
or other object.</li>
<li>Dtypes covered are <code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>float16</code>, <code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>;
extended precision floating point and complex dtypes, datetime and custom
dtypes are out of scope.</li>
<li>Default dtype may be either <code>float32</code> or <code>float64</code>; this is a consistent
library-wide choice (rationale: for deep learning <code>float32</code> is the typical
default, for general numerical computing <code>float64</code> is the default).</li>
<li>Expected results when the input contains <code>nan</code> or <code>inf</code> is in scope,
behavior may vary slightly (e.g. warnings are produced) depending on
implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: all the above is meant to sketch what an “API standard” means, the concrete signatures, semantics and scope may and likely will change</em>.</p>
<h2 id="approach-to-building-up-the-api-standards">Approach to building up the API standards</h2>
<p>The approach we’re taking includes a combination of design discussions,
requirements engineering and data-driven decision making.</p>
<h3 id="start-from-use-cases-and-requirements">Start from use cases and requirements</h3>
<p>Something that’s often missing when an API of a library grows organically
when many people add features and solve their own issues over a time span of
years is <em>requirements engineering</em>. Meaning: start with a well-defined scope
and use cases, derive requirements from those use cases, and then refer to
those use cases and requirements when making individual technical design
decisions. We aim to take such an approach, to end up with a consistent
design and with good, documented rationales for decisions.</p>
<p>We need to carefully define scope, including both goals and non-goals. For
example, while we aim to make array and dataframe libraries compatible so
consumers of those data structures will be able to support multiple of those
libraries, <em>runtime switching</em> without testing or any changes in the
consuming library is not a goal. A concrete example: we aim to make it
possible for scikit-learn to consume CuPy arrays and JAX and PyTorch tensors
from pure Python code (as a first goal; C/C++/Cython is a harder nut to crack),
but we expect that to require some amount of changes and possibly
special-casing in scikit-learn - because specifying every last implementation
detail scikit-learn may be relying on isn’t feasible.</p>
<h3 id="be-conservative-in-choices-made">Be conservative in choices made</h3>
<p>A standard only has value if it’s adhered to widely. So it has to be both
easy to adopt a standard and sensible/uncontroversial to do so.
This implies that we should only attempt to standardize functionality with which
there is already wide experience, and that all libraries either already have
in some form or can implement with a reasonable amount of effort. Therefore,
there …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="what-is-shadow-traffic?"><b>What is Shadow Traffic?</b></h2>
<p>Shadow traffic is visits to your site that are not captured by your typical analytics software provider.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shadow traffic is real traffic from real people, but you won’t have any visibility into them or their behavior. <b>Shadow traffic</b>—real traffic that your analytics misses.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Want Parse.ly to help you understand shadow traffic? </i><i><a href="#form">Sign up for our early-access program</a>.</i></p>
<p>Before you can understand <b>shadow traffic</b>, you need to understand how web, content, and product analytics tools work. Every major analytics tool, including Parse.ly, requires you to add code to your website or app. After this code is added, your analytics provider starts reporting on traffic and events.</p>
<p>When someone visits your website or app, this code sends “events” to your analytics provider. Events are little packets of information that summarize your activity on the site. You are probably most familiar with common web analytics events, such as pageview events, video start events, or email capture events. If events fail to arrive for any reason, such as being stopped by the browser or an adblocker, your analytics provider won’t record anything—not the user, not the session, not the pageview. These visits are still real traffic from real people, but you won’t have any visibility into them or their behavior. This is <b>shadow traffic</b>—real traffic that your analytics misses.</p>

<h2 id="what-causes-shadow-traffic?"><b>What Causes Shadow Traffic? </b></h2>
<p>Shadow traffic is caused by adblockers, browser privacy features, and other tools which stop events from reading your analytics provider. The largest causes of shadow traffic on both web and mobile are adblockers and new privacy features built into browsers. Later on in this article, we’ll discuss the motivation behind adblockers and browser privacy features, which stems from a valid data privacy concern from internet users.</p>
<blockquote><p>The largest causes of shadow traffic on both web and mobile are adblockers and new privacy features built into browsers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite their name, <b>adblockers often block first-party analytics providers, too</b>.

<p>Some advanced internet users also use more advanced privacy tools that are less common causes of shadow traffic. These include:</p>

<h3 id="why-do-users-adopt-adblockers?"><b>Why do users adopt adblockers?</b></h3>
<p>Although every user is different, there are three major motivations driving the adoption of adblockers:</p>
<p><b>1. Preventing third-party personal information leakage: </b>Many advertising networks and vendors took advantage of their relationship with site operators to create “cross-site device graphs” out of users. These device graphs link personal information from one site with behavioral information from another site. Users rightly view this commercial practice as an invasion of privacy and installed adblockers in response. Regulations like GDPR and CCPA were created in part to address this issue on a widespread scale. Installing an adblocker reduces the impact of this commercial practice in your browser.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <b>Avoiding creepy behavioral retargeting:</b><b>&nbsp;</b>Many advertising networks allow their customers to “retarget” users based on a multi-site visit history. For example, they might show you ads for a product you viewed (but did not buy) on Amazon.com in the ad slots for a news/information site you visited days later. Users feel these ads as “creepy” and installed adblockers to break the technology that let them work.</p>
<p><b>3. Improving web page performance: </b>This is probably the top pragmatic reason for the rise of adblockers — improving the end-user performance of most websites. Many sites have ten or twenty different ad networks installed on their sites, and sometimes ad networks deploy other ad networks through a “cascade” of adtech vendors. All of this dramatically slows down site performance and sometimes makes web browsing unbearable.</p>

<p>The reasons listed above might seem like nuisances, but preventing personal information leaks, avoiding poor user experiences, and improving page performance are all core responsibilities of the mainstream browsers and the companies or non-profits behind them (that is, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, among others). Plus, several new browser alternatives, like Brave and Vivaldi, started to grow popular by differentiating on these very features via built-in blocking technology. Thus, this technology — and the end-user benefits — are a permanent part of the “browser wars” we have witnessed over the last several decades, as browser developers build on each others’ work in an effort to win market share.</p>
<p>Unlike third-party adblockers, the blocking technology inside browsers tries very hard to not break web technologies in any dramatic way. They take a different implementation approach and tend to be more conservative in how they work. However, in the last couple of years, spurred on especially by <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/">Safari’s ITP</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop">Mozilla’s ETP</a>, several classes of technology have been blocked to increase user privacy and browser performance. Blocked technology includes social media trackers, cross-site tracking cookies, fingerprinters, and cryptominers. This has generally led to a better web browsing experience for the average user.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-shadow-traffic"><b>The Rise of Shadow Traffic</b></h2>
<p>In 2019, a global <a href="https://www.globalwebindex.com/reports/global-ad-blocking-behavior">study</a> by GlobalWebIndex, <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/ad-blocker-trends-for-2019">cited</a> by IMPACT, concluded that 47% of today’s internet users use some type of blocker. In 2020, Parse.ly began our own research into what proportion of visitors go untracked. Participants in our <a href="#form">early-access program</a> found that at least 20% and up to 40% of traffic was shadow traffic, compared to traditional web analytics tracking.</p>
<p>Missing 20% to 40% of your visitor data leads to misguided decisions, revenue loss, and bad business outcomes. The first step to improving your data quality is addressing shadow traffic, while still fully respecting the valid privacy, user experience, and performance concerns of your audience.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-shadow-traffic"><b>How to Measure Shadow Traffic</b></h2>
<p>Typical analytics tags deployed to your website or app won’t detect shadow traffic. There are workarounds to gain visibility into shadow traffic, but they are difficult to implement and have drawbacks, and all of them require heavy engineering or IT effort.</p>
<h3 id="option-1---consolidated-edge-server-logs"><b>Option 1 – Consolidated Edge Server Logs</b></h3>
<p>When users access your site or app, they interact with your servers. These servers can log user interactions, and then you can visualize this data to gain some insight onto your users. This approach falls apart because reconciling logs from different servers, a CDN, or even multiple sites is effectively impossible, even with server log management software. This tooling is made for developers and the information that matters to them. Content marketers and editors care about <a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/7786/three-ways-value-engaged-time/">engagement</a> and <a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/9156/introducing-conversions/">conversions</a>, not load balancers and server health checks.</p>
<h3 id="option-2---server-side-tracking"><b>Option 2 – Server-Side Tracking</b></h3>
<p>Blocking typically happens within the context of your user’s web browser, but ultimately, users still need to make requests against your servers in order to access your content. If you send first-party analytics events to your analytics provider from your own servers, then you can keep visibility into the user even as the browser might block a request to an analytics service. This option is technically complex, and replicating the intricacies of a robust client-side analytics instrumentation implementation is effectively impossible. You’ll likely miss out on data that should automatically be collected.</p>
<h3 id="option-3---leverage-existing-analytics-services-like-parse-ly"><b>Option 3 – Leverage Existing Analytics Services like Parse.ly</b></h3>
<p>The best option leverages your first-party analytics vendor’s managed service, but in a way where you could still securely access privacy-safe aggregated analytics events. This should span your visible and currently-invisible (shadow) traffic, and maintain respect for a user’s privacy, experience, and performance expectations.</p>

                						<p>Fish market favourites such as orange roughy, common octopus and pink conch are among the species of fish and invertebrates in rapid decline around the world, according to new research.</p>
<p>In the first study of its kind, researchers at UBC, the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel and the University of Western Australia assessed the biomass—the weight of a given population in the water—of more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations. They discovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species.</p>
<p>Of the populations analyzed, 82 per cent were found to be below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields, due to being caught at rates exceeding what can be regrown. Of these, 87 populations were found to be in the “very bad” category, with biomass levels at less than 20 per cent of what is needed to maximize sustainable fishery catches. This also means that fishers are catching less and less fish and invertebrates over time, even if they fish longer and harder.</p>
<p>“This is the first-ever global study of long-term trends in the population biomass of exploited marine fish and invertebrates for all coastal areas on the planet,” said Maria “Deng” Palomares, lead author of the study and manager of the <em>Sea Around Us</em> initiative in UBC’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries.“When we looked at how the populations of major species have been doing in the past 60 years, we discovered that, at present, most of their biomasses are well below the level that can produce optimal catches.”</p>
<p>To reach their findings, the researchers applied computer-intensive stock assessment methods known as CMSY and BSMY to the comprehensive catch data by marine ecosystem reconstructed by the Sea Around Us for the 1950-2014 period.</p>
<p>The greatest declines in stocks were found in the southern temperate and polar Indian Ocean and the southern polar Atlantic Ocean, where populations shrunk by well over 50 per cent since 1950.</p>
<p>While much of globe showed declining trends in fish and invertebrates, the analysis found a few exceptions. One of these was the Northern Pacific Ocean where population biomass increased by 800 per cent in its polar and subpolar zones, and by about 150 per cent in its temperate zone.</p>
<p>Despite these pockets of improvement, the overall picture remains cause for concern, according to co-author Daniel Pauly, principal investigator at <em>Sea Around Us.</em></p>
<p>“Despite the exceptions, our findings support previous suggestions of systematic and widespread overfishing of the coastal and continental shelf waters in much of the world over the last 60-plus years,” said Pauly. “Thus, pathways for improvements in effective fisheries management are needed, and such measures should be driven not only by clearly set total allowable annual catch limits, but also by well-enforced and sizeable no-take marine protected areas to allow stocks to rebuild.”</p>
<p>“Fishery biomass trends of exploited fish populations in marine ecoregions, climatic zones and ocean basins” was published in<em> Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science</em>.</p>

<p><em>Founder</em>: Hey Joe! How are you doing? Everyone here loved meeting you, and we would really love to have you on board as our investor! We really respect your expertise, and think this could be a great partnership. What do you say?</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: Glad to hear! Can you give me more details about how much money you’re looking for, and what I would be getting?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Sure. We’re looking for a $100,000 commitment, and in return, you would be getting 0.1% of the company.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: In order for me to value your company accurately, do you mind sharing your financial books with me?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Unfortunately, we can’t do that. That information is classified.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: You shared them with your earlier investors though?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Yes, but I’m afraid we can’t share it with you.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: Ok. I guess we’ll just have to make do with the valuation from your most recent funding round. Can you share more details about that?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Sure. At our recent round 2 months ago, we were valued at $30M, post-money.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: So, 0.1% of your company works out to $30,000… you’re asking me to commit $100,000 in exchange for $30,000 worth of equity?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: No no no Joe. You’re not looking at it the right way. You can’t just value 0.1% of the company as being worth $30,000. No one has any idea where we’re going to end up in the future. How would you even value an early-stage startup like us anyway?</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: Well clearly you were able to agree on a valuation with your previous investors…</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Yes, but that’s not the right way to approach this Joe. Startup outcomes are completely bimodal. Either we’re going to be successful, in which case your equity will be worth an astounding amount, even though you’re getting so little. Or we’re going to fail, in which case it will be worthless, no matter how much equity you have.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: Well, I’m still concerned about the expected return for the risk I’m taking. And you still haven’t explained why you’re quoting me a valuation that’s so much higher than the valuation that you agreed to with your previous investors.</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Look Joe, we’re looking for someone who believes in us and our vision. Someone who believes that we’re going to be the next unicorn. And when that happens, your $100,000 investment will grow into a cool $1M! Surely that’s a fair return on your investment? If you don’t believe in that vision, and if you aren’t willing to make sacrifices to be part of our team, maybe we don’t want you as our investor.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: Well, I do believe in your vision and want to be a part of it. I just want to get the same amount of preferred stock that your other investors…</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Hold up! Who said anything about preferred stock. I’m afraid only our other investors will be getting preferred stock, not you.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: So you’re both quoting me a higher valuation, <em>and</em> I’ll be getting only common stock?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: Not exactly. You’ll be getting options for common stock, with a strike price set to the company’s current Fair-Market-Value.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: So when you guys eventually get to a liquidity event, I can then exercise these options and make money off them?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: If everything goes well! We’ll need you to continue investing in us, every year, until we get acquired or go IPO. If at any point you decide that you don’t want to continue investing more money, you’ll have 90 days to exercise your options immediately. Otherwise, you’ll lose them forever.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: But that’s so risky! Exercising those options is going to be very expensive, and that’s going to increase my risk even further because the stock is still illiquid! Not to mention that if the startup does become a unicorn like you were saying, I’ll get hit with a massive AMT bill that I won’t even be able to pay!</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves here Joe. That’s all so far away! Who knows what’s going to happen 5 years from now. Most startups don’t grow that much you know. Let’s just finish the deal now, and if the need arises, the board can vote to change the terms of your options in the future.</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: And what if the board chooses not to? What if the startup does grow quite a bit, and I get hit with a huge AMT bill? My money would already be committed by then and I’d be SOL. Can’t you guys just replace this 90-day clause with a 10-year expiry, so that I wouldn’t have to deal with all these risks?</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: I’m afraid we can’t do that for you Joe. Besides, we want investors who are committed to us for the long haul. If you don’t want to keep investing in us for the next 10 years, maybe you don’t deserve to keep your equity. It would be best for everyone if we took away your equity and gave it to the people who are still with us.</p>



<p><em>Founder</em>: … So, what do you say? Can we count on your $100,000?</p>



<p><em>Investor</em>: Yeah… no. I think I’m going to go invest in Google instead.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>If you’re taking a $X pay cut to join a startup, you’re really investing $X in them. Far be it from me to tell you how to spend your money, but make sure you’re happy with what you’re getting in return.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of Explanations is to try to allow people to play with fun parts of computers. Graphics,
            compression, audio. The tagline is my biggest inspiration: "Play, don't show", riffing off the
            typical "Show, don't tell" rule of writers and authors everywhere. Why bother giving a diagram when
            I give you an inspector and let you poke at things yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
            It takes me a long time to write an Explanation, so these might not come out as quick as you like,
            but I do plan on writing these as long as I'm able to. I also don't claim to be the world's expert
            on most everything I'm writing about. I might be wrong! Please let me know by
            <a href="mailto:jstpierre@mecheye.net">email</a> or through
            <a href="https://github.com/magcius/xplain/issues/new">a GitHub issue</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, this series was known as "Xplain" and was more focused on the X11 window system and
            protocol, but I've been slowly moving towards anything that interests me, and I'm hijacking this
            project for it since I really like the format and style I've developed. The code for every single
            one of these demos is available in the
            <a href="https://github.com/magcius/xplain">GitHub repo</a>, and I do try to comment heavily and
            go into even more depth there! Play with the code! Use it for one of your own projects! It's all
            MIT/X11 licensed. I very much appreciate followup questions and any sort of feedback through the
            links mentioned above.

              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

<p>When using the same primitive type (<code>Int</code>, <code>Text</code>, etc.) to represent semantically different entities (name, title, description, etc.).</p>

<div>

<li>Improves maintainability.</li>
<li>Increases code readability.</li>
<li>Enables writing custom instances.</li>
<li>Allows reusing instance definitions with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#deriving-via">DerivingVia</a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>
<li>Deriving boilerplate is required to duplicate existing behaviour of the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<div>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a data type restricts some values (e.g.&nbsp;not every <code>ByteString</code> is a valid <code>Password</code>).</li>
<li>When you want to make construction of big data types easier.</li>
<li>To avoid runtime errors.</li>
<li>To make illegal states unrepresentable.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>More structured and maintainable code.</li>
<li>Separation of concepts.</li>
<li>Control of erroneous data inputs.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some extra code.</li>
<li>Decide on the approach details.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>
<span id="cb10-3">    , mkPassword</span>
<span id="cb10-4">    ) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"></span>
<span id="cb10-6"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Byte…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

"Long-term they will likely add more wind and solar but in the short-term they don't see the need for that extra energy."</p>  <p>"What they do need is that peaking capacity that comes when you can call it and that's the sort of thing we can offer."</p>  <p>VanWalleghem&nbsp;and his colleagues are so convinced in their technology that they're branching out overseas, building a similar facility in Adelaide, Australia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>With the hope that one day, when governments truly go to carbon-free energy sources such as wind and solar, they have a way to store the energy, even when the sun isn't shining.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

    <blockquote>APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.</blockquote>

There will be some innovation and a few compromises, but this combination may pave the way for new and ingenious content.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>As with Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/">previous portable console</a>, the system revolves around a big chip named <strong>CPU NTR</strong>. ‘NTR’ is shorthand for ‘Nitro’, the codename of the original Nintendo DS.</p><p>Now, CPU NTR implements an interesting multi-processor architecture using two different ARM CPUs, this design was done before ARM Holdings officially released multi-processor solutions. So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This section is a bit unusual because not only this console has multiple screens to draw, but also a combination of traditional tile engines working …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    <main role="main">

        
        
<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/header.png">
</p>

<p>
The way I was taught x86 assembly at the university had been completely outdated for many years by the time I had my first class. It was around 2008 or 2009, and 64-bit processors had already started becoming a thing even in my neck of the woods. Meanwhile, we were doing DOS, real-mode, memory segmentation and all the other stuff from the bad old days.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I picked up enough of it during the classes (and over the subsequent years) to be able to understand the stuff coming out of the other end of a compiler, and that has helped me a few times. However, I've never manually written any substantial amount of x86 assembly for something non-trivial. Due to being locked up inside (on account of a global pandemic), I decided to change that situation, to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to focus on x86-64 specifically, and completely forget/skip any and all legacy crap that is no longer relevant for this architecture. After getting a bit deeper into it, I also decided to publish my notes in the form of tutorials on this blog since there seems to be a desire for this type of content.
</p>

<p>
Everything I write in these posts will be a normal, 64-bit, Windows program. We'll be using Windows because that is the OS I'm running on all of my non-work machines, and when you drop down to the level of writing assembly it starts becoming incresingly impossible to ignore the operating system you're running on. I will also try to go as "from scratch" as possible - no libraries, we're only allowed to call out to the operating system and that's it.
</p>

<p>
In this first, introductory part (yeah, I'm planning a series and I know I will regret this later), I will talk about the tools we will need, show how to use them, explain how I generally think about programming in assembly and show how to write what is perhaps the smallest viable Windows program.
</p>

<h2>Getting the Tools</h2>
<p>There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.</p>

<h3>Assembler</h3>

<p>
CPUs execute machine code - an efficient representation of instructions for the processor that is almost completely impenetrable to humans. The assembly language is a human-readable representation of it. A program that converts this symbolic representation into machine code ready to be executed by a CPU is called an <b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is no single, agreed-upon standard for x86-64 assembly language. There are many assemblers out there, and even though some of them share a great deal of similarities, each has its own set of features and quirks. It is therefore important which assembler you choose. In this series, we will be using 
<a href="http://flatassembler.net/">Flat Assembler</a> (or FASM for short). I like it because it's small, easy to obtain and use, has a nice macro system and comes with a handy little editor.</p>

<h3>Debugger</h3>

<p>
Another important tool is the debugger. We'll use it to examine the state of our programs. While I'm pretty sure it's possible to use Visual Studio's integrated debugger for this, I think a standalone debugger is better when all you want to do is look at the disassembly, memory and registers. I've always used <a href="http://ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> for stuff like that, but unfortunately it does not have a 64-bit version. Therefore we will be using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">WinDbg</a>. The version linked here is a revamp of this venerable tool with a slightly nicer interface. Alternatively, you can get the non-Windows-store version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a> as part of the Windows 10 SDK. Just make sure you deselect everything else besides WinDbg during installation. For our purposes, the two versions are mostly interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Assembly</h2>

<p>
Now that we have our tools, I want to spend a bit of time to discuss some basics. For the purpose of these tutorials I'm assuming some knowledge of languages like C or C++, but little or no previous exposure to assembly, therefore many readers will find this stuff familiar.
</p>
<h3>A 10000-foot view</h3>
<p>
CPUs only "know" how to do a fixed number of certain things. When you hear someone talk about an "instruction set", they're referring to the set of things a particular CPU has been designed to do, and the term "instruction" just means "one of the things a CPU can do". Most instructions are parameterized in one way or another, and they're generally really simple. Usually an instruction is somthing along the lines of "write a given 8-bit value to a given location in memory", or "interpreting the values from registers A and B as 16-bit signed integers, multiply them and record the result into register A".
</p>

<p>
Below is a simple mental model of the architecture that we'll start with.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/diag0.png">
</p>

<p>
 This skips a <i>ton</i> of things (there can be more than one core executing instructions and reading/writing memory, there's different levels of cache, etc. etc.), but should serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
 To be effective at low-level programming or debugging you need to understand that every high-level concept eventually maps to this low-level model, and learning how the mapping works will help you.
</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>
 You can think of <b>registers</b> as a special kind of memory built right into the CPU that is very small, but extremely fast to access. There are many different kinds of registers in x86-64, and for now we'll concern ourselves only with the so-called <i>general-purpose</i> registers, of which there are sixteen. Each of them is 64 bits wide, and for each of them the lower byte, word and double-word can be addressed individually (incidentally, 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 bytes, in case you haven't heard this terminology before).
 </p>
 
 <table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td><b>Register</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower byte</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower word</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower dword</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rax</td> <td>al</td> <td>ax</td> <td>eax</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rbx</td> <td>bl</td> <td>bx</td> <td>ebx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rcx</td> <td>cl</td> <td>cx</td> <td>ecx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rdx</td> <td>dl</td> <td>dx</td> <td>edx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rsp</td> <td>spl</td> <td>sp</td> <td>esp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rsi</td> <td>sil</td> <td>si</td> <td>esi</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rdi</td> <td>dil</td> <td>di</td> <td>edi</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rbp</td> <td>bpl</td> <td>bp</td> <td>ebp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r8</td> <td>r8b</td> <td>r8w</td> <td>r8d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r9</td> <td>r9b</td> <td>r9w</td> <td>r9d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r10</td> <td>r10b</td> <td>r10w</td> <td>r10d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r11</td> <td>r11b</td> <td>r11w</td> <td>r11d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r12</td> <td>r12b</td> <td>r12w</td> <td>r12d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r13</td> <td>r13b</td> <td>r13w</td> <td>r13d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r14</td> <td>r14b</td> <td>r14w</td> <td>r14d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r15</td> <td>r15b</td> <td>r15w</td> <td>r15d</td>
 </tr>   
</tbody></table>  

<p>Additionally, the higher 8 bits of <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code> and <code>rdx</code> can be referred to as <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>, <code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code>.</p>

<p>
Note that even though I said those were "general-purpose" registers, some instructions can only be used with certain registers, and some registers have special meaning for certain instructions. In particular, <code>rsp</code> holds the stack pointer (which is used by instructions like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code>), and <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> serve as source and destination index for "string manipulation" instructions. Another example where certain registers get "special treatment" are the multiplication instructions, which require one of the multiplier values to be in the register <code>rax</code>, and write the result into the pair of registers <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these registers, we will also consider the special registers <code>rip</code> and <code>rflags</code>. <code>rip</code> holds the address of the next instruction to execute. It is modified by control flow instructions like <code>call</code> or <code>jmp</code>. <code>rflags</code> holds a bunch of binary flags indicating various aspects of the program's state, such as whether the result of the last arithmetic operation was less, equal or greater than zero. The behavior of many instructions depends on those flags, and many instructions update certain flags as part of their execution. The flags register can also be read and written "wholesale" using special instructions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot more registers on x86-64. Most of them are used for SIMD or floating-point instructions, and we'll not be considering them in this series.
</p>

<h3>Memory and Addresses</h3>

<p>
You can think of memory as a large array of byte-sized "cells", numbered starting at 0. We'll call these numbers "memory addresses". Simple, right?
</p>
<p>
Well... addressing memory used to be rather annoying back in the old days. You see, registers in old x86 processors used to be only 16-bit wide. Sixteen bits is enough to address 64 kilobytes worth of memory, but not more. The hardware was actually capable of using addresses as wide as 20 bits, but you had put a "base" address into a special segment register, and instructions that read or wrote memory would use a 16-bit offset into that segment to obtain the final 20-bit "linear" address. There were separate segment registers for code, data and stack portions (and a few more "extra" ones), and segments could overlap. 
</p>
<p>
In x86-64 these concerns are non-existant. The segment registers for code, data and stack are still present, and they're loaded with some special values, but as a user-space programmer you needn't concern yourself with them. For all intents and purposes you can assume that all segments start at 0 and extend for the entire addressable length of memory. So, as far as we're concerned, on x86-64 our programs see memory as a "flat" contiguous array of bytes, with sequential addresses, starting at 0, just like we said in the beginning of this section...
</p>
<p>
Okay, I may have distorted the truth a little bit. Things aren't quite as simple. While it is true that on 64-bit Windows your programs see memory as a flat contiguous array of bytes with addresses starting at 0, it is actually an elaborate illusion maintained by the OS and CPU working together.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, if you were really able to read and write any byte in memory willy-nilly, you'd stomp all over other programs' code and data (something that indeed could happen in the Bad Old Days). To prevent that, special protection mechanisms exist. I won't get too deep into their inner workings here because this stuff matters mostly for OS developers. Nevertheless, here's a very short overview:
</p>
<p>
Each process gets a "flat" address space as described above (we'll call it the "virtual address space"). For each process, the OS sets up a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">mapping</a> between its virtual addresses and actual physical addresses in memory. This mapping is respected by the hardware: the "virtual" addresses get translated to physical addresses dynamically at runtime. Thus, the same address (e.g. 0x410F119C) can map to two different locations in physical memory for two different processes. This, in a nutshell, is how the separation between processes in enforced.
</p>

<p>
The final thing I want to invite your attention to here is how the instructions and data which they operate on are held in the same …</p></main></div></div>

<p>It seems impossible, however, thanks to a particular initiative that is becoming more and more popular, this can become a reality. The project <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> has sprung from a few Italian municipalities with the intent to counter the population outflow and to give a new birth to troubled areas.<br>
With this operation <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> we try to repopulate gorgeous villages that are being deserted, with the young population leaving and the elderly slowly fading away.</p>
<p>This unprecedented proposal has struggled initially, but it’s gaining popularity in recent times. This long-term strategy is attractive for those who are looking for low-cost real estate investments in Italy, and to simply restore prestige to Italian villages famous all over the world for their extraordinary beauty, and for that vintage spirit so cherished nowadays.</p>
<p>[metaslider id=”207″]
</p><p>Additionally, the <strong>Project Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> could positively shock to the Italian real estate market facilitating access to homes by young people, for whom it is becoming increasingly difficult to take out a mortgage.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the repopulation of these small villages also promotes tourist activities, regenerating the economy of the entire area. To enhance the tourism economy, it is possible to repurpose an old building as a boutique hotel, a B&amp;B, or even to create a bigger project involving multiple premises in the same village to create a scattered hotel.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many very interesting possibilities and implications.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Lately, I’ve been playing around with inventing a visual writing system for lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> (λ-calculus) is a sort of proto-functional-programming, originally invented by Alonzo Church while he was trying to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem">the same problem</a> that led Turing to invent Turing machines. It’s another way of reasoning about computation.</p>

<p>Python’s lambda is an idea that was borrowed from λ-calculus. In Python, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">lambda expression</a> like the following in order to define a function that returns the square of a number:</p>



<p>In λ-calculus, the idea is the same: we create a function by using <code>λ</code> to specify which arguments a function takes in, then we give an expression for the function’s return value. Pure lambda calculus doesn’t include operators of any sort –&nbsp;just functions being applied to other functions –&nbsp;so if we try to write a <code>square</code> function, we have to suppose that <code>multiply</code> is a function of two variables that has already been defined:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square = λx. multiply x x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>square</code> function, once defined, can be applied to arguments and evaluated into something simpler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square 4 = (λx. multiply x x) 4
         = multiply 4 4
         = 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the cool things about lambda calculus is that we can represent most common programming abstractions using λ-calculus, even though it’s nothing but functions: numbers, arithmetic, booleans, lists, if statements, loops, recursion… the list goes on. Before I introduce the visual writing system I’ve been using, let’s take a detour and discuss how we can represent numbers and arithmetic using lambda calculus.</p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-calculus">Church numerals, in lambda calculus</h2>
<p>Alonzo Church figured out how to represent numbers as lambda functions; these numbers are referred to as Church numerals.</p>

<p>We can represent any nonnegative integer as long as we have two things: (1) a value for <strong>zero</strong>, and (2) a <strong>successor</strong> function, which returns <code>n + 1</code> for any number <code>n</code>. To represent numbers as functions, then, we require that <code>z</code> (zero) and <code>s</code> (successor) be passed in as arguments, and go from there. Each number is actually secretly a function of those two inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>zero = λs. λz. z
one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)
three = λs. λz. s (s (s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual details of how to implement zero and successor should be implemented as are left as someone else’s problem — we can survive without them. All we care about is that our numbers do the right thing, given whatever zero and successor someone may provide.</p>

<p>What about <strong>addition</strong>? Addition is a function that takes in two numbers (let’s call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), and produces a number representing their sum. To sum them together, we’ll want to produce a number that applies <code>s</code>, the successor function, a total of <code>x + y</code> times. For example, we could first apply it <code>y</code> times to the zero, then apply it <code>x</code> more times to that result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try proving that one plus one equals two. In λ-calculus, this proof looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)

plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))

plus one one = (λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))) one one
             = λs. λz. one s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s ((λs. λz. s z) s z)
             = λs. λz. s (s z)
             = two
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Long, but at least conciser than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Bertrand Russell’s</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="lambda-circuitry">Lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>There are a lot of lambdas, parentheses, and arguments being pushed around in that proof. Mentally matching up parentheses is annoying. Scope is especially annoying: which <code>s</code> am I looking at again in <code>λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)</code>, the inner one or the outer one?</p>

<p>A linear string of lambdas and parentheses is an ineffective way to provide intuition for the computations that are taking place. This problem isn’t unique to lambda calculus, either; consider trying to represent a binary tree using a linear string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Node(2, Node(7, Leaf(2), Node(6, Leaf(5), Leaf(11))), Node(5, None, Node(9, Leaf(4), None)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unambiguous, but not very intuitive. Contrast that representation with the diagram we use when we’re trying to explain that same binary tree at a chalkboard, a more visual notation:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/288px-Binary_tree.svg.png" alt="Binary tree diagram, from Wikipedia"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_tree.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>I remember programming constructs better when I can reason about them visually like this: when I imagine cutting an array in half for binary search, when I imagine pointers in a linked list being shuffled around to insert a new element, and when I imagine traversing up and down the branches of a binary tree.</p>

<p>Why can’t lambda calculus get some visual intuitions, in the same way? Lambda calculus is a dance of variables flowing through and being manipulated by functions, and I want a writing system for lambda calculus that will visually display this dance. It shouldn’t look like strings of parentheses and symbols: it should create visual intuition.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, here is the system I came up with. I aimed for something that would resemble circuitry.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong> flow along wires, where they may be passed in as arguments to functions or applied as functions themselves. Some are inputs, some are outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> are represented as boxes which are applied to their inputs on one side and produce a single output on the other. The notation must indicate which function is applied; this may either be drawn within the box itself, or wired in to the middle of the box from some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are represented as inputs, coming in from the right side of the diagram; these arguments might pass through functions, or they might be functions-to-apply themselves. If an argument has not been passed in yet, it’s an empty arrow beginning a wire; if an argument has been passed in, its value is attached to the wire. Arguments are always passed in from top to bottom, in order.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a function which takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, then a value <code>x</code>, and returns <code>f (g x)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f-g-x.png" alt="lambda f. lambda g. lambda x. f (g x)"></p>

<p>As another example, here’s the M combinator <code>M = λx. x x</code> (the “mockingbird” in <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em></a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/m-combinator.png" alt="lambda x. x x"></p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-circuitry">Church numerals, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>Here’s the Church numeral <code>four = λs. λz. s (s (s (s z)))</code>, drawn out in lambda circuitry:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-four.png" alt="Four, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Let’s take that proof from earlier that one plus one is two. What does it look like to draw that proof in lambda circuitry, instead?</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-oneplusoneistwo.png" alt="Proof that one plus one is two, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also consider <strong>multiplication</strong>. A multiply function would take in two numbers, m and n, and computes a new number which is their product. In lambda calculus, we’d write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>multiply = λm. λn. λs. λz. m (n s) z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the notation of lambda circuitry, this looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply.png" alt="Multiplication function, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Using this function, we can check that <code>multiply 2 3</code> evaluates to <code>6</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-1.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-2.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-3.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-4.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 4"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-5.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 5"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-de-bruijn-indices">Sidenote: De Bruijn indices</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about lambda circuitry is that it completely removes the need for variable names.</p>

<p>There’s another notation for lambda calculus that does this too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index"><em>De Bruijn indices</em></a>. A lambda expression written with De Bruijn indices indicates which variables are used where with a positive integer; the smaller the integer, the more recently the argument it refers to was passed in.</p>

<p>For example, the identity function <code>λx. x</code> may be written with De Bruijn indices like so:</p>



<p>The Church numeral for two, <code>λs. λz. s (s z)</code>, may be written like so:</p>



<p>The addition function, <code>λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))</code>, may be written like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An evaluation of <code>plus one one</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus one one = (λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1) (λ λ 2 1)
             = (λ (λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 ((λ λ 2 1) 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (2 1)
             = λ λ 2 (2 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the tricky things about writing a lambda calculus interpreter is getting the renaming rules right; De Bruijn indices are convenient because they remove the need for this. Lambda circuitry is similar in spirit to De Bruijn indices in that it doesn’t require variable names at all, but instead indicates which variables are passed where by connecting values directly to an arrow indicating when they were passed in.</p>

<h2 id="argument-switching-function-in-lambda-circuitry">Argument-switching function, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>I’ll provide more examples just to further demonstrate how the notation works in different situations. Let’s consider the “argument-switching” function <code>C</code>, where <code>C f x y</code> returns <code>f y x</code>. (This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system">C combinator</a>.)</p>



<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator.png" alt="C combinator"></p>

<p>Suppose we try applying this to a silly function <code>f</code> where <code>f x y</code> discards <code>y</code> and just returns <code>x</code>. Then, <code>C f</code> should switch around <code>f</code>‘s arguments and create a function which returns <code>y</code> instead. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = λx. λy. x

C f = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) f
    = λx. λy. f y x
    = λx. λy. (λx. λy. x) y x
    = λx. λy. y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f.png" alt="f = lambda x. lambda y. x"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-1.png" alt="C(f), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-2.png" alt="C(f), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-3.png" alt="C(f), step 3"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also try a function <code>g</code> where <code>g x y</code> returns <code>x y</code>. Then <code>C g x y</code> should return <code>y x</code>. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g = λx. λy. x y

C g x y = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) g x y
        = g y x
        = (λx. λy. x y) y x
        = y x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-g.png" alt="g = lambda x. lambda y. x(y)"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-1.png" alt="C(g), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-2.png" alt="C(g), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-3.png" alt="C(g), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-g-4.png" alt="C(g), step 4"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p><em>Exercise</em>: Show that applying <code>C</code> twice reverses it. That is, show that <code>C (C f)</code> returns <code>f</code>, for any <code>f</code>.
(Note that <code>C f</code> is a function which takes in two arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and returns <code>f y x</code>. Applying <code>C</code> only to <code>f</code> like this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="prior-work">Prior work</h2>
<p>There are some other systems that give visual intuition to lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/"><em>To Dissect a Mockingbird</em></a> describes a notation that is actually very similar to the one I’ve described, and demonstrates it on various problems from <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>. I like the way this looks, especially how every function is enclosed by two halves of a circle which make it obvious how that function might be applied. My notation doesn’t have this feature, but requires drawing fewer enclosing boxes as a result.</p>

<p>Visual Lambda (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/visual-lambda/">code</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/visual_lambda_bubble_notation.gif">basics</a>, <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">paper</a>) represents lambda expressions as colored bubbles, and provides an interface for manipulating them.</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/">Alligator Eggs</a> is a description of a puzzle game based on lambda calculus, which also happens to provide a visual way of working with and evaluating lambda expressions.</p>

                and London. The bots often tweet about news and fire aircraft, and because they use an uncensored source
                of data they also tweet police, FBI, DHS, DEA, CBP, and military
                aircraft. They look for circles because it means an aircraft is <i>doing something</i> instead of
                <i>going somewhere</i>. If you've ever asked “what is that helicopter/plane?” there’s a good chance my

                This week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI is regularly flying “spy planes” over American
                cities.

                The report, which revealed the front companies the FBI uses to fly the planes, wasn’t a surprise to John
                Wiseman, a technologist in Los Angeles. Based on public records, he had already figured out some of the
                planes the FBI was flying and, using a
                device he programmed to intercept airplane transmissions, had identified over the last month the ones
                flying overhead in L.A. in real time.
                Wiseman wrote in a Hacker News comment in May about his findings, revealing a month ago what the AP
                reported today.

                I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1238149529469202433">Siri shortcut</a> that
                lets you ask what's overhead at any time, and it will tell you what
                the nearest aircraft is and who it's registered to. It uses the same uncensored data source as
                the Advisory Circular bots.

            </div>
            <p>Oddly, I don't remember when or how I got my hands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/">Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em></a> card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Imaginging that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.</p>
              <p>However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Digging into the <em>FlashAir</em></h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">wireless access point (WAP)</a>. You can setup a custom SSID and password— connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.</p>
              <p>After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static website— served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled <em>Dark Rooms</em>, was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/">Mona Mahall</a>. The studio was split into three exhibitions: <em>Pyramid, Server and Backstage</em>. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".</p>
              <p>In the second exhibition, <em>Server</em>, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human space— a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like <a target="_target" href="https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/">Adam Bartholl</a>.</p>
              <p>His project, a USB "<a target="_blank" href="http://deaddrops.com/">dead drop</a>", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret location— such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other object— would be used to discreetly stash an important item.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Once the item— perhaps a slip of paper or a key— is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Wireless Anonymous Repository</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the <em>FlashAir</em> cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.</p>
              <p>Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. If— in the spirit of the original USB dead drop— you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>I named the project <em>warTOR</em> for "wireless anonymous repo" + <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>. Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some Pokémon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards <em>can</em> be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.</p>
              <p>With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a café and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.</p>
            </div>

              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Here are some screenshots from the application 👆. I'll be doing a follow-up post with a GitHub link to the <em>FlashAir</em> CONFIG file that I'm using on my card. I'll also upload the source code for the original <em>warTOR</em> server with instructions on how you can deploy your own <em>warTOR</em> in the wild!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study has found that 13% of people think of themselves as pathological liars, or say that others consider them to be pathological liars. Those 13% reported telling about 10 lies per day.</p><p>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#.XvDDrEQ2jzE%20">Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice</a>,&nbsp;included 623 people. The researchers recruited them in 2019 from various mental health forums, social media, and a university.</p><p>The participants spanned a range of ages, ethnicities, education levels, and income levels. The researchers asked them whether they thought of themselves as pathological liars, or if others thought of them that way. The respondents also took a lie frequency assessment and other questionnaires.</p><h2>Greater distress and impaired functioning</h2><p>The study found the pathological liars were more likely to experience distress and impaired functioning, especially in social relationships. This diminished functioning also applied to legal contexts, work, and finances. Their distress often had to do with worries about whether their lies would be be discovered.</p><p>The pathological liars in the group also reported telling lies for no specific reason, and said many of their lies grew out of an initial lie.</p><p>The majority of participants in the pathological liars group indicated that their problematic lying began during adolescence. People in this group were also more likely to say their lying was out of their control, indicating a kind of compulsiveness. Likewise, people in this group said they felt less anxious after lying.</p><h2>From <em>pseudologia phantastica</em> to pathological liars</h2><p>The phenomenon of the “pathological liar” was first recorded in 1891 by psychiatrist <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/pathologische-L%C3%BCge-psychisch-abnormen-Schwindler/dp/3226034618/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594994372&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAnton+Delbr%C3%BCck&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anton Delbr?ck</a>. He initially called it <em>pseudologia phantastica</em>, and used the term to describe people who told so many outrageous lies that their behavior could be considered pathological.</p><p>Since then, research into pathological lying has been surprisingly scant. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05068.x">analysis</a> of prior case studies found <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pathological lying</a> equally represented among men and women, with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://psychnewsdaily.com/category/iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IQs</a> of the liars in the average to above average range.</p><h2>Formal recognition</h2><p>Pathological lying has not (yet) been classified as a diagnostic entity in either the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSM-5</a> or the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICD-10</a>, but the researchers behind the present study are hoping to change that. As they write, “we suggest that PL should be defined as a persistent, pervasive, and often compulsive pattern of excessive lying behavior that leads to clinically significant impairment of functioning in social, occupational, or other areas.”</p><p>Pathological lying also causes distress, they say, and poses a risk to the self or others; an example of this risk is if a pathological liar conceals the presence of suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Formal recognition of pathological lying as a disorder would bring many benefits, as researchers would then be better able to examine its features and causes. And effective treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and possibly pharmaceutical drugs, could then be more thoroughly investigated.</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> P<em>athological Lying: Theoretical and Empirical Support for a Diagnostic Entity</em><br><strong>Authors: </strong><a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#">Drew A.

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkDVKthufAM" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<p>Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so.</p>

<p>Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so.</p>

<p>The draft code will allow Australian news businesses to negotiate for fair payment for their journalists’ work that is included on Google services.</p>

<p>This will address a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook.</p>

<p>A healthy news media sector is essential to a well-functioning democracy.</p>

<p>We will continue to consult on the draft code with interested parties, including Google.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code/draft-legislation">Consultation</a> closes on 28 August 2020.</p>

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>
