                    <p>Early in my career, after a short initial interview at a consulting firm in Toronto, I was invited to a technical interview on the same day. Two of the senior developers from the team I would join would conduct the interview.</p><p>The interview started pleasantly with them describing the project they have been working on: a portal for university professors to communicate with their students. It was being built with ASP.NET MVC, a framework I had been working with for several years. I expressed that I was comfortable with the framework and I would be excited to work on the project. Then the technical examination began and on its conclusion I left the interview feeling humiliated.</p><p>Many years later, when I was preparing to take an interview, I looked back on this experience to realize that the line of questioning and approach had been an ego trip for those developers. I promised myself to <em>never</em> make any of my candidates feel the way I did.</p><p>What did those developers do wrong? Leaving aside their attitude towards me, their questions had no relevance to the role or the project. I did not know what a red-black tree was at the time but I definitely knew how to use ASP.NET MVC which they did not inquire about.</p><p>My golden rule for technical interviews is that, "Every step, conversation and question <em>must</em> be pertinent to the day-to-day of the role." While this may be obvious, I am sure that many hiring managers are still expecting candidates to arrive at technical interviews with Computer Science books memorized. This form of technical interviews should be made obsolete.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bigger button = more clicks on the CTA <a href="https://t.co/Ter7xJdNKM">pic.twitter.com/Ter7xJdNKM</a></p>— Vincent Déniel (@vincentdnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentdnl/status/1291041278264713220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>With my golden rule as guide, I conduct a much simpler interview process. Prior to an interview, my team and I review samples of code that the candidate shared with us (or had written on Github) to understand the quality of their code. And during the interview, I dive into three areas of discussions with the candidates: product building, process adherence and team work.</p><h3 id="product-building">Product Building</h3><p>I try to understand the candidate's interest and experience of building products by,</p><ol><li>Going through their past experience and asking about what technologies and products they built and how.

<p>
08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

        <h2 id="in-which-i-am-stunted-upon-by-coin-flips">In which I am stunted upon by coin flips</h2>
<p>Wasn’t too long ago that I felt pretty good about my knowledge of distributed systems.
All someone <em>really</em> needed in order to understand them, I thought, was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o">thorough understanding of the paxos protocol</a> and a willingless to reshape your brain in the image of TLA+.
Maybe add a dash of conflict-free-replicated datatypes, just so you know what “eventual consistency” means.
Past that it’s just some optimizations and mashups which come easily to your TLA+-addled brain.</p>
<p>This belief proved surprisingly robust over a number of years, even surviving an aborted attempt at analyzing the <a href="https://github.com/ahelwer/tla-experiments/blob/master/Nano.tla">Nano cryptocurrency</a>.
It was only after encountering <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/06/snowflake-to-avalanche-novel-metastable.html">the snowflake family of consensus protocols</a> that I realized my theory just wasn’t up to the challenge.
The issue was <em>probability</em>: snowflake protocols reach consensus by iteratively polling sets of other nodes at random, and the argument that consensus is eventually reached is a statistical argument deriving an upper bound on the probability of failure.</p>
<p>I didn’t <em>dislike</em> probability &amp; statistics, I just tried to keep my distance as much as possible.
All the algorithms in distributed systems I’d encountered so far involved <em>nondeterminism</em>, sure, but not probability.
I’d assumed nondeterminism was just a more flexible way of reasoning about probability.
This idea of mine would prove to be a source of great unnecessary confusion as I learned the art of reasoning about probabilistic distributed systems, so I’ll do you a favor and give you the core lesson of this entire post in one sentence:</p>
<p><strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism, and you cannot model nondeterminism with probability.</strong></p>
<h2 id="models-theyre-good-folks">Models: they’re good, folks!</h2>
<p>Have you ever been writing some multithreaded code, happily plugging in a mutex here, a semaphore there, or even just using some nice message-passing primitives to make your threads all get along?
Maybe you’ll be familiar, then, with what often comes next.
A scratch at the back of your mind, a thought - <em>“oh, wait…"</em> - as you realize something weird will happen if thread \(A\) manages to reach some step before thread \(B\) has finished its assigned task.
No worries! Slap on another WaitHandle, problem solved.
Except the problem wasn’t solved. Not really.
You consider it a bit more - what if thread \(C\) comes in with a message at this inopportune time?
You realize with dawning horror you’re actually tracing cracks in the foundation.
Patch them with mutexes! Semaphores! Anything!
Alas, you are beyond help. It’s around this time that your brain, catching a glimpse of the infinite plane of combinatorial state explosion, wisely ducks its head back down for the day and leaves you with a woozy, fuzzy, clenching feeling for having the gall to ask it to fix all this.</p>
<p>I’ve felt like this many times, and formal models are the only cure I’ve ever found.
Your brain isn’t built to hold massive state spaces in its working memory, so don’t even try.
Let a model checking program churn through all those states to find the bugs.
At this point I won’t even touch a multithreaded program or distributed system without whipping up a quick TLA+ spec of its desired workings.
I just specify all the possible events in the system, how those events affect the system state, what things I always want to remain true (the invariants), then let the model checker rip.
In TLA+, we model concurrency with nondeterminism; in a concurrent system, we have no idea whether thread \(A\) will execute a step before thread \(B\).
We can represent this with a nondeterministic state machine as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/nondeterministic.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>So you’ll be in state \(s_3\) if thread \(A\) executes its step before thread \(B\), and state \(s_4\) if thread \(B\) executes its step before thread \(A\).
Maybe \(s_3\) and \(s_4\) are even the same state, who knows.
The model checker will explore both of these possible execution orders, and <strong>in a well-designed concurrent system we should <em>never</em> end up in a bad state just because of a certain order of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Readers might wonder how exactly this models concurrency, where steps can happen uh, concurrently.
The short answer is you have to ensure all the steps in your model are atomic or independent: either impossible in the real world for two of your steps to happen at the exact same time (for example, by assuming use of a lower-level hardware synchronization primitive) or impossible for execution of one step to directly affect the same variables as another step (for example, if the steps are executed on different computers within a timespan less than the network latency between them).
If the steps in your model satisfy this requirement, checking all possible execution orders accurately models concurrency.
If they don’t, you need to break the steps down further so they do.
This model nicely captures &amp; exposes all that is difficult about concurrency.</p>
<p>What questions can we ask about this sort of model?
The most important questions are <em>reachability queries</em> - can we reach a <em>bad state</em> (two caches disagreeing on a value, deadlock, dogs &amp; cats living together, etc.) from the starting state?
These questions are called <em>safety properties</em>, and if they are answered in the negative then the system is safe.
Another type of query is something like “are we always guaranteed to eventually end up in a good state?”
These are called <em>liveness properties</em>.
Turns out these two types of questions can get you pretty far in concurrent &amp; distributed systems.
Definitely far enough to make a whole career out of writing rock-solid software in places others would falter.
However, these questions also have a drawback: their answers are absolute.
True or false.
No probability involved, no room for nuance.</p>
<p>What if one of the threads flips a coin, and if it’s heads it does one thing, tails another?
Entire state spaces, bifurcated by a probabilistic event.
Maybe those state spaces contain further coin flips, or other types of randomness.
In this system your questions might change from the form “is it possible to reach a bad state” to “what is the probability of reaching a bad state?”
Unfortunately these types of questions just cannot be answered within the nondeterministic model used above.
<strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism.</strong>
We must use a new type of model, a state machine that handles probability directly.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-the-beautiful-pure-discrete-realm">Leaving the beautiful pure discrete realm</h2>
<p>TLA+ can’t handle probability at this time, so we’d have to use a specialized modeling language like <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> which handles probabilistic state machines.
Let’s look at the standard hello-world example for probabilistic state machines: the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=KY76">1976 Knuth-Yao method</a> for simulating a fair six-sided die with a series of coin flips.
This is really quite a neat problem and I encourage you to ponder it for a second before seeing how they did it!
Any sequence of \(n\) coin flips will give you an event which has probability \(\frac{1}{2^n}\) of occurring.
Simulating a fair six-sided die requires generating an event with probability \(\frac{1}{6}\) of occurring.
You might then reason this problem is impossible, because you cannot evenly divide \(2^n\) by \(6\) for any \(n\) (this follows from the uniqueness of prime factorization).
Indeed, there is no way to simulate a six-sided die with a finite number of coin flips.
We have to use an algorithm which is not guaranteed to ever terminate, although vanishingly unlikely not to do so.
Here it is:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/knuth-yao.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that if you somehow only flip heads, or only flip tails, you’ll never reach one of the accepting states (here labeled with the die number they represent).
There are some fun ways to contextualize the probabilities of you only flipping heads or tails a certain number of times in a row.
For example, there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">around \(2^{268}\) subatomic particles in the observable universe</a>; if you manage to flip heads 268 times in a row, that’s the same as picking the correct subatomic particle out of a universe-wide random draw.
Maybe go look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> as you ponder this probability.
Another way is assuming you’re between the ages of 25-34 and live in the USA, your annual all-cause mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">about 129/100,000</a>.
Assuming deaths are uniformly distributed throughout the year, this means your chances of dying today are about 1 in 283,000.
This is just 18 all-heads or all-tails coin flips in a row.
What I’m saying is that you really, really shouldn’t worry about having to flip the coin very many times.</p>
<p>This probabilistic state machine model we’ve created is called a <em>Discrete-Time Markov Chain</em>, or DTMC.
In DTMCs, every transition has an associated probability and the probabilities of all out-flowing transitions must sum to one for every state (accepting states can be thought to have a loopback with probability 1).
The above rumination on termination probabilities is summed up in <em>the long run theorem</em>: in the long run, every path in a finite Markov chain ends in an absorbing state, which is a state (or group of states) from which there is an entrance but no exit.
What questions can we ask of DTMCs?
The most interesting one - the reason why we’re here - is “what is the probability of eventually reaching a certain state?”
The long run theorem tells us we have a 100% chance of eventually reaching <em>one</em> of the Knuth-Yao state machine’s accepting states.
What about the probability of ending up in a specific accepting state?
It should be \(\frac{1}{6}\). Is it?</p>
<p>Let’s try to reason this out with basic probability.
What are the chances of ending up in accepting state \(1\)?
Well, you can get there by flipping \(HHT\).
The probability of that happening is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \).
But you can also get there by flipping \(HHHHT\).
The probability of <em>that</em> happening is \(\frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).
We have to add this to the first probability, so now our probability is \(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{32}\).
But we can <em>also</em> get there …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust doesn’t have namespaces in its package management system. It’s often viewed as a bug. But it’s not a bug, it’s a feature! While there are negative aspects of a flat package registry, there are also real benefits. Stability, continuity, and unity (discourages forks and fragmented identity). Proposals that seek to add namespacing without addressing the positive aspects they remove probably won’t be accepted.</p><p>I have noticed the benefits of the current system seem to only get mentioned in passing as objections to proposals and never outlined anywhere. This is an attempt to fix that by summarizing points raised across the various proposals I’ve read. While I don’t represent the crates.io team (I’m not even on the team) I hope to accurately represent trade-offs being considered.</p><h2 id="aspects-of-registry-structure">Aspects of Registry Structure</h2><p>How identity works in package management has far-reaching consequences. Most of the namespace proposals I’ve seen have been motivated by trying to address squatting and/or tweaking the current system of package identity. However, the structure of the crates.io registry affects more than just those areas. But we’ll start with the basics of identity and work from there.</p><h3 id="identity">Identity</h3><p>How do you refer to a package? A crate has at least three identities I can think of:</p><ul><li>The name on crates.io - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The name used in Cargo.toml - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The default name used in code - there is can be more than one per name, which is rare in practice</li><li>The actual name used in code - this can be controlled through Cargo.toml or externs statements, but renaming isn’t required</li></ul><p>The first two are called the <code>package.name</code> in Cargo.toml of the crate being published. The third can be overridden via <code>lib.name</code> in the package being published. The last is user-controlled. Usually, all of these names match, with the caveat that dashes are underscores in code (and crates.io doesn’t allow two crates with identical crates.io names after normalizing dashes to underscores).</p><p>Arguably, self-explanatory identities have a leg up on other identities from a discoverability perspective. E.g. <code>argparse</code> probably seems more reputable at first glance than <code>clap</code> if you’re going of name alone.</p><p>A flat registry makes identity management (naming a crate) harder. You either have to pick a GUID (haha, please don’t) or some memorable (but probably mostly or completely unrelated) identity. I see this as the main driving force for proposals seeking to add namespaces or otherwise address squatting.</p><h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3><p>Currently, identity is continuous - a crate’s identity is immutable and that has real benefits. If you want to change the identity system at all you’ve got to ensure that identities don’t change out from under you. This is a strike against any namespace system that allows namespace ownership to unexpectedly change. Discontinuous identity has a couple of issues.</p><p>First, if a crate’s name can change, that’s bad for users. They have to go figure out the new name of the package if they want to update.</p><p>Second, if an identity’s crate can change (a consequence of the previous point if identities are reusable), then you’ve introduced a security vulnerability. Updating to a new package version with different content under different ownership is a real security risk. Doubly so if you don’t ban new minor versions on the last major version after an unintentional ownership change. Should people audit their crate? Yes! But the fewer foot-guns we have the better.</p><p>In addition to preventing security issues, proposals need to encourage transitions over transactions. Gradual moves over all-or-nothing moves. This could be seen more as compatibility than continuity. This drives things like the rust editions and the need for namespace proposals to be backward compatible.</p><h3 id="stability">Stability</h3><p>A core tenet of Rust is stability. The obvious definition is that things that compile yesterday should compile today (even with a new compiler).</p><p>A less obvious definition is that adding new dependencies shouldn’t stop you from compiling already working code. This is a major motivation for the orphan rule (though the orphan rule is more nuanced than that). This is a strike against schemes that encourage multiple distinct crates to have the same default name in code. I don’t think any proposal that encourages this could be approved. It also suggests that we ought to ban new instances of a crates default code name deviating from its package/Cargo.toml name.</p><p>In addition to code stability, crates.io should be stable too. It should be able to isolate itself from outside services. It currently depends on Github, but it doesn’t have to. This is a strike against any system that weds namespace identity to any externally managed system.</p><h3 id="squatting">Squatting</h3><p>The current identity system encourages squatting. I would define squatting as reserving a crate without actually using it. This is a natural outcome in the Rust ecosystem for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>Crates are easy to publish, so it’s easy to reserve a crate by publishing an empty crate</li><li>We have de-facto namespaces using prefixes - <code>serde-*</code> is one example.</li><li>There can only ever be one version of a package name. There is only one <code>http</code> crate for example. So package names are a scarce resource.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot of squatting on crates.io. I don’t have any hard numbers though.</p><p>We don’t have any structured support for squatting either, which makes it hard to separate bad actors from good actors. I think separating them out would require manual intervention, and the crates.io team is small and doesn’t have a lot of time to put towards that.</p><p>So what’s a bad actor? I consider someone who squats a bunch of crates to make or point or prevent their names from being used to be a bad actor. Crates.io has a policy against using automation to claim ownership of crates, but I haven’t heard much about it being enforced. Again, time is an issue. And this would probably extend to namespace ownership as well.</p><p>I do think there are legitimate uses. Reserving a set of extension crates for a project you’re working on is one example. My other example is reserving a crate you genuinely intend to work on (this one is a little more debatable).</p><h2 id="it-s-about-the-trade-offs">It’s about the Trade-offs</h2><p>With this system in mind, it’s hard to come up with a namespace proposal that doesn’t hurt the current system in some way.</p><p>I’d say the biggest tension is in code-level identities. They become either overlapping by chopping the namespace portion off or much longer by including the namespace portion. The previous points show why overlapping is generally considered a non-starter. And for longer identities, you need to come up with some new way to reference namespaces in code that’s doesn’t break things.</p><p>More to the point though, from what I’ve seen, most people proposing identity schemes propose it so that the ecosystem can support the overlapping crate identities (e.g. multiple http crates). And that’s exactly what the current system avoids doing.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">an on-point quote from CAD97</a> summing up (hopefully fairly accurately) what namespaces mean to the parties involved:</p><blockquote><p>To the crates team, it seems to <em>primarily</em> mean that a project can put multiple packages together under an umbrella, such that you know the packages are for-sure by the project.</p><p>To the people who feel most slighted by the crates team’s approach here, namespaces <em>primarily</em> mean the ability to publish a crate with a desired name even if there’s already a package published that provides a crate with that name, by putting the package into a different namespace such that the names do not clash.</p><p>If the latter party asks about “namespaces” and means the latter, and the team answers and means the former, you can see where the miscommunication enters, especially since the crates team has now communicated here the position that <em>generally</em>, the <code>package.name == lib.name</code> falsehood should not be made more false; i.e., the latter group’s goal is an explicitly non-desired property from the crates team.</p></blockquote><h2 id="where-to-now">Where to Now?</h2><p>There have been other proposals for namespaces that are less about overlapping identity and more about curation and grouping related crates together. There are multiple proposals there, each with their trade-offs. Expect a follow-up post discussing some of those.</p><h2 id="appendix-a-highlights">Appendix A: Highlights</h2><p>There’s a nice set of a dozen or so comments I save as I reviewed past discussions:</p><p>Carol10Cents (of the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20</a></li></ul><p>kornel:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26</a></li></ul><p>sgrif (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7</a></li></ul><p>CAD97:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633</a></li></ul><p>withoutboats (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10</a></li></ul><p>ag_dubs (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28</a></li></ul><p>pietroalbini (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791</a></li></ul><p>Random meeting notes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT">https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT</a></li></ul><h2 id="appendix-b-previous-discussions">Appendix B: Previous Discussions</h2><p>There have been several attempts at this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320</a> (This was mine from last year after reading through the other proposals; my …</li></ul></div></div>

		<div>
		<p>Checked exceptions have always been a controversial feature of the Java language.</p>
<p>Advocates claim they ensure checking &amp; recovery from failures. Detractors say “catch” blocks can almost never recover from an exception, and are a frequent source of mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Java 8 and lambdas are here. Are checked exceptions becoming obsolete in the Java world?<span id="more-174"></span></p>
<h3>The Intent of Checked Exceptions</h3>
<p>In the mid 90’s, James Gosling at Sun came up with a new language.</p>
<p>At the time, C++ programming required every single function return to be checked for error. He decided there had to be a better way, and built the concept of “exceptions” into Java.</p>
<p>The intent of <strong>checked exceptions</strong> was to locally flag, and force developers to handle, possible exceptions. Checked exceptions have to be declared on a method signature, or handled.</p>
<p>This was intended to encourage software reliability &amp; resilience. There was an intent to “recover” from contingencies – predictable outcomes other than success, such as InsufficientFundsException on attempting a payment. There was less clarity, as to what “recovery” actually entailed.</p>
<p><strong>Runtime exceptions</strong>&nbsp;were also included in Java. Since null pointers, data errors, and illegal states/ accesses could occur anywhere in code, these were made subtypes of RuntimeException.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions can be thrown anywhere, without requiring to be declared, and are much more convenient. But would it be correct to use them instead?</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The crucial point here, is that runtime &amp; checked exceptions are functionally equivalent.&nbsp;There is no handling or recovery which checked exceptions can do, that runtime exceptions can’t.</p>
<p>The biggest argument against “checked” exceptions is that most exceptions can’t be fixed. The simple fact is, <strong>we don’t own the code/ subsystem that broke.&nbsp;</strong>We can’t see the implementation, we’re not responsible for it, and can’t fix it.</p>
<p>Particularly problematic were the areas of JDBC (SQLException) and RMI for EJB (RemoteException). Rather than identifying fixable contingencies as per the original “checked exception” concept, these forced pervasive systemic reliability issues, not actually fixable, to be widely declared.</p>
<p>For any method, the possibility of failure includes all sub-methods called by it. Potential failures accumulate up the call tree. Declaring these on method signatures no longer offers a specific &amp; local highlight for the developer to watch for – declared exceptions spread throughout the call tree.</p>
<p>Most EJB developers have experienced this – declared exceptions become&nbsp;required on methods through the tier,&nbsp;or entire codebase. Calling a method with different&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;requires dozens of methods to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Many developers were told to catch low-level exceptions, and rethrow them again as higher (application-level) checked exceptions. This required vast numbers – 2000 per project, upwards – of non-functional “catch-throw” blocks.</p>
<p>Swallowing exceptions, concealing the cause, double logging, and returning ‘null’/ uninitialized data all became common. Most projects could count 600+ mis-coded or outright errors.</p>
<p>Eventually, developers rebelled against the vast numbers of “catch” blocks, and the source of error these had become.</p>
<h3>Checked Exceptions – incompatible with Functional Coding</h3>
<p>And then we get to Java 8, with its new <i><b>functional programming&nbsp;</b></i>features – such as lambdas, Streams, and function composition.</p>
<p>These features are built on generics – parameter &amp; return types are genericized, so that iteration &amp; stream operations ( <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>) can be written which perform a common operation, regardless of item type.</p>
<p>Unlike data types, however, declared exceptions can’t be genericized.</p>
<p>There is no possibility in Java to provide a stream operation (like, for example, &nbsp;<code>Stream.map</code>) which takes a lambda declaring some checked exception, &amp; transparently passes that same checked exception to surrounding code.</p>
<p>This has always been a major points against checked exceptions – all intervening code, between a throw and the receiving “catch” block, is forced to be aware of exceptions.</p>
<p>The workaround, of “wrapping” it in a RuntimeException, conceals the original type of the exception – rendering the exception-specific “catch” blocks envisaged in the original concept useless.</p>
<p>Finally we can capture Java’s new philosophy in a nutshell, by noting that none of the new “functional interfaces” in Java 8 declare checked exceptions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Exceptions in Java provided major benefits in reliability &amp; error-handling over earlier languages.&nbsp;Java enabled reliable server &amp; business software, in a way C/ C++ never could.</p>
<p>Checked exceptions were,&nbsp;in their original form, an attempt&nbsp;to handle&nbsp;<i>contingencies</i>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<i>failures</i>.&nbsp;The laudable goal was to highlight specific predictable points (unable to connect,&nbsp;file not found,&nbsp;etc) &amp; ensure developers handled these.</p>
<p>What was never included in the original concept, was to force a vast range of systemic &amp;&nbsp;unrecoverable failures to be declared. These <em>failures</em>&nbsp;were never correct to be&nbsp;declared as checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Failures are generally possible in code, and EJB, web &amp; Swing/AWT containers already cater for this by providing an outermost “failed request” exception-handler. The most basic correct strategy is to rollback the transaction &amp; return an error.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions allow any exception-handling possible with checked exceptions, but avoid restrictive coding restraints. This simplifies coding &amp; makes it easier to follow best practice of&nbsp;<a href="http://wikijava.org/wiki/10_best_practices_with_Exceptions#Throw_early_catch_late" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://wikijava.org']);">throw early, catch late</a>&nbsp;where exceptions are handled at the outermost/ highest possible level.</p>
<p>Leading Java frameworks and influences have now definitively moved&nbsp;away from checked exceptions. Spring, Hibernate and modern Java frameworks/&nbsp;vendors&nbsp;use only runtime exceptions, and this convenience is a major factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>Personalities such Josh Bloch (Java&nbsp;Collections framework), Rod Johnson, Anders Hejlsberg (father of&nbsp;C#), Gavin King&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn&nbsp;(JodaTime)&nbsp;have all come out against checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, in&nbsp;Java 8,&nbsp;lambdas are&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundamental step forward.&nbsp;These language features&nbsp;abstract the “flow of control” from functional operations within. As we’ve seen, this makes checked exceptions &amp; the requirement to “declare or handle immediately” obsolete.</p>
<p>For developers, it is always important to pay attention to reliability &amp; diagnose likely points of failure (contingencies) such as file open, database connection, etc. If we provide good error messages at this points, we will have&nbsp;created&nbsp;self-diagnosing software – a pinnacle of engineering achievement.</p>
<p>But we should do this with unchecked exceptions, and if we have to rethrow, should always use RuntimeException or an app-specific subclass.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn says, if your projects&nbsp;are&nbsp;still using or advocating checked exceptions, your skills are 5-10 years out date.&nbsp;Java&nbsp;has moved&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. The doc recommended I up the dosage, but I could see this would eventually lead me to a straitjacket.</p>



<p>Over the years I’ve tried different meds, various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as clinical depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and covid anxiety. My longest bouts of depression now last a day at most and even that doesn’t happen too often.</p>

          <p>I was incredibly lucky to spend 5 amazing years at Heroku. By the end of my time, I was operating in a Staff capacity, although I’m honestly completely unclear which titles at Salesforce actually map to Staff.</p>

<p>Because titles are unclear and because my role was a little amorphous, I chose not to submit a story to Will Lethain’s <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/">great collection</a> at StaffEng.com. That being said, I added a few questions to his questionnaire that I hadn’t seen answered elsewhere, so I figured I’d post this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tell us a little about your current role: where do you work, your title and generally the sort of work do you and your team do.</em></strong></p>

<p>Until recently, I was a Principal engineer at Salesforce, working for their Heroku product. I joined almost five years ago, working on the Heroku Add-ons product, and then transferred to the Heroku API team. For the last year and a half, I worked on the API team for the Salesforce Functions product, which runs on top of Heroku infrastructure.</p>

<p>The API team is at the center of defining how the Salesforce Functions product will work, so there are a lot of different tasks our team does. First and foremost, we write the code to store the state that the customer <em>intends</em> their infrastructure to converge to and then push that down into the infrastructure layer. If you’re interacting with Salesforce Functions, you’re going through our code. We also do a lot of reconciling what the infrastructure can do with the hopes and dreams of product. I did a balance of work, but more towards the “hopes and dreams” side of things.</p>

<p><strong><em>What does a “normal” Staff-plus engineer do at your company? Does your role look that way or does it differ?</em></strong></p>

<p>There is really no “normal” Staff engineer at Salesforce. I usually talk about four different approaches I see in the company, some of which line up with <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes">Will’s archetypes</a> and some which don’t. A lot of folks are a mix of these and rotate through them over a long career at the company.</p>

<p><em>Team(s) Lead/Right Hand</em></p>

<p>You are the primary technical point of contact for 10-20 engineers, across one or more teams. You are typically reporting to a manager of managers. Responsibilities vary based on individuals’ strengths and the strengths of their manager, but there are some common things you <em>must</em> do. If you’re not making your delivery timelines and this is a surprise to your organization, you and your manager have a problem. If product has a dream and no one knows what it would take to build it (time, resources, architecture), you have a problem. If you can’t answer “Why are we building this in this way?” then you have a problem.</p>

<p><em>Product Architect</em></p>

<p>If it’s on TechCrunch or promoted at our corporate conferences, there is an Architect for it. If the project (40+ engineers) fails to be a success, you share responsibility along with the (typically) VP+ engineering manager and Product owner. If you have any type of personal presence, you will be put on a stage and in front of customers. This is the level where you’re helping advocate with your VP for major initiatives to go after certain markets. If we made the wrong bet, some blame is with product, but it’s also on you, and the manager probably won’t look great.</p>

<p><em>Deep Diver</em></p>

<p>You have a lot of deep technical expertise on a particular component or system. You tend to stay on a single team or a single area of the organization. If you work in our legacy codebases, which are the core of our profitability, you are basically unfireable because you know so much. You may write code for some of the gnarliest problems of the legacy system you’re being kept around for, but you’ll often find yourself spending more time interfacing with other teams to explain why your system can’t do what they want and how we can work around it to deliver on a reasonable timeline. You will work closely with your Team Lead on a daily/weekly basis and occasionally have your entire day/week blown up because the Product Architect has identified a need for your expertise and all of a sudden you’re being trotted out to present to some team you’ve never heard of.</p>

<p><em>The Management</em></p>

<p>There are two variants. First, you’re pendulum’ing over to a line manager role, but since your IC title is the same grade as Director or VP, making you a manager would result in a massive pay cut. You’re likely managing a smaller team, given Salesforce targets 12-15 reports. In the second variant, you’re roughly an extension of a VP+ leader. Maybe you’re working on how we keep our many thousands of engineers communicating well. Maybe you’re advising an SVP on where to make technical investments - does our company really have enough of a competitive advantage to go after that market? Sure, the SVP/C-suite person is being told by Product that if you only give us $100 million we can do a ton. Is that true? Hey, we just bought a multi-billion dollar business (or we’re about to): Can you figure out what we should do with them? Many, including Will, call this fire-fighting, but that’s too narrow a view of how these roles really deliver value to large companies: it’s fast-paced opportunity scouting and truth-telling. That being said, you’ll most likely be looking for opportunities and the real truth within the more challenged parts of the business, so I see the fire-fighting analogy.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you define success in your role?</em></strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I am successful if the folks I work with understand how business decisions tie into their day-to-day work.</p>

<p>At a minimum, this involves a fair amount of understanding why we’re being asked to build something, running ahead of the team to make sure product plans are in place for us, working across teams to come up with an achievable plan and then championing IC concerns as they crop up.</p>

<p>But it also means pushing forward discussions about what kinds of risk are worth taking on in our code at the moment. Is now the right time to commit to this abstraction? Is now the time to address a performance issue with a re-architecture? We’re moving quickly, but also seeing a lot of incidents - what kinds of testing should we invest in?</p>

<p>Success looks like seeing conversations about timeline and priorities between ICs start from a shared background. Success looks like having no major blow ups about “How could you suggest we ship this hack?” Instead, folks can talk about technical choices through a business lens: “I know we’re currently low on staff compared to our product ambitions, but is this the right place to simplify?” Success looks like a team with a shared goal for the quality and resiliency of code that we’re writing. Success also looks like other ICs feeling confident in advocating for changes, since they see our team making technical decisions with a consistent goal in mind. When I talk with ICs in 1:1s, there should be no “I’m not sure why I’m doing X” when it comes to code, infrastructure and incidents.</p>

<p>Next, I am successful when my management chain clearly understanding the particular risks we’re taking on. All of the architectural decisions a team makes will be wrong, eventually. Whether technology changes, our customer base changes or the product itself changes, it’s only a matter of time before we regret those big choices. The key is understanding what bets we’re making and how long we think before we’ll need to revisit them.</p>

<p>Architecture in a large enterprise is a lot about risk management. A large org has a lot of existing momentum in the market and naturally becomes more cautious. I only have a few places where I can advocate for higher-risk bets and those bets are going to be far lower risk than at a start up. While I need to embrace the fact that our decisions will be wrong, I need to be able to speak to the ways in which we will likely be wrong, when we’ll know and what our mitigation strategy will be.</p>

<p>Third, I am successful if I’m saying the right “No”s to my manager. If the ICs that report to my manager end up feeling like “I told you so” or “We knew this was a bad idea” and that wasn’t surfaced for a discussion, that’s on me. As a Staff engineer, I have the responsibility to course correct my manager when we’re over-committed or committed to the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Finally, I’m successful if my organization has a healthy engineering culture. No one person owns culture, but that doesn’t mean we all don’t equally share the burden of building a world-class engineering organization.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you spend your time day-to-day?</em></strong></p>

<p>While I do write code from time-to-time, it’s only after I’ve delivered on my obligations on these four functions.</p>

<p><em>Information gathering</em> - In order to help my team understand the context within which we’re building a thing, I need a lot of information. I almost unfailingly start my day with a list of longer emails and docs of all varieties to digest. I also spend a fair amount of time in cross-org chats with assorted managers &amp; ICs, whose purpose is a combination of information gathering and the coaching I mention below.</p>

<p><em>Planning</em> - Knowing a bunch of stuff isn’t helpful unless we actually do something with it, so I also spend a lot of time in planning activities. This is a lot of writing docs and running meetings. Planning activities are usually very collaborative – I rarely know the most on any one thing, but I can knit them all together into a plan.</p>

<p><em>Context sharing</em> - Knowing what we want to do isn’t helpful unless a lot of people understand the plan, so the final category of work that’s execution oriented is sharing all of that context. I attend meetings with other teams to share what we are doing, I review PRs to make sure we’re making small decisions in-line with larger goals, and hold standing team 1:1s to make sure each person feels confident in the direction we’re headed.</p>

<p><em>Coaching &amp; Culture</em> - The final category of work isn’t oriented towards delivering a product, but it’s still critically important to our organization’s long-term health to invest in our engineers. My personal …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<h3><a href="https://xn--rpa.cc/index.html">ʞ</a> / <a href="https://xn--rpa.cc/irl/index.html">essays</a> /</h3>



<p>so here's a short tutorial on ansi escape codes and terminal control, because you philistines won't stop using ncurses and oh my god <em>WHY ARE WE STILL USING NCURSES IT IS THE TWENTY FIRST FUCKING CENTURY</em></p>

<p>the way terminal emulators handle fancy things like color and cursor shape aren't some mysterious opaque black box you can only access through a library. accessing these capabilities is actually extremely simple; they can even be hardcoded into a text file and displayed by <code>cat</code> or <code>less</code>. or even <a href="http://xn--rpa.cc/ansiglot">curl</a>! the way you do this is with something called <em>ANSI escape sequences.</em></p>

<p>almost all UI changes in a terminal are accomplished through in-band signalling. these signals are triggered with the ASCII/UTF-8 character <strong>‹ESC›</strong> (<code>0x1B</code> or <code>27</code>). it's the same <strong>‹ESC›</strong> character that you send to the terminal when you press the <code>Escape</code> key on your keyboard or a key sequence involving the <code>Alt</code> key. (typing <strong>‹A-c›</strong> for instance sends the characters <strong>‹ESC›</strong> and <strong>‹c›</strong> in very rapid succession; this is why you'll notice a delay in some terminal programs after you press the escape key — it's waiting to try and determine whether the user hit <code>Escape</code> or an alt-key chord.)</p>

<p>the simplest thing we can do with these escapes is to make the text <strong>bold</strong> (or "bright"). we accomplish this by sending the terminal the <strong>‹ESC›</strong> character followed by <code>[1m</code>. <code>[</code> is a character indicating to the terminal what kind of escape we're sending, <code>1</code> indicates bold/bright mode, and <code>m</code> is the control character for formatting escapes.</p>

<p>all text sent after this escape sequence will be bold until we explicitly turn it off again (even if your program terminates). there are two ways we can turn off bright mode: by clearing formatting entirely, using the <code>m</code> formatting command with no arguments or the argument <code>0</code>, or more specifically clearing the bold bit with the <code>21m</code> command. (you'll notice that you can usually turn off modes by prefixing the same number with <code>2</code>.)</p>

<p>in a C program, this might look like the following:</p>

<code><b>#include</b> <cite>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</cite>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)
<strong>int</strong> main() {
	write(1, szstr(<em>"plain text - \x1b[1mbold text\x1b[0m - plain text"</em>));
}
</code>

<p>the <code>\x1b</code> escape here is a C string escape that inserts hex character <code>0x1B</code> (<strong>‹ESC›</strong>) into the string. it's kind of ugly and unreadable if you're not used to reading source with explicit escapes in it. you can make it a lot less horrible with a handful of defines, tho:</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)

<span>#define</span>     plain "0" /* or "" */
<span>#define</span>        no "2"
<span>#define</span>    bright "1"
<span>#define</span>       dim "2"
<span>#define</span>    italic "3"
<span>#define</span> underline "4"
<span>#define</span>   reverse "7"
<span>#define</span>      with ";"
<span>#define</span>  ansi_esc "\x1b"
<span>#define</span> fmt(style) ansi_esc "[" style "m"

<span>int</span> main() {
	write(1, szstr(    <em>"plain text - "</em>
		fmt(bright)     <em>"bright text"</em>     fmt(no bright) <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(dim)       <em>"dim text"</em>        fmt(no dim)    <em>" - "</em> 
		fmt(italic)    <em>"italic text"</em>     fmt(no italic) <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(reverse)   <em>"reverse video"</em>   fmt(plain)     <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(underline) <em>"underlined text"</em> fmt(no underline) )
	);
}
</code>

<p>the beauty of this approach is that all the proper sequences are generated at <em>compile time</em>, meaning the compiler turns all that into a single string interpolated with the raw escapes. it offers much more readability for the coder at zero cost to the end user.</p>

<p>but hang on, where's that semicolon coming from? it turns out, ansi escape codes let you specify multiple formats per sequence. you can separate each command with a <code>;</code>. this would allow us to write formatting commands like <code>fmt(underline with bright with no italic)</code>, which translates into <code>\x1b[4;1;23m</code> at compile time.</p>

<p>of course, being able to style text isn't nearly good enough. we also need to be able to color it. there are two components to a color command: what we're trying to change the color of, and what color we want to change it to. both the foreground and background can be given colors separately - despite what ncurses wants you to believe, you do not have to define """color pairs""" with each foreground-background pair you're going to use. this is a ridiculous archaism that nobody in the 21st fucking century should be limited by.</p>

<p>to target the foreground, we send the character <code>3</code> for normal colors or <code>9</code> for bright colors; to target the background, we send <code>4</code> for normal or <code>10</code> for bright. this is then followed by a color code selecting one of the traditional 8 terminal colors.</p>

<p>note that the "bright" here is both the same thing and something different from the "bright" mode we mentioned earlier. while turning on the "bright" mode will automatically shift text it applies to the bright variant of its color <em>if</em> it is set to one of the traditional 8 colors, setting a "bright color" with <code>9</code> or <code>10</code> will not automatically make the text bold.</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)

<span>#define</span> fg "3"
<span>#define</span> br_fg "9"
<span>#define</span> bg "4"
<span>#define</span> br_bg "10"
<span>#define</span> with ";"
<span>#define</span>      plain ""
<span>#define</span>      black "0"
<span>#define</span>        red "1"
<span>#define</span>      green "2"
<span>#define</span>     yellow "3"
<span>#define</span>       blue "4"
<span>#define</span>    magenta "5"
<span>#define</span>       cyan "6"
<span>#define</span>      white "7"
<span>#define</span>   ansi_esc "\x1b"
<span>#define</span> fmt(style) ansi_esc "[" style "m"

<span>int</span> main() {
	write(1, szstr(
		<em>"plain text - "</em>
		fmt(fg blue) <em>"blue text"</em> fmt(plain)               <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(br_fg blue) <em>"bright blue text"</em> fmt(plain)     <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(br_bg red) <em>"bright red background"</em> fmt(plain) <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(fg red with br_bg magenta) <em>"hideous red text"</em> fmt(plain))
	);
}
</code>

<p>when we invoke <code>fmt(fg red with br_bg magenta)</code>, this is translated by the compiler into the command string <code>\x1b[31;105m</code>. note that we're using <code>fmt(plain)</code> (<code>\x1b[m</code>) to clear the coloring here; this is because if you try to reset colors with, for instance, <code>fmt(fg black with bg white)</code>, you'll be overriding the preferences of users who have their terminal color schemes set to anything but that exact pair. additionally, if the user happens to have a terminal with a transparent background, a set background color will create ugly colored blocks around text instead of letting whatever's behind the window display correctly.</p>

<p>now, while it is more polite to use the "8+8" colors because they're a color palette the end-user can easily configure (she might prefer more pastel colors than the default harsh pure-color versions, or change the saturation and lightness to better fit with her terminal background), if you're doing anything remotely interesting UI-wise you're going to run up against that limit very quickly. while you can get a bit more mileage by mixing colors with styling commands, if you want to give <em>any</em> configurability to the user in terms of color schemes (as you rightly should), you'll want access to a much broader palette of colors.</p>

<p>to pick from a 256-color palette, we use a slightly different sort of escape: <code>\x1b[38;5;<em>(color)</em>m</code> to set the foreground and <code>\x1b[48;5;<em>(color)</em>m</code> to set the background, where <em>(color)</em> is the palette index we want to address. these escapes are even more unwieldy than the 8+8 color selectors, so it's even more important to have good abstraction.</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)

<span>#define</span>       with ";"
<span>#define</span>      plain ";"
<span>#define</span> wfg(color) "38;5;" #color
<span>#define</span> wbg(color) "48;5;" #color
<span>#define</span>   ansi_esc "\x1b"
<span>#define</span> fmt(style) ansi_esc "[" style "m"

<span>int</span> main() {
	write(1, szstr(<em>"plain text - "</em>
		fmt(wfg(198) with wbg(232))
			<em>"rose text on dark grey"</em>
		fmt(plain) <em>" - "</em>
		
		fmt(wfg(232) with wbg(248))
			<em>"dark grey on light grey"</em>
		fmt(plain) <em>" - "</em>
		
		fmt(wfg(248) with wbg(232))
			<em>"light grey on dark grey"</em>
		fmt(plain))
	);
}
</code>
<p>here, the stanza <code>fmt(wfg(248) with wbg(232))</code> translates into <code>\x1b[38;5;248;48;5;232m</code>. we're hard-coding the numbers here for simplicity but as a rule of thumb, any time you're using 8-bit colors in a terminal, you should <em>always</em> make them configurable by the user.</p>

<p>the opaque-seeming indexes are actually very systematic, and you can calculate which index to use for a particular color with the formula <code>16 + 36 * r + 6 * g + b</code>, where <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> are integers ranging between 0 and 5. indices 232 through 255 are a grayscale ramp from dark (232) to light (255).</p>

<p>of course, this is still pretty restrictive. 8-bit color may have been enough for '90s CD-ROM games on Windows, but it's long past it's expiration date. using true color is much more flexible. we can do this through the escape sequence <code>\x1b[38;2;<em>(r)</em>;<em>(g)</em>;<em>(b)</em>m</code> where each component is an integer between 0 and 255.</p>

<p>sadly, true color isn't supported on many terminals, urxvt tragically included. for this reason, your program should never rely on it, and abstract these settings away to be configured by the user. defaulting to 8-bit color is a good choice, as every reasonable modern terminal has supported it for a long time now.</p>

<p>but, for users of XTerm, kitty, Konsole, and libVTE-based terminal emulators (such as gnome-terminal, mate-terminal, and termite), it's polite to have a 24-bit color mode in place. for example:</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</em>

<span>#include</span> <em>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</em>

            <h3>Powerful Strings</h3>
            <p>
              There are four ways to express strings: basic, multi-line basic, literal, and
              multi-line literal. <span>Basic strings</span> are surrounded by
              quotation marks:
            </p>
          </div>

          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>str1 = "I'm a string."
str2 = "You can \"quote\" me."
str3 = "Name\tJos\u00E9\nLoc\tSF."</code></pre>

          <p>
            <span>Multi-line basic strings</span> Multi-line basic strings are
            surrounded by three quotation marks on each side and allow newlines. Include a line
            ending backslash to automatically trim whitespace preceeding any non-whitespace
            characters:
          </p>

          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>str1 = """
Roses are red
Violets are blue"""

str2 = """\
  The quick brown \
  fox jumps over \
  the lazy dog.\
  """</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code> str2</code> becomes
            <code>"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."</code>
            (a single sentence with no line breaks).
          </p>

          <p>
            <span> Literal strings</span> are surrounded by single quotes. No
            escaping is performed so what you see is what you get:
          </p>

          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>path = 'C:\Users\nodejs\templates'
path2 = '\\User\admin$\system32'
quoted = 'Tom "Dubs" Preston-Werner'
regex = '&lt;\i\c*\s*&gt;'</code></pre>

          <p>
            Since there is no escaping, there is no way to write a single quote inside a literal
            string enclosed by single quotes. That's where
            <span>multi-line literal strings</span> come in:
          </p>
          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>re = '''\d{2} apps is t[wo]o many'''
lines = '''
The first newline is
trimmed in raw strings.
All other whitespace
is preserved.

<p><strong>Work in progress</strong>: I still need to clean this up &amp; add the complete source code. ETA for a more or less done version is Soon(TM).<br>
<strong>Last updated</strong>: 2020/09/10 because how the eff did this end up on the front page of Hacker News? :D<br>
<strong>Suggestions welcome</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/AnotherKamila/kamila.is/issues/new?labels=teaching&amp;title=[teaching/how-routers-work]+Title">complain</a> if something is unclear or wrong!</p>

<p>This is the inside view of how exactly a router operates. You only need to know this if you are poking inside a router implementation. If that is the case, my condolences.</p>

<p>At the end of this exposition, I will give you the complete source code to a functional router (written in <a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a>, the new &amp; shiny software-defined networking thing). My aim is that you will understand every line of that.</p>

<p>I accompany my explanations below with some P4 code. I think it is useful to read it even if you’ve never seen P4, because it shows a bit more detail than the text and I believe that it is sufficiently pseudocode-ish. Here is a summary of what you need to know to read it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>everything happens per packet</li>
  <li><code>hdr</code> are the packet’s parsed headers</li>
  <li><code>standard_metadata</code> is how you tell the switch to do things with the packet (like send it on a specific port)</li>
  <li><code>meta</code> are user-defined in-memory variables which can be used e.g. for matching in tables</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Figuring out what should be done with packets is done by <em>the control plane/in the slow path/on the CPU/by the controller</em> or similar phrases. I will refer to all of this as “the control plane”.</li>
  <li>Actually forwarding the packets  is done by <em>the data plane/in the fast path/in the hardware/in the switch</em> and such. I will refer to this as “the data plane”.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24436585">Cyph0n on HN did a good job explaining this distinction.</a></p>



<p>A <em>switch</em> (or an L2 switch :-) ) is an L2-only<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> thing. It knows about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses and ports<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. It does <strong>not</strong> know about anything like IP addresses. It has a <strong>MAC table</strong>: it maps MAC addresses to ports.</p>

<p>A <em>router</em> (or an L3 switch by some people’s vocabulary) operates on L3 only. It knows about L3 stuff such as IP addresses and interfaces and hosts. It does <strong>not</strong> know about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses or ports.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> In fact, the routing parts of the router would not have to be changed at all if you decided to use something other than ethernet on L2. It has a <strong>routing table</strong> (details later): a table of subnets/prefixes and how to reach them.</p>

<p>What you normally call a router (that box sitting over there) is actually a router (for handling L3) and one or more switches (for handling L2), and some glue in between. They may in fact be separate chips in hardware.</p>

<p>You need glue to put together the L2 and the L3. This “L2.5” glue is ARP (or NDP for IPv6). It usually lives in the router, but it is glue, not routing, and you can think about it separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-plane-life-of-a-packet">The Data Plane: Life of a Packet</h2>

<p>When a packet arrives and needs to be sent further, these things have to happen to it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It needs to be <em>routed</em>: the <strong>router</strong>, based on L3 information, decides where it needs to go, in L3 speak – it will decide which <em>host</em> to send it to, but not how. This corresponds to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing table</a></em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be passed down to L2: this is where the L2.5 ARP/NDP <strong>glue</strong> translates the L3-speak IP address to L2-speak MAC address. This is the <em>ARP table</em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be <em>forwarded</em> on the correct port: the <strong>switch</strong> puts the packet on the correct port. This is the <em>MAC table</em>.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="life-of-a-packet-now-properly">Life of a Packet, Now Properly</h2>

<h3 id="1-it-needs-to-be-routed-l3router">1. “It needs to be routed”: L3/router</h3>

<p>The packet has a destination IP address. This is matched in the <em>routing table</em>, using a longest-prefix match (LPM), i.e. it matches IP address prefixes. It may either be for a host the router is directly connected to (on some interface), or it may need to be sent further, through a <em>gateway</em> (through some interface). Therefore: <strong>The routing table maps a <em>prefix</em> to either <em>a next hop through a gateway and an interface</em>, or <em>a direct connection through an interface</em></strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>routing_table : Prefix -&gt; NextHop (GatewayIP, Interface) | Direct Interface
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the next hop’s IP address is in the router’s memory only: it does not appear in the packet at any time.</p>

<p>The P4 code defining the IPv4 routing table is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>action ipv4_through_gateway(ipv4_addr_t gateway, interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = gateway;  // send through the gateway
}

action ipv4_direct(interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = hdr.ipv4.dst_addr;  // send directly to the destination
}

table ipv4_routing {
    key = {
        hdr.ipv4.dst_addr: lpm;  // match prefixes
    }
    actions = {
        ipv4_through_gateway;    // ipv4_through_gateway(gateway, iface)
        ipv4_direct;             // ipv4_direct(iface)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();     // If there is no route, drop it -- in reality, we might want to
                                 // send an ICMP "No route to host" packet.
                                 // Note that this is the default route, so control plane might
                                 // want to set a default gateway here instead of dropping.
    size = ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(and the exact same thing for IPv6)</p>

<h3 id="2-it-needs-to-be-passed-down-l25arp-glue">2. “It needs to be passed down”: L2.5/ARP glue</h3>

<p>If we did not drop the packet because there was no route, we now know the IP address and interface of the next hop. (Note that this is a host that is connected to us directly – it is sitting on the same wire.)
We need to translate this into an L2 MAC address in order to pass it to the switch. We do it via the ARP table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arp_table : (IPv4Address, Interface) -&gt; MACAddress
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: <code>Interface</code> conceptually belongs there, but <code>IPv4Address</code> should be unique. We need to store the interface in the control plane anyway, because we want to pre-emptively re-send ARP requests when an entry is about to expire, but in the data plane it is not strictly necessary.</p>

<p>An interesting question arises here: What do we do if there is no match, i.e. when we don’t know the MAC address for the IP? First, we send an ARP request. Then, most routers drop the packet (relying on either retransmissions or “nobody will miss it”). Storing the packet until the ARP reply comes back (or until it expires) would also work, but usually isn’t done.
Sending ARP requests is normally done in the control plane, because the ARP requests need to be throttled and expired and such.</p>

<p>P4 code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>action set_dst_mac(mac_addr_t dst_addr) {
    hdr.ethernet.dst_addr = dst_addr;
}

table ipv4_arp {
    key = {
        meta.ipv4_next_hop: exact;     // next_hop is the host we found in the routing step; we want to send to that
        // meta.out_interface: exact;  // conceptually this belongs here, but actually next_hop should be unique, so
                                       // we can leave it out
    }
    actions = {
        set_dst_mac;                // set_dst_mac(mac)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IPv6 uses NDP instead of ARP, which is different but the same ;-)</p>

<h3 id="3-it-needs-to-be-forwarded-l2switch">3. “It needs to be forwarded”: L2/switch</h3>

<p>This is L2 / the switch. It works on each interface separately (it could be multiple chips in hardware). It gets a packet with some destination MAC address, and it decides on which port it should put it. It uses a <em>MAC table</em> to do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mac_table : MACAddress -&gt; Port
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>P4 code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// note: we're operating on metadata.out_interface

action set_out_port(port_t ports) {
    standard_metadata.egress_spec = ports;
}

action broadcast() {
    // Implementation depends on the switch.
    // In v1model, use a multicast group corresponding to all ports on metadata.out_interface.
}

// we call it dmac -- see below why
table dmac {
    key = {
        hdr.ethernet.dst_addr: exact;
    }
    actions = {
        set_out_port;  // set_out_port(port)
        broadcast;     // no params, uses metadata.out_interface
                       // remember to set broadcast for 0xffffffffffff in the control plane
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;  // we can have at most as many ports as MAC addresses
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: Real switches are a bit more complicated than that: for example, redundant links mean that a MAC address may be on more than one port. However, you will notice when you need to think about this. Normally considering the simple version is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="the-logic-applying-the-tables">The logic: Applying the tables</h3>

<ol>
  <li>apply routing =&gt; find the next hop (either gateway or direct)</li>
  <li>apply ARP translation to the “next hop” host</li>
  <li>send out on the right port</li>
</ol>

<p>In P4:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apply {
    routing.apply();  // fills out metadata.next_hop
    arp.apply();      // sets pkt.ethernet.dst_addr to the MAC of next_hop
    dmac.apply();     // sends out on the port for pkt.ethernet.dst_addr
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note: While this is conceptually correct, we actually also want to apply the auxiliary table mentioned below. The full code contains that.)</p>

<h2 id="the-control-plane-how-to-fill-the-tables">The Control Plane: How to Fill the Tables</h2>

<p>Starting at the bottom for a change:</p>

<h3 id="l3--routing-table">L3 / routing table</h3>

<p>Filled out by the control plane, depending on the context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your home router, it probably has only two entries: the local network (something like 192.168.0.0/24) =&gt; direct on the internal interface, and a default route via your ISP’s gateway on the external interface.
 In this case, the routing table is static and is filled out by the firmware according to the settings.</li>
  <li>In a small company router, there might be a direct network such as 10.0.0.0/24, a remote office in 10.0.1.0/24 via a VPN server, and a default route from the ISP.
 The default route and the direct route would also be filled …</li></ul></div></div>

September 10, 2020 | https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I originally wrote an earlier version of this post at the end of March, when I was working on adding uprobes support to <a href="https://github.com/redsift/redbpf">redbpf</a>. I wanted to blog about the work I was doing and needed an application to instrument for the purpose of this post. At that time Zoom's popularity was rising quickly, and I happened to read somewhere that it supported this creepy attention tracking feature that allowed meeting hosts to monitor if attendees were paying attention. I figured I could try to use uprobes to snoop into the data Zoom was sending to their servers and see how the tracking worked.</p><p>But then Zoom quickly started getting under a lot of fire. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing">Zoombombing</a> became a thing, several security issues were discovered and pretty much everyone started piling on the company. Considering all that, I was advised and ultimately decided not to publish the post.</p><p>Now things seem to have settled, Zoom <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-to-our-users/">improved their security</a> and by popular demand <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000538083-Attendee-attention-tracking">got rid of attention tracking</a>. So I think I can finally publish this! I edited out the part about attention tracking (which no longer exists) and a couple of other things that could potentially get me in trouble.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I wrote a command line tool that uses BPF uprobes to intercept the TLS encrypted data that zoom sends over the network, and here I'm going to show the process I went through to write it. After I wrote this post I made the tool generic so that it can now instrument any program that uses OpenSSL. I published the code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy</a>.</p><h2>Instrumenting applications with uprobes</h2><p>Uprobes let you instrument user space applications by attaching custom code to arbitrary locations inside a target process. It's a bit like running an application in a debugger, setting breakpoints and fiddling around, but programmatically and without the overhead of a debugger.</p><p>An uprobe must be <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/cargo_bpf/#building">compiled</a> and <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/load/struct.Loader.html">loaded</a> like any other BPF program, then it can be attached with the following API:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>attach_uprobe</span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    fn_name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    offset</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>u64</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    target</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    pid</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>pid_t</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p><a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/struct.UProbe.html#method.attach_uprobe">attach_uprobe()</a> parses the <code>target</code> ELF binary or shared library, looks up the function <code>fn_name</code>, and once the target is running it injects the probe code at the resolved address. If <code>offset</code> is non-zero, its value is added to the address of <code>fn_name</code>. If <code>fn_name</code> is <code>None</code>, then <code>offset</code> is interpreted as starting from the beginning of the target's <code>.text</code> section. Finally if a <code>pid</code> is given, the probe will only be attached to the process with the given id.</p><p>In the rest of the post I'm going to show some examples of uprobes, focusing on the code that gets compiled to BPF bytecode, loaded in the kernel and then injected in the target process (in our case zoom). I'm not going to show much of the user-space code that loads the probes. That part is pretty standard rust code that does some setup, then prints out the data coming from the probes as it receives it. If you're interested you can still find all the user-space code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs</a>.</p><h2>Poking into Zoom</h2><p>We're going to use uprobes to inspect the network traffic between the zoom client and the company's servers. Zoom uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> to encrypt the data. In order to intercept the <em>unencrypted</em> data, we need to find out which TLS library is used by the client, then attach uprobes to strategic places inside it.</p><p>Let's start with searching for common TLS symbols using <code>objdump</code>:</p><pre><code><span>$ objdump -CT /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -iE "ssl|gnutls"
</span>000000000080d5b0 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_blockUnknownSSLCertChanged()
<!-- -->000000000080d590 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_sslCertWarningChanged()
</code></pre><p>Those look like callbacks that get invoked when a certificate is invalid, and Zoom does indeed show a warning if you try to intercept its traffic with a tool like <code>mitmproxy</code>. The callbacks deal with certificates, not unencrypted buffers, so they are not useful to us.</p><p>Looking at the output of <code>ldd</code> we can see that Zoom links to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a>, which includes some potentially relevant APIs:</p><pre><code><span>$ objdump -CT /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -iE "QNetworkReq"
</span>0000000000000000      DF *UND*	0000000000000000  Qt_5        QNetworkRequest::QNetworkRequest(QUrl const&amp;)
<!-- -->0000000000000000      DF *UND*	0000000000000000  Qt_5        QNetworkRequest::~QNetworkRequest()
<!-- -->0000000000000000      DF *UND*	0000000000000000  Qt_5        QNetworkAccessManager::get(QNetworkRequest const&amp;)
</code></pre><p><code>QNetworkRequest(QUrl const&amp;)</code> looks like something that could be used to communicate with the backend and does <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qnetworkrequest.html#setSslConfiguration">support TLS</a>. I tried attaching to it and other functions exported by the framework but none of them turned out to be invoked. Zoom supports a number of platforms and devices, it's possible that they use Qt just for the UI on linux, and then have some lower level networking code that can be shared with their other clients.</p><p>At this point it is pretty likely that zoom is linking statically to the TLS library. Let's see if in the <code>.rodata</code> section of the binary there's anything that could point us in the right direction:</p><pre><code><span>$ readelf -p .rodata /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -i ssl | wc -l
</span>739
<!-- -->$ # 😏
<!-- -->$ readelf -p .rodata /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -i 'openssl 1'
<!-- -->  [4a1b66]  OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020
<!-- -->  [58cd50]  OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020
</code></pre><p>Aha! The client is using OpenSSL version 1.1.1g (knowing this will turn out to be very useful), and the library is statically linked.</p><h2>Instrumenting OpenSSL</h2><p>OpenSSL exports two functions named <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_read.html">SSL_read</a> and <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_write.html">SSL_write</a>, which have the following signature:</p><pre><code><span>int</span><span> </span><span>SSL_read</span><span>(</span><span>SSL </span><span>*</span><span>ssl</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> num</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>

Once they are triggered, they get passed a <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/kprobe/struct.Registers.html">Registers</a> argument through which they can access memory.</p><p>The <code>SSL_write_entry</code> probe is the simplest. It reads the registers containing the values of the <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_write</code>, and sends a copy of the buffer to user-space before it gets encrypted.</p><p>The <code>SSL_read_entry</code> probe is similar in that it reads the content of the <code>ssl</code>, <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_read</code>. It doesn't send the buffer to user-space though. Remember the data is decrypted <em>after</em> <code>SSL_read</code> returns, so we need a second uprobe that we attach to the <em>return address</em> of the function. That's what <code>SSL_read_ret</code> is for. It's similar to the other two probes, but is annotated with <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/uprobe/prelude/attr.uretprobe.html">#[uretprobe]</a>, which means that it will trigger once the function it's attached to <em>returns</em>.</p><p>But why do we need two probes for <code>SSL_read</code>, why not just have <code>SSL_read_ret</code>? The answer is that when <code>SSL_read</code> returns, it's likely that the registers that used to contain the function arguments were modified, so we need to read their values at the start of the function and store them so we can retrieve them later. This is a very common pattern when writing BPF code.</p><p>Finally if zoom linked to OpenSSL dynamically or if debugging symbols were present, the user-space code to attach the probes would be as simple as:</p><pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>redbpf</span><span>::</span><span>load</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>;</span><span>

September 10, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/email-registration-is-dead | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/email-registration-is-dead">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/coverimage.png"></center><p>
In our last business, where we ran popular educational products like EasyBib, we learned the power of email registration. When users registered we found that they would come back and use our service more, and eventually subscribe. </p>
<h2 id="firststeptoimproveretentionaddregistration">First step to improve retention: Add registration</h2>
<p>When building our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">solitaire site</a> then, a fun side hobby of ours, adding in email registration and account creation was immediately on our roadmap. When we added the ability to create accounts and track past scores, we immediately saw that our sessions per user increased by 5%. It was a solid win!</p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/fivelift.png"></center>
<p>To encourage more registrations we introduced a leaderboard to see how you performed against other players. You could see how your time and number of moves compared to others who played the same game, and we encouraged sign ups to get your name on the leaderboard. This improved registrations by 22%, and we saw sessions per user increase another 3%. </p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/threelift.png"></center>
<p>All these features encouraged users to play more, compete against themselves and others, and return to the site.</p>
<h2 id="dosendingemailsmoveourkpis">Do sending emails move our KPIs?</h2>
<p>By now, we had learned that registration was a powerful feature in our game to drive loyalty and retention. Given that we were collecting emails as part of our standard registration process, we naturally thought emailing our user base, which had reached over 15,000 users, could naturally drive more return usage. </p>
<p>We started emailing our users to play a new game of the day feature we introduced. Open rates were a solid 17% on average, but click through rates to the game were 1%. This meant it drove about 26 more users to our site (15,000 * 17% * 1%). Moreover, these could have been users who would have gone back to Solitaired whether they read our email or not. </p>
<p>We saw a 0.5% improvement in returning users, but when we stopped sending emails, this didnâ€™t change suggesting the modest improvement was just noise.</p>
<h2 id="removingemailregistration">Removing email registration</h2>
<p>While registration, saving accounts, and leaderboards improved retention, sending emails clearly did not. </p>
<p>I was watching my sister play, who had become a solitaire addict after she QAing the game. She was obsessed with beating her personal bests and getting high scores for the game of the day. When I watched her play though, quizzically, she had not registered for an account. </p>
<p>I asked her why, she said she just didnâ€™t want to give her email away and get bombarded by more emails. I was dumbfounded, because after all, her brother (me), was the co-founder of the site and yet she still had these concerns.</p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/sister.png"></center>
<p>The lightbulb went off. Since sending emails did not provide value, and if anything was an additional cost,  what if we just asked for a username. While this creates issues with password recovery, we thought this would drive up registrations and improve retention. We also have a long term cookie so users wouldnâ€™t have to login again. </p>
<p>When we changed email sign ups simply to usernames, we saw registrations increase by a huge 36%! More importantly, we saw return users increase another 4.5%.</p>
<p>This meant email registration was holding us back from driving retention. </p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/fourfivelift.png"></center>
<p>Digging in further, we're also seeing return visitors playing more games like <a href="https://solitaired.com/freecell">Freecell</a> and <a href="https://solitaired.com/spider">Spider</a>. Leaderboards and simple registration have encouraged users to try new games.</p>
<h2 id="weassumeemailisvaluable">We assume email is valuable</h2>
<p>Depending on your site and space, email surely can be valuable. For ecommerce sites, you can send targeted emails with special offers, for example. </p>
<p>Most of us assume email is beneficial to our businesses, and we rarely test to see if thatâ€™s the case. We have it because it gives us an owned channel to reach out and engage our users whenever we want. </p>
<p>However, we're forgetting a key fact: most of us also hate emails from commercial sites. They clog our inbox, and we instinctually either ignore or delete them. Every once in a while we might open one of those emails up, and even more rarely, we might click the call to action in the email. </p>
<p>Ask if requiring email addresses really moves important business metrics for your site. Sometimes they do. In our case, it just created a poor user experience which weâ€™re now happy to be rid of.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
This is the blog version of a talk I gave on the 2017-12-13 at the Athens
Clojure Meetup, which was kindly hosted by <a href="https://engineering.skroutz.gr/">Skroutz</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1qpIaB6_vM">The video of the talk</a> is
available (the talk was given in Greek, but there are English subtitles). This
blog entry is not an exact transcript of the talk, I've added links and more
information where appropriate (plus the "bonus" sections that were not in the
talk). Since the talk was given a while ago, some information will be outdated.
</p>

<p>
There are essentially two parts to this article: the "what it is" part which
introduces the basic concepts and mechanisms of spec, and also provides some
information so that non-Clojurians can see how spec fits into the larger picture
and the "what you can do with it" part which explores some more interesting use
cases that go beyond basic usage.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge99096d">
<h2 id="orge99096d">What is it?</h2>
<div id="text-orge99096d">
<p>
Clojure is a dynamic language that doesn't enforce the types of parameters or
the return values of functions. This has been a characteristic of the language
that has drawn criticism both internally and from other language communities and
has possibly been a factor impeding adoption in the past.
</p>

<p>
Spec in a way is the response to that, but it's a response that maybe the
community didn't expect because it does not take the traditional approach of
checking types statically. At a very fundamental level spec is a declarative
language that describes data, their type, their shape. Spec follows the general
philosophy of Clojure in that all of its functionality is available at runtime,
you can use it, introspect it, generate it – there is no extra step before
execution when the compiler checks your whole codebase for errors.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org56f06dc">
<h3 id="org56f06dc">What does it look like?</h3>
<div id="text-org56f06dc">
<p>
Spec is still alpha, so the namespace in the <code>require</code> contains <code>.alpha</code> to indicate
that. The following spec defines a <code>username</code> "entity" and says that it has to be
a string:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require '[clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s])

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>string?</code> is a simple function that exists in Clojure core, it's a
predicate function that you pass a string to and it returns <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>, depending on whether the passed value is a string or not.
</p>

<p>
Once you've defined a spec the simplest usage of it is to ask whether
something is valid, by calling <code>valid?</code>, and passing the name of the
spec and then a value:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid? <span>::username</span> <span>"foo"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>true
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfa7c72e">
<h3 id="orgfa7c72e">It's just predicates!</h3>
<div id="text-orgfa7c72e">
<p>
Many cases are covered by built-in predicates, but that doesn't mean
we can't use our own. If we need a spec that checks that a number is
above 5, we can simply write an anonymous function like this one,
and then use it normally as it if was a spec itself:
</p>



<pre>true
</pre>


<p>
And it works as expected with different inputs:
</p>



<pre>false
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6c5c14c">
<h3 id="org6c5c14c">Validate data</h3>
<div id="text-org6c5c14c">
<p>
So, we write a spec and it can validate our data. Let's draw this as a
diagram: the thing on the left that looks like a blueprint is a spec and the
curly braces on the right represents Clojure data (because very often data in
Clojure are maps and maps are written with curly braces). Read the weird arrow
in the middle as "validates":
</p>


<p><img src="https://www.pixelated-noise.com/blog/2020/09/10/what-spec-is/validate-data.png" alt="validate-data.png">
</p>

<p>
It's not much of a diagram, but I'm trying to establish the visual language
for the rest of this article.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgea7799a">
<h3 id="orgea7799a">Collections specs</h3>
<div id="text-orgea7799a">
<p>
Specs can also be applied to collections by composing and nesting
more basic specs together. Here we define an entity called <code>usernames</code>
made up of a collection of <code>username</code>:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require '[clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s])

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::usernames</span> (<span>s</span>/coll-of <span>::username</span>))

(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid? <span>::usernames</span> [<span>"foo"</span> <span>"bar"</span> <span>"baz"</span>]))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>true
</pre>


<p>
You would normally not define this as a separate entity for something that
simple, as <code>s/coll-of</code> can be used ad-hoc in your program.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org81b3460">
<h3 id="org81b3460">Maps</h3>
<div id="text-org81b3460">
<p>
Maps are a bit more interesting. Other technologies such as <a href="https://github.com/plumatic/schema">plumatic
schema</a> (which at some point was the de facto way to validate data in
Clojure), ask you to define both the keys that have to be present in
a map and the data types of the values that correspond to the
keys. The resulting definition looks a bit like a rigidly-defined
class that you usually see in object-oriented languages. Spec very
deliberately moves away from this mentality: the maps are <b>not</b> like
objects, they are <b>not</b> fixed and do not necessarily exist in that one
shape. Instead, maps simply happen to be aggregations of some named
values.
</p>

<p>
This design decision is embodied in two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A map spec written using <code>s/keys</code> which does not define the types of
the values of the map, we only define which existing entities make
up the map.</li>

<li>The name of the key inside the map has to be the same as the name
of the spec already defined elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this case we have defined some single-value specs like username,
password, last-login and comment, and they are aggregated together
in a map defined by the <code>::user</code> spec.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>ns</span> <span>my-project.users</span>
  (<span>:require</span> [clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s]))

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::password</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::last-login</span> number?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::comment</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::user</span>
  (<span>s</span>/keys
   <span>:req</span> [<span>::username</span> <span>::password</span>]
   <span>:opt</span> [<span>::comment</span> <span>::last-login</span>]))

(println <span>::username</span>)

(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid?
  <span>::user</span>
  {<span>::username</span>   <span>"rich"</span>
   <span>::password</span>   <span>"zegure"</span>
   <span>::comment</span>    <span>"this is a user"</span>
   <span>::last-login</span> 11000}))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>:my-project.users/username ;;this is what fully-qualified keywords look like
true
</pre>


<p>
Spec also encourages the use of qualified keywords: Until recently
in Clojure people would use keywords with a single colon but the two
colons (<code>::</code>) mean that keywords belong to this namespace, in this
case <code>my-project.users</code>. This is another deliberate choice, which is
about creating strong names (or "fully-qualified"), that belong to a
particular namespace, so that we can mix namespaces within the same
map. This means that we can have a map that comes from outside our
system and has its own namespace, and then we add more keys to this
map that belong to our own company's namespace without having to
worry about name clashes. This also helps with data provenance,
because you know that the <code>:subsystem-a/id</code> field is not simply an ID
– it's an ID that was assigned by subsystem-a.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3248f46">
<h3 id="org3248f46">Maps are open</h3>
<div id="text-org3248f46">
<p>
The other interesting thing about specs for maps is that they are
open. For example, if we use the same exact map as before, with the
same fields and an additional field called <code>::age</code>, it's still a valid
<code>::user</code>:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>ns</span> <span>my-project.users</span>
  (<span>:require</span> [clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s]))

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::password</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::last-login</span> number?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::comment</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::user</span>
  (<span>s</span>/keys
   <span>:req</span> [<span>::username</span> <span>::password</span>]
   <span>:opt</span> [<span>::comment</span> <span>::last-login</span>]))

(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid?
  <span>::user</span>
  {<span>::username</span>   <span>"rich"</span>
   <span>::password</span>   <span>"zegure"</span>
   <span>::comment</span>    <span>"this is a user"</span>
   <span>::last-login</span> 11000
   <span>::age</span>        26}))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>true
</pre>


<p>
This happens because spec does not mind if you've defined four keys, if it
sees a fifth key the map does not become invalid. The reason for this is that
when we have a system that accumulates information this accumulation should
not break the system, the code that consumes the map should simply ignore the
keys it doesn't know about. If you're making a system and you're accumulating
extra options, parameters, whatever it is – your code should be able to
continue to run without having to change a lot of code locations, like you
would have to do in an object oriented language or Haskell.
</p>

<p>
This accumulation has also been described by the term "accretion"
and has been discussed in the excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk">Spec-ulation Keynote talk</a> by
Rich Hickey.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a lot of people who use spec to validate things coming from
outside their system need to be more strict with maps, and they have
complained about the openness of maps. We'll talk about proposed solutions to
this issue later.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0b68930">
<h3 id="org0b68930">Explain your problems</h3>
<div id="text-org0b68930">
<p>
Another usage of specs, beyond validation, is "explain" which
essentially can produce errors that tell you what's wrong with your
data. In this case we'll try to create an error by creating a user
that's invalid because it doesn't have a password – a required key:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>ns</span> <span>my-project.users</span>
  (<span>:require</span> [clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s]))

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::password</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::last-login</span> number?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::comment</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::user</span>
  (<span>s</span>/keys
   <span>:req</span> [<span>::username</span> <span>::password</span>]
   <span>:opt</span> [<span>::comment</span> <span>::last-login</span>]))

(<span>s</span>/explain
 <span>::user</span>
 {<span>::username</span>   <span>"rich"</span>
  <span>::comment</span>    <span>"this is a user"</span>})
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We get an ok-ish error that tells us that for the particular map we
passed, the <code>::user</code> spec fails because it doesn't contain <code>::password</code>.
</p>

<pre>val: #:my-project.users{:username "rich", :comment "this is a user"} fails spec: :my-project.users/user predicate: (contains? % :my-project.users/password)
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0d0b9f">
<h3 id="orgb0d0b9f">Sequence specs - regular expressions for data</h3>
<div id="text-orgb0d0b9f">
<p>
A powerful mechanism in spec is sequences. We've already seen <code>s/coll-of</code> which
contains a uniform type of values (a collection of numbers for example) but
sequences are a bit more like regular expressions for data. In this case we
have a sequence with two things, which describe an ingredient for a recipe:
the first thing is a number for the quantity and the second thing is a unit
encoded as a keyword.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require '[clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s])

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::ingredient</span> (<span>s</span>/cat <span>:quantity</span> number? <span>:unit</span> keyword?))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With <code>s/cat</code> we always have to give a name to each position. <code>s/cat</code>
allows to both validate the shape of the value passed, but it also
enables the "conform" operation, which is somehow similar to parsing
or destructuring. If we pass a vector of two elements – a number and
a keyword –  we get back a map with the defined names:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(prn (<span>s</span>/conform <span>::ingredient</span> [2 <span>:teaspoon</span>]))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>{:quantity 2, :unit :teaspoon}
</pre>


<p>
By using some of the other operators which are reminiscent of regular
expressions, this technique can become quite …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>
