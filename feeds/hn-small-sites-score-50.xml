  </div><div><p>A month after the initial Bevy release, and thanks to <strong>87</strong> contributors, <strong>174</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="async-task-system">Async Task System</h2>

<p>Bevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a> for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling <code>some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x))</code>. Rayon then automatically breaks the <code>for_each</code> into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.</p>
<p>Bevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to "real" work done.</p>
<p>We decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:</p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-8-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_1.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 8 core"></p>

<h2 id="initial-web-platform-support">Initial Web Platform Support</h2>
<p>authors: @smokku</p>
<p>(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. </p>
<p>Those limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!</p>
<h3 id="bevy-robbo-playable-here"><a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo">bevy-robbo</a> (<a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mrk-public/bevy-robbo/index.html">playable here</a>)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy-robbo.png" alt="bevy-robbo"></p>
<p>They use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/src/systems/js_render.rs">this Bevy system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/assets/render.js">this JavaScript function</a>. </p>

<h2 id="parallel-queries">Parallel Queries</h2>
<p>authors: @GrantMoyer</p>
<p>Bevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that <em>use</em> queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be <em>iterated</em> in parallel. <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>pool</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ComputeTaskPool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Transform</span><span>&gt;) {</span><span>
    query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>par_iter</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>).</span><span>for_each</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>pool</span><span>, |</span><span>mut </span><span>transform</span><span>| {</span><span>
      transform</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>Vec3</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>));
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new <code>bevy_tasks</code> system. It breaks the query up into 32 "batches" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. </p>
<h2 id="transform-system-rewrite">Transform System Rewrite</h2>
<p>authors: @MarekLg</p>
<pre><code><span>// old
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>translation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Translation, </span><span>rotation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Rotation, </span><span>scale</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Scale</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> translation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> rotation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> scale</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// new
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>transform</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>translation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>scale</span><span>());
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bevy's old transform system used separate <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the "source of truth". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component, which was in turn synced to a global <code>Transform</code> component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like <code>Translation</code> (because less data needs to be accessed)</li>
<li>Theoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access <code>Translation</code> won't block systems accessing <code>Rotation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "individual components" are the source of truth, so <code>LocalTransform</code> is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date "full transform" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.</li>
<li>Very hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.</li>
<li>Setting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: <code>Mat4::look_at()</code>) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent <code>Transform</code> component as the source of truth, and a computed <code>GlobalTransform</code> component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeante/79d25ec3a0e86436e53eb74f3ac82c0c">Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS</a> and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/legion-transform-design-discussion">Amethyst Forum Thread</a>.</p>
<h2 id="joystick-gamepad-input">Joystick/Gamepad Input</h2>
<p>authors: @simpuid</p>
<p>The Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support for most controllers thanks to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs">gilrs</a> library!</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>button_system</span><span>(</span><span>gamepads</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Gamepad</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>button_input</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Input</span><span>&lt;</span><span>GamepadButton</span><span>&gt;&gt;) {

            </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>Pressed right trigger!</span><span>");
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="bevy-ecs-performance-improvements">Bevy ECS Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="generational-entity-ids">Generational Entity IDs</h3>
<p>We changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.</p>
<p>By moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-queries">Read Only Queries</h3>
<p>I implemented "read only" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.</p>
<h3 id="removed-locking-from-world-apis">Removed locking from World apis</h3>
<p>This gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new "read only queries" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled for <code>Queries</code> in systems because a system could have multiple <code>Queries</code>, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately "for-each" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.</p>
<h3 id="direct-component-lookup-in-nanoseconds-smaller-is-better">Direct component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)</h3>
<p>As a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is <em>much</em> faster than it used to be:</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/get_component.svg" alt="get_component graph"></p>
<p>Note that this benchmark used <code>world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code>. <code>query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should have results similar to the <code>hecs</code> results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.</p>

    <date>17 September 2020</date>
      <p>When I joined the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, I inherited a team of around 50 engineers. One of the first things I did was meet each of them for a one-to-one. I was initially resistant, but it was extremely valuable, I’m glad I did it, and I would definitely do it again in a future role.</p>

<h2 id="my-mentors-advice-about-the-content-of-the-meeting">My mentor’s advice about the content of the meeting</h2>

<p>The idea was suggested to me by a mentor, who’d been advised to do it by <em>his</em> mentor, a Rear Admiral, who said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. My mentor gave me some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only.</li>
  <li>This should mostly be about listening – you should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.</li>
  <li>It’s to find out what’s going well and what’s not going well.</li>
  <li>It’s informal, but make sure it’s in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone’s family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship-building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.</li>
  <li>Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-time-was-hard">Making time was hard</h2>

<p>I was initially resistant because of the time commmitment. With a team of ~50, that’s a lot of hours, and I was also working four days a week so each meeting takes up a greater proportion of time. However, once I’d made the decision to do this and announced my intention, it was important to me to follow through, so I made sure to make time.</p>

<p>I scheduled four of these 1:1s a week, starting with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.</p>

<h2 id="i-ran-each-meeting-in-the-same-way">I ran each meeting in the same way</h2>

<p>Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.</p>


<ul>
  <li>I am asking the same questions to everyone</li>
  <li>This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I’m not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let’s make sure we discuss that after this meeting</li>
  <li>This is confidential. If you say something about someone else I’m not going to go and tell them. I may report on ‘what people are saying’, but I’ll say ‘the engineers feel’ or ‘an engineer said’; I won’t say “[Your name] said…”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-going-to-discuss">What we’re going to discuss</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First I’ll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background</li>
  <li>Then, if you like, I’d love you to tell me a bit about yourself – as much or as little as you feel like sharing</li>
  <li>Then we’ll discuss the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
  <li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
  <li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-i-should-know-about">Is there anything I should know about?</h2>

<p>When I asked this question I talked a bit about why I was asking. I explained that I might not necessarily see or know things that may seem apparent to them, and while they should always feel able to bring things to me, now was a good opportunity to do so. It was an opportunity to make sure I’ve heard what’s important to you, what things should change and what things should stay the same.</p>

<p>This question always elicited very interesting responses, from organisational issues, to personal information people felt it was valuable for me to know about them.</p>

<h2 id="i-told-them-what-i-was-planning-to-ask-in-advance">I told them what I was planning to ask in advance</h2>

<p>I put all the information in the meeting invite.</p>

<div>
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
<li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Some people did not read the meeting invite and came with no idea what the meeting was about. Some people had fully prepared and written notes that they then read out to me. Actually people having prepared sometimes was less useful, because sometimes it led the conversation to solutions rather than problems. However it was great that people had really given it some thought.</p>

<h2 id="making-notes-felt-too-much-like-a-promise">Making notes felt too much like a promise</h2>

<p>Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, even though I had said it was information only.</p>

<p>However, I do not have a very good memory, so for all the subsequent ones I made a few notes after each meeting of key themes. This meant I couldn’t do more than two in a row or go straight into another meeting, so it made scheduling slightly harder. These days, people are much more aware of the shorter meeting approach so if doing this again, I’d go for the ‘therapy hour’ – 25 minutes for conversation then 5 minutes for me to make the notes.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-myself">Introducing myself</h2>

<p>In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in <a href="https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/">children’s book publishing</a>, through teaching myself to code, my <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm">masters in Software Systems</a> and then my 15+ year career in programming, infrastructure and operations, technical architecture, and my previous role as <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html">Open Source lead</a>. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job as Technical Director at the FT.</p>

<p>I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don’t normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new Tech Director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.</p>

<p>My mentor had suggested I also say something personal. I think he intended something like “married with two children” (or whatever), but instead, I tried to give a different kind of personal detail, something about my interests. I tried to come up with a different one for each conversation, for example something about my <a href="https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777">cross-stitch hobby</a>.</p>

<p>This part was the hardest part for me, because prior to this I had generally enjoyed keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, so that definitely didn’t cover talking about cross-stitch, or my home life, on a first meeting. However, I had been trying to bring more of my personal self to work, and this part of the intro did lead to some really interesting conversations and I think helped make a better connection.</p>

<p>Of course, these days, when we are all at home, my personal life is in meetings with me, so it’s good I’d already started on that journey!</p>

<p>Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted. Some talked career history, some focused on their hobbies, others were really open about their lives and aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-this">I am so glad I did this</h2>

<p>My mentor was wrong about one thing –&nbsp;none of the conversations were boring.</p>

<p>In my first few months in the new job, I often felt really stretched for time, but I never regretted a single one of these meetings; it was always extremely interesting, my team are brilliant and it was great to meet them one on one, and each conversation always contained some valuable information.</p>

<p>There were two very valuable things about this for me.</p>

<p>The first was getting an idea of what change was needed. These meetings gave me a brilliant insight that wasn’t available elsewhere. Patterns started emerging very quickly, and formed the basis of our <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">tech strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The second was building relationships. A lot of the people I had 1:1s with I would not have come into contact with during the course of the ordinary working week. It would have taken time to meet everyone at socials, and it wouldn’t have been the same quality of conversation. I still feel, two years on, that I know a bit about all the people I had those conversations with, which has felt to me like a good foundation for our subsequent conversations.</p>

<p>It was also good, as someone who is a bit shy, to have names to faces quite quickly and people to say hello to when walking round the office.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-useful-for-my-team">Was it useful for my team?</h2>

<p>About a year later, I asked some of the people with whom I’d had these conversations whether they’d been useful (in an anonymous form).</p>

<p>All of the people who responded said they found the conversation valuable, and some of their comments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It broke down barriers and helped me feel less intimidated about approaching you, whether to talk about work or just to have a general chit chat. You are a very busy person who I wouldn’t ever work with directly so it was good to feel that you knew I existed.”</li>
  <li>“There is hardly any opportunity for me to talk to people in higher position like you except when the team has a big problem. The 1:1 was really casual and I felt really comfortable talking to you. It was a good time to know what kind of person you are. If we didn’t do the 1:1, the answer of the question below “Do you feel able to raise issues with me?” would be “No”.”</li>
  <li>“We sat down when you first started and it was nice to get some one-to-one time because it’s not often you get to do that with a Technical Director. It was nice to raise issues but for me, it was more of an opportunity to understand if I could trust you in the future with raising issues. Raising issues can be difficult and scary so it’s important to know if the person you are raising them to is receptive.”</li>
  <li>“It really showed that you cared about us as humans, and how we fit with the rest of the team. It was also a great opportunity to get to know you”</li>
  <li>“I think often of that conversation”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="did-it-make-them-feel-more-able-to-raise-issues-with-me">Did it make them feel more able to raise issues with me?</h2>

              <h4>Visual rank of your website is as important as your SEO rank.</h4>
              <p>Users make lasting judgments about a website’s appeal within a split second.  This first impression is influential enough to later affect their opinions of a site’s usability and trustworthiness.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind Score and why it matters ?</h4>
              <p>For too long, aesthetics of a website has been dismissed as a superficial concern. That is a mistake. As latest research demonstrates ( See recommended ref) , the visual appeal of a website is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness.</p>
              <p>Have you “fast-tested” your website? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your website to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters.</p>
              <p>Visual Mind score – provides you with a qualitative score about that first impression. It can help you evaluate your website aesthetics and make improvements.</p>
