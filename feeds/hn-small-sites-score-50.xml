<h4 id="a-primer-on-the-cruel-tacit-laws-of-type-level-programming-in-haskell"><em>A primer on the cruel, tacit laws of type-level programming in Haskell</em></h4>

<p>Haskell programs are constructed at the junction of two worlds: one of types, and the other of values. Values are operational run-time entities that are denoted syntactically by <em>terms</em> in the code. To this end, types classify terms. They provide a powerful abstraction to organize data, determine how it should be stored in memory, passed through various operations, and more. On a superficial level, the difference between these worlds is simple: <em>types</em> refer to datatypes, which are either built-in (such as <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code>), or user-declared, for example:</p>

<pre><code>data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
</code></pre>

<p>By comparison, <em>values</em> are denoted by <em>terms</em> those types categorize (such as <code>1</code> and <code>"abc"</code> described by the standard library’s <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types, or <code>Cady</code> and <code>Regina</code> in the case of our user-declared type, <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>). Thus, the term <code>1</code> denotes a value that exists in memory only when the program is run.</p>

<p>In addition to these two worlds, a third, darker, and more elusive underworld of <em>kinds</em> also lurks in the shadows of Haskell programs. Haskell kinds can be as unpredictable and insidious as the soulless alpha-female of an elite high school clique. While daunting, understanding the coaction between these three worlds lays the foundation for type-level programming, a topic worth learning as it strengthens overall Haskell intuition.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/81239044-afe24580-8fd1-11ea-96b0-274cf839e834.png" alt="the haskell type system: a machine of constant, unforgiving judgement and rigid classification"></p>

<h3 id="kindness-is-a-virtue">Kindness is a virtue</h3>

<p>Much like counter-intuitive adolescent social dynamics, mastery of Haskell bears a steep learning curve because of its underlying complexity. It is difficult to wrap one’s head around the language’s typeclass hierarchies, category-theoretic roots, or the intricacies of compiler behavior. However, an intimate understanding of the type system lets programmers look beyond the chaos of code and apply a recognizable template by which to understand it.</p>

<h3 id="kindness-takes-patience">Kindness takes patience</h3>

<p>This topic is also difficult to master because it is both vast and subtle. Ideas underlying type-level programming are scattered across many disconnected resources focused on several corners of the Haskell ecosystem. Authoritative references on the topic (such as relevant library documentation) tend to assume familiarity with domain-specific terminology that may be unknown to non-experts. Due to the paucity of approachable materials on the subject, I’ve attempted to break down type-level programming into explanations of its constituent parts. While I don’t go into extensive depth on any individual section below, I hope to provide a valuable starting point with which readers can explore ideas in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="types-vs-values">Types vs. Values</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, Haskell programs are divided into two worlds: the <em>type-level</em> and the <em>value-level</em>. The <em>type-level</em> refers to the part of a program analyzed by the static type-checking phase during compilation. Since every expression is assigned a type, code is checked against Haskell’s type system to ensure it fits <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>’s specified correctness criteria.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704534-fce9fd80-af27-11ea-9544-13961a56c444.png" alt="types classify terms, just like hostile teens with identity crises classify one another"></p>

<p>If the program is well-typed, the program will compile. However, this type-information evaporates once the compilation process terminates, leaving only <em>values</em> behind at run-time. In this way, types and values can be better distinguished by the phasing distinction, with types being compile-time entities and values being run-time entities.</p>

<p>For example, if a function takes a <code>String</code>, the type-checker doesn’t care if the <code>String</code> has a value denoted by <code>"abc"</code> or <code>"123"</code> or <code>"get in loser"</code>—so long as it’s a <code>String</code>. Type information gets discarded at run-time, leaving only the string’s value (ex.,<code>"get in loser"</code>). In some cases, however, we want the type system to care about what those values are and distinguish between them. The <code>DataKinds</code> extension, which we’ll explore below, lets us do that by allowing us to shove more information about our program into the type system. This lets us add meaning to the value of a <code>String</code> at the type-level, moving them from their usual, strictly run-time existence, into the compile-time phase. The technique allows us to use more information statically in the logical development and abstraction of the program’s behavior. We’re also able to add consequences that can halt compilation if the specific value of <code>String</code> doesn’t conform to the rules we’ve specified, or define classes over them.</p>

<h4 id="distinguishing-types-and-values-in-ghci">Distinguishing types and values in GHCi</h4>

<p>Let’s examine our aforementioned <code>SpringFlingQueen</code> datatype in GHCi. When we query the type of one of its constructors using <code>:t</code> (a handy shorthand for <code>:type</code>), we see that it is indeed of type <code>SpringFlingQueen</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ data SpringFlingQueen = Cady | Regina
λ :t Cady
Cady :: SpringFlingQueen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now consider literals <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>. These are <em>values</em> of a type that parameterizes the <code>Num</code> class:</p>



<p>Typing <code>:t 1</code> into GHCi gives us <code>Num p =&gt; p</code>, indicating that a literal such as <code>1</code> can be of any polymorphic type <code>p</code> as long as the <code>Num</code> type class has instances for that type (for example, <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code> both have <code>Num</code> instances and therefore are valid types that <code>p</code> could be instantiated with). This is possible due to <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Type_inference">type inference</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875834/84704346-ae3c6380-af27-11ea-8078-6f1ddfc7b238.png" alt="type inference can be used to deduce concrete types wherever they're obvious. If a type looks like a mouse, it's a mouse—duh!"></p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>Just like types classify terms, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/decls.html#sect4.1.1">kinds</a> classify types, and therefore are frequently described as “types of types”, or referred to be “one level up.” The “star” syntax (i.e., <code>*</code>) denotes kinds. It is defiantly used in this post despite <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst">recent syntactic changes</a>. A prerequisite for understanding the kind system necessitates comprehending the differences between three pairs of ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Data constructors vs. type constructors:</strong> data constructors create values, whereas type constructors create types. Type constructors take one or more type arguments and produce a datatype when enough arguments are provided. This means that through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Currying">currying</a>, a type constructor can be <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially applied</a>. For example, the list type constructor <code>[]</code> may take a single type argument (ex. <code>String</code>) to denote the elements of the list (i.e., <code>[String]</code>). <code>[String]</code> is simply syntactic sugar for <code>[] String</code>, where the type <code>[]</code> is applied to <code>String</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full vs. partial application</strong> A partially-applied type, like a <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Partial_application">partially-applied function</a>, is one that is missing some of its data constructors. For instance, consider the list type <code>[]</code>. The kind of <code>[]</code> is <code>* -&gt; *</code>. A fully-applied list has data constructors, such as <code>[Int]</code>, and its kind is <code>*</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inhabited types vs. uninhabited types:</strong> An inhabitant of a type is precisely a value of that type. This means that <em>inhabited</em> types refer to the types that contain concrete values, such as the value denoted by the term <code>1 :: Int</code>. This suggests that the type <code>Int</code> is inhabited by value denoted by <code>1</code>. By contrast, <em>uninhabited</em> types refer to type constructors to which no values are abstracted. For instance, <code>Void</code> is uninhabited because it has no data constructors, and thus can not be used to construct a valid term. While <code>Void</code> may seem pointless at first, it can be a useful way to represent that a container is empty (ex., <code>[Void]</code>, which <em>is</em> inhabited by the term <code>[]</code> and the value this term denotes).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How do these ideas relate to the kind system? Well, all fully-applied runtime values are of kind <code>*</code> <em>and</em> they are inhabited. You can confirm this by typing <code>:k Int</code> and <code>:k String</code> in GHCi. However, this doesn’t work the other way around—just because a type is inhabited, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fully-applied (ex., <code>[]</code> is not fully-applied but it <em>is</em> inhabited, and its kind signature is <code>* -&gt; *</code>). Conversely, all partially-applied types are uninhabited (since they don’t correspond to a value), but not all uninhabited types are partially applied. <code>Void</code> for instance is not partially-applied, but it is uninhabited.</p>

<p>To get the hang of this idea, consider the following examples:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Inhabited?</th>
      <th>Fully-applied?</th>
      <th>Kind</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Int</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>String</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>[Int]</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>(,)</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Void</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Either Void Void</code></td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><code>*</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Kind signatures can be specified manually in GHCi using the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#ghc-flag--XKindSignatures"><code>XKindSignatures</code></a> extension. Try extending the above table by investigating the kind signatures of various types.</p>

<h3 id="higher-kinded-types">Higher-kinded types</h3>

<p>Just like there are higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments), there are higher-kinded types (types constructors that take other type constructors as arguments). Type constructors such as <code>[]</code> are a first-class type, but also a higher-kinded type, given they take another type constructor to be reified:</p>



<p>Let’s consider <code>Functor</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :k Functor
Functor :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; Constraint
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> takes a type constructor <code>* -&gt; *</code> and returns a <code>Constraint</code>. Let’s use <code>:info</code> to examine <code>Functor</code> a bit more closely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ :info Functor
class Functor (f :: * -&gt; *) where
  fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
  (&lt;$) :: a -&gt; f b -&gt; f a
  {-# MINIMAL fmap #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Functor ((,,,) a b c) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor ((,,) a b) -- Defined in ‘Data.Orphans’
instance Functor [] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor Maybe -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor IO -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We see that <code>Functor</code> allows type constructors like <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> to have <code>Functor</code> instances, but not <code>Int</code> or <code>String</code>. This is because <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code> are <code>* -&gt; *</code>, while <code>Int</code> has kind <code>*</code>. Similarly, <code>Either</code> has <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, which is why its instance above is parameterized with a type parameter denoting something of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>: <code>Either a</code>.</p>

EC2 instances are the safest choice to make for running server applications as they are highly configurable, scalable and you can change the configuration on demand according to your needs. However, sometimes you do not really need this level of control on your compute instances and that brings us to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail/" target="_blank">AWS Lightsail</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Lightsail as the name suggests is a lightweight version of EC2. Under the hood Lightsail instances are actually EC2 instances, but this is not apparent to the user and unlike the highly configurable EC2, Lightsail comes with a fixed configuration that once you provision cannot be changed. The billing is also a fixed amount per month as opposed to EC2 which is billed by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>To give you a sense of how much less complicated Lightsail is, please take a look at these screenshots of the EC2 dashboard and Lightsail dashboard.</p><figure id="w-node-7afe1c2bdee3-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef82a451ea3cd05dfd4c146_x93boOZlEeQGL9kcVSXPZyGOX3SNQJfDNyRC0qG3jNDCYeySdZpIgBzYgkVDZqq3DhR92f_Eqdp8sG-vIgkwltIW9ExWhshfDSsb-gd2qCah6E5VjydVhGxO4QFRA5qCR2KXqhP5.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-2074947a61a8-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef737f4a33047deb1c0a4a6_ZMr0t2QqxGgPZ-Grg-TIHjpok_ujhoYzyHLQnsGzlSfLJj0wRrKWFMKNnVDwCoOorYJHs6j4aqKz_NgztOFGNSNc9Fw4nKGrwSRVK7E4hQtDkzE7OXIVaQp0lDjXxwjiKkHN1e3c.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>EC2 dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>But we are not here to debate the complexity of EC2 vs Lightsail, so let’s let us talk about the cost.</p><p>An EC2 instance with 2 virtual cores, 4GB RAM and a storage of 80GB costs roughly 37$ a month and a Lightsail instance with the exact same configuration costs 20$ a month which is almost half the cost!</p><p>‍<br></p><p>The only drawback here as previously mentioned is that the instance is fixed and neither the storage nor the compute power can be tweaked later according to spikes in traffic and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>In our case we do not have a need for too much storage on the compute instance, and as for the computing power it was easy for us to simply provision another Lightsail instance when there is an increase in traffic and set it up behind a load balancer. This way our system is still scalable.</p><p><strong>Database instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Choosing a database provider for your application can be a tricky decision, but on a high level there is just one thing that is absolutely required for any database provider - the ability to take regular backups of the DB automatically and the ability to restore the database from one of the backups.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this functionality is provided by AWS RDS along with an array of other capabilities like autoscaling of storage, multiple availability zones, etc. However we did not not really need this level of control over the DB for our simple SaaS product, not to mention the fact that RDS would cost us a minimum of 200$ a month with the lowest acceptable configuration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again our saviour was Lightsail which provides managed Databases with a fixed storage at very cheap prices. Only MySQL and PostgreSQL are available though which was fine with us since I am quite comfortable with MySQL. We have currently provisioned one MySQL DB with 2 vCPUS, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD and it costs us 60$ a month.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>And as mentioned before Lightsail provides the basic capabilities of backups and restoration.</p><figure id="w-node-e1f43dee380f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef731c812136072299e133c_Q2n6wprxbcqgh5vI97YqjWYkOYV52HGzRtHXIQFfpgxwlHkGaO8YDv3aO3V-PwM2SI4qxPty6ZMlK0siv1-lAizSl9hf_6RASDqzNrSfEmIeMdu8UeSTsRhu4Sk1Ofg6Uw8CPPuK.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Database restoration from recent backup</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><div><p>The drawback here is that the DB will not scale automatically so your will have to make sure that your application does not use storage beyond what is available in the instance you select. We do this by regularly purging our Database of data that is older than X days and data that belongs to users who churned from our app more than X days ago and haven’t come back since.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Caching instances</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>For our application we needed a Caching layer as well as the ability to queue up jobs that can be executed asynchronously. The seasoned folks here might have realised that the best tool to use for this is Redis and AWS has a service called ElastiCache which is Redis under the hood.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Once again this would be a very safe choice to make because it is completely managed and scalable. Our need was a Redis instance with at least 6GB of memory and 2vCPUs and if we went with ElastiCache our cost would roughly come out to be 112$ a month, not to mention the additional cost of running our async workers somewhere else.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>I might sound like a broken record at this point but what we ended up doing was to provision a Lightsail instance with 2vCPUs and 8GB of memory for the cost of 40$ a month and installed an open source version of Redis on this instance. We also use the same instance to run our asynchronous workers which read from the Redis queue and execute jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So what is the drawback? Well since it is not a managed service, you would have to monitor the Redis server yourself. There are many tools out there that help you do this and the one I would recommend is<a href="http://prometheus.io/" target="_blank"> prometheus.io</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This means that you have to do a little bit of extra work to setup metrics collection from your Redis instance and use a grafana dashboard where you can view these metrics, but this extra work saves a lot of money in the long run and you get to look at a super cool dashboard like this one</p><figure id="w-node-ed9ef23d383f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b6832df460f9189c1ef_8fAYGJqB0CXvglSTkg-wXPXqpKi2e3fusNyMcOaiepfnZ-dC1kjn2Do44sILw5lbKOSISB1CMTEdCzyqBcyggDwK4tJcDEA17xkWXb2J1tUjLHBJgtMa_t3ekfIUfOiImx5IaZd6.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Grafana dashboard for monitoring redis instance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CDN</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Our application requires a javascript file to be loaded into the websites of our customers. This JS file gets a ton of traffic because this traffic scales according to how many visitors our customers get. Now this can be scary because it means we really had no idea how many requests the JS file might actually end up receiving so we hesitated to go with CloudFront which is the goto solution for a CDN on AWS.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>So we ended up taking an entirely different approach for this. Our application is a Shopify app and during the process of building the application we created a Shopify store. Every Shopify store gets its own personal CDN where you can manually upload anything and it will be served over the Shopify CDN. So we minified and uploaded our JS file to the CDN of our Shopify store and now we serve 20000 Shopify stores using this method at zero cost.</p><figure id="w-node-78b80f124ebd-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef71b68374cfd3932d127f5_z2vfALB6_5FJXMp4al-65PIczwKOE-wUb0TubqBXAFMiu0rnqPEKGAOl12Saf0Xn-Ay1DjWL7wIj7Vby1sNPfLHkpuXzHf17ytoJ5gQvql13DZl1BsIV2rJPeHgfnCnIdezWiddG.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Shopify CDN&nbsp;that is free of cost</figcaption></figure><p>There is a glaring drawback to this approach. The Shopify store CDN does not provide an API that you can use to programmatically upload files and it has to be done manually. Also unlike CloudFront, there is no option of invalidating a file once it is uploaded. So If you have to make updates to your file you would have to upload a new file and migrate all of your existing users to this new file.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><p>This might sound like a big drawback, but it actually took me an hour to whip up a script that updates the JS file for all our existing 20000 stores to the updated JS file that I provide. So whenever I make a new release to this JS file, I simply upload a new file manually to the CDN, then take that file as the input and run this script and we re live! This approach works for us because we do not make too many releases to the JS&nbsp;file to begin with.</p><p><strong>Web server + load balancer</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>Every application requires the ability to route requests coming to their domain or subdomain to various applications running under the hood. The best way to do this is to use AWS ELB which can be used to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>This sounds quite fancy, but all we needed for our product was 4 things</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Serving static files for our application dashboard</li><li>Distribute traffic among different Lightsail instances based on the path of the incoming URL</li><li>Load balance traffic that comes from our Merchants Shopify stores amongst N identical Lightsail instances.</li><li>Rate limiting of requests to prevent DDOS attacks.</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><p>All of this can be done using NGINX which is a great piece of software and is quite robust even with the default settings that it comes with.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So we simply installed a stable version of NGINX on one of our existing Lightsail instances which was already being used to host one of our server applications. We also use<a href="http://amplify.nginx.com/" target="_blank"> amplify.nginx.com</a> for monitoring it. This setup is pretty much equivalent to using a managed service at zero cost.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-26b2c44e15ee-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5ef730c34b26677e785fa7ea_w67-tKkFsy_LekSEhO_PXqnHGxDiREqENBgMBaEAOqotyjEDJoKXRk6Wpd5K86OOv2z_S-ejGOnL37l6lj6MWqE_x2ZvrIZ4FCQraAC1uDWMne7yi0Fme4Jap2sp2uH2zrKdvpTz.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Amplify dashboard for monitoring health of the NGINX server</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li>Use lightsail instances (20$ per instance) instead of EC2 instances (37$ per instance)</li><li>Use a lightsail database (60$ per DB) instead of RDS (200$ per DB)</li><li>Use a self hosted redis server on a compute instance (40$) instead of ElastiCache (112$)&nbsp;</li><li>If feasible, use a free CDN (cost savings depends on traffic size)</li><li>Use a self hosted NGINX server (20$ fixed cost) instead of ELB (cost depends on traffic and usage)</li></ul><p><strong>Closing notes</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong><br></p><p>I would like to put emphasis on the fact that we are a micro-SaaS product that solves a small and specific use case and therefore this kind of AWS setup worked for us.

   <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
   <p>This specification uses pluggable protocols, with QUIC <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-quic-transport">[QUIC-TRANSPORT]</a> as
one such protocol, to send data to and receive data from servers. It can be
used like WebSockets but with support for multiple streams, unidirectional
streams, out-of-order delivery, and reliable as well as unreliable transport.</p>
   <p role="note"><span>Note:</span> The API presented in this specification represents a preliminary proposal
based on work-in-progress within the IETF QUIC WG. Since the QUIC transport
specification is a work-in-progress, both the protocol and API are likely to
change significantly going forward.</p>
   <h2 data-level="2" id="conformance"><span>2. </span><span>Conformance</span><a href="#conformance"></a></h2>
   <p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines,
diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
   <p>The key words <em>MUST</em> and <em>SHOULD</em> are to be interpreted as described in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-rfc2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>
   <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product:
the user agent that implements the interfaces that it contains.</p>
   <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
   <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this
specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript
Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification <a data-link-type="biblio" href="#biblio-webidl">[WEBIDL]</a>, as this
specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

 datagrams in favor of newer datagrams. The number of datagrams to queue
 should be kept small enough to avoid adding significant latency to packet
 delivery when the stream is being read slowly (due to the reader being slow)
 but large enough to avoid dropping packets when for the stream is not read
 for short periods of time (due to the reader being paused).</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A bit more than four years ago I started the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">xi-editor</a> project. Now I have placed it on the back burner (though there is still some activity from the open source community).</p>

<p>The original goal was to deliver a very high quality editing experience. To this end, the project spent a rather large number of “novelty points”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rust as the implementation language for the core.</li>
  <li>A rope data structure for text storage.</li>
  <li>A multiprocess architecture, with front-end and plug-ins each with their own process.</li>
  <li>Fully embracing async design.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> as a mechanism for concurrent modification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I <em>also</em> believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.</p>

<p>I’ve written the <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">CRDT part of this retrospective</a> already, as a comment in response to a Github issue. That prompted good <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">discussion</a> on Hacker News. In this post, I will touch again on CRDT but will focus on the other aspects of the system design.</p>

<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>

<p>The original motivation for xi came from working on the Android text stack, and confronting two problems in particular. One, text editing would become very slow as the text buffer got bigger. Two, there were a number of concurrency bugs in the interface between the EditText widget and the keyboard (input method editor).</p>

<p>The culprit of the first problem turned out to be the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/SpanWatcher">SpanWatcher</a> interface, combined with the fact that modern keyboards like to put a spelling correction span on each word. When you insert a character, all the successive spans bump their locations up by one, and then you have to send onSpanChanged for each of those spans to all the watchers. Combined with the fact that the spans data structure had a naive O(n) implementation, and the whole thing was quadratic or worse.</p>

<p>The concurrency bugs boil down to synchronizing edits across two different processes, because the keyboard is a different process than the application hosting the EditText widget. Thus, when you send an update (to move the cursor, for example) and the text on the other side is changing concurrently, it’s ambiguous whether it refers to the old or new location. This was handled in an “almost correct” style, with timeouts for housekeeping updates to minimize the chance of a race. A nice manifestation of that is that swiping the cursor slowly through text containing complex emoji could cause flashes of the emoji breaking.</p>

<p>These problems have a unifying thread: in both cases there are small diffs to the text, but then the data structures and protocols handled these diffs in a less than optimal way, leading to both performance and correctness bugs.</p>

<p>To a large extent, xi started as an exploration into the “right way” to handle text editing operations. In the case of the concurrency bugs, I was hoping to find a general, powerful technique to facilitate concurrent text editing in a distributed-ish system. While most of the Operational Transformation literature is focused on multiple users collaboratively editing a document, I was hoping that other text manipulations (like an application enforcing credit card formatting on a text input field) could fit into the general framework.</p>

<p>That was also the time I was starting to get heavily into Rust, so it made natural sense to start prototyping a new green-field text editing engine. How would you “solve text” if you were free of backwards compatibility constraints (a huge problem in Android)?</p>

<p>When I started, I knew that Operational Transformation was a solution for collaborative editing, but had a reputation for being complex and finicky. I had no idea how deep the rabbithole would be of OT and then CRDT. Much of that story is told in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883">CRDT discussion</a> previously linked.</p>

<h2 id="the-lure-of-modular-software">The lure of modular software</h2>

<p>There is an extremely long history of people trying to build software as composable modules connected by some kind of inter-module communication fabric. Historical examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCE/RPC">DCE/RPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">Corba</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo_(GNOME)">Bonobo</a>, and more recently things like <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">Sandstorm</a> and <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/modular/module">Fuchsia Modular</a>. There are some partial successes, including <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Binder">Binder</a> on Android, but this is still mostly an unrealized vision. (Regarding Binder, it evolved from a much more idealistic vision, and I strongly recommend reading this 2006 interview about <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/13674/introduction-to-openbinder-and-interview-with-dianne-hackborn/">OpenBinder</a>).</p>

<p>When I started xi, there were signs we were getting there. Microservices were becoming popular in the Internet world, and of course all Web apps have a client/server boundary. Within Google, <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> was working fairly well, as was the internal process separation within Chrome. In Unix land, there’s a long history of the terminal itself presenting a GUI (if primitive, though gaining features such as color and mouse). There’s also the tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and then, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS</a> and X11.</p>

<p>I think one of the strongest positive models was the database / business logic split, which is arguably the most successful example of process separation. In this model, the database is responsible for performance and integrity, and the business logic is in a separate process, so it can safely do things like crash and hang. I very much thought of xi-core as a database-like engine, capable of handling concurrent text modification much like a database handles transactions.</p>

<p>Building software in such a modular way requires two things: first, infrastructure to support remote procedure calls (including serialization of the requests and data), and second, well-defined interfaces. Towards the end of 2017, I saw the goal of xi-editor as <em>primarily</em> being about defining the interfaces needed for large scale text editing, and that this work could endure over a long period of time even as details of the implementation changed.</p>

<p>For the infrastructure, we chose JSON (about which more below) and hand-rolled our own xi-rpc layer (based on JSON-RPC). It turns out there are a lot of details to get right, including dealing with error conditions, negotiating when two ends of the protocol aren’t exactly on the same version, etc.</p>

<p>One of the bolder design decisions in xi was to have a process separation between front-end and core. This was inspired in part by <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, in which everything is a plugin, even GUI. But the main motivation was to build GUI applications using Rust, even though at the time Rust was nowhere near capable of native GUI. The idea is that you use the best GUI technology of the platform, and communicate via async pipes.</p>

<p>One argument for process separation is to improve overall system reliability. For example, Chrome has a process per tab, and if the process crashes, all you get is an “Aw, snap” without bringing the whole browser down. I think it’s worth asking the question: is it useful to have the front-end continue after the core crashes, or the other way around? I think probably not; in the latter case it might be able to safely save the file, but you can also do that by frequently checkpointing.</p>

<p>Looking back, I see much of the promise of modular software as addressing goals related to project management, not technical excellence. Ideally, once you’ve defined an inter-module architecture, then smaller teams can be responsible for their own module, and the cost of coordination goes down. I think this type of project management structure is especially appealing to large companies, who otherwise find it difficult to manage larger projects. And the tax of greater overall complexity is often manageable, as these big companies tend to have more resources.</p>

<h3 id="json">JSON</h3>

<p>The choice of JSON was controversial from the start. It did end up being a source of friction, but for surprising reasons.</p>

<p>The original vision was to write plug-ins in any language, especially for things like language servers that would be best developed in the language of that ecosystem. This is the main reason I chose JSON, because I expected there would be high quality implementations in every viable language.</p>

<p>Many people complained about the fact that JSON escapes strings, and suggested alternatives such as <a href="https://msgpack.org/index.html">MessagePack</a>. But I knew that the speed of raw JSON parsing was a solved problem, with a number of extremely high performance implementations (<a href="https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson">simdjson</a> is a good example).</p>

<p>Even so, aside from the general problems of modular software as described above, JSON was the source of two additional problems. For one, <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-mac/issues/102">JSON in Swift is shockingly slow</a>. There are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/rearchitecting-jsonencoder-to-be-much-faster/28139">discussions on improving it</a> but it’s still a problem. This is surprising to me considering how important it is in many workloads, and the fact that it’s clearly possible to write a high performance JSON implementation.</p>

<p>Second, on the Rust side, while <a href="https://serde.rs/">serde</a> is quite fast and very convenient (thanks to proc macros), when serializing a large number of complex structures, it bloats code size considerably. The xi core is 9.3 megabytes in a Linux release build (debug is an eye-watering 88MB), and a great deal of that bloat is serialization. There is work to reduce this, including <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/miniserde">miniserde</a> and <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde">nanoserde</a>, but serde is still by far the most mainstream.</p>

<p>I believe it’s possible to do performant, clean JSON across most languages, but people should know, we’re not there yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-rope">The rope</h2>

<p>There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope. I would consider the first unsuitable for the goals of xi-editor as it doesn’t scale well to large documents, though its simplicity is appealing, and memcpy is fast these days; if you know your document is always under a megabyte or so, it’s probably the best choice.</p>

<p>Array of lines has performance failure modes, most notably very long lines. Similarly, many good editors have been written using piece tables, but I’m not a huge fan; performance is very good when first opening the file, but degrades over time.</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of the rope as a data structure is its excellent …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>For the past decade, Iâ€™ve run an online portfolio business on the side called <a href="https://foliohd.com/" target="_blank">FolioHD</a>. (You get a subdomain on the platform to host your portfolio, like mine at <a href="http://watilo.foliohd.com/">watilo.foliohd.com</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no insight into the offending content, and the offending content can be anything from a nippleÂ&nbsp;to now apparently <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/23/project-veritas-facebook-sting-moderators-brag-abo/" target="_blank">even a MAGA hat</a>.</p>
<p>Now I am personally blocked on Instagram from liking photos or sending DMs. I canâ€™t sign into my company Instagram account. And Facebook has reached into my Pageâ€™s support inbox and removed private message between myself and customers.<br></p><p><b>How I noticed</b></p><p>A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through my personal Instagram and double-tapped a photo.

<p>Since Facebook is blocking links, that auto-reply no longer gets sent.</p>
<p>Any social posts created through a Buffer-style service, even using a bitly link, gets posted briefly, then removed, with no notice.</p>
<p>And the worst part: there is no way to resolve this.</p>
<p>Now my customers can no longer share links to their websites within the Facebook ecosystem. They had nothing to do with this, and yet their businesses are being affected.<br></p><p><b>My ask</b></p><p>My request to Facebook would be to reconsider how they handle sites with user-generated content, in the same way Google handles it in their index. If a subdomain contains offending content, it shouldnâ€™t poison the root domain and every other subdomain.</p>
<p>And Facebook should probably never weasel their way into private company inboxes to remove content retroactively. You break the trust of any business by pulling these kind of moves. How can we rely on you for anything if your censorship is a moving target?</p>
<p>And if anyone knows how to get Facebook to fix this, please let me know. Short of filing a lawsuit, Iâ€™m not sure how to get this resolved.<br></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>A digital feed is an online stream of content which gets updated as new content is pushed by the feed’s sources. Generally, content is created by users on the social media platform, to be consumed by their followers.</p>
<p>All popular social media platforms feature some type of feed: Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook. Operators of these platforms benefit from increased engagement by their users, so they employ techniques designed to achieve that end. Unfortunately, they often do so at the expense of their users’ well-being. Below are 7 rules to help you retain control over your screen time, without having to leave social media for good, ordered from most important to least important.</p>
<h2 id="rule-1-avoid-non-chronological-feeds">Rule #1: Avoid non-chronological feeds</h2>
<p>On most online platforms, the order of content is determined by an algorithm designed to maximize user engagement, i.e. addict you and keep you looking at ads for as long as possible. Examples: Facebook news feed, Twitter “top tweets”, Instagram explore tab, Tiktok.</p>

<p>Your phone is always within your reach. Access feeds only on your laptop, in order not to condition yourself to constantly check it. Don’t install social media or video apps on your phone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-3-follow-with-purpose">Rule #3: Follow with purpose</h2>
<p>Your digital experience changes with each new person/source you follow. Be mindful about the utility of the information you would obtain before following a new source.</p>
<h2 id="rule-4-limit-the-number-of-peoplethings-you-follow">Rule #4: Limit the number of people/things you follow</h2>
<p>The amount of content you will have to go through increases roughly linearly with the number of sources you follow. You probably won’t see everything your 500 followees share—maybe it’s time to unfollow some of them.</p>
<h2 id="rule-5-schedule-and-limit-your-exposure">Rule #5: Schedule and limit your exposure</h2>
<p>Your brain has a limited capacity to process and hold information. Schedule a certain hour of the day to receive it, and don’t surpass it. Example: No more than 30 minutes of social media, restricted to 10–11 am.</p>
<h2 id="rule-6-block-generously-and-ruthlessly">Rule #6: Block generously and ruthlessly</h2>
<p>If you don’t like what you’re seeing, block or unfollow <em>immediately</em>. This is the hardest when someone posts content that is sometimes useful, but otherwise annoying too. Generally, we put up with it for too long until we block someone.</p>
<h2 id="rule-7-mute-words">Rule #7: Mute words</h2>
<p>Avoid toxic memes by muting related words, e.g. Trump, ISIS. This will filter out any post that contains that word. Click <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords">here</a> to do it on Twitter now—it’s easy.</p>
<p>Follow these simple set of rules, and restore your control over social media and your digital experience in no time.</p>

<p><span>Initial publication: June 27, 2020</span></p><hr>

<p>
	I've <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previously discussed</a> how the PlayStation 2 doesn't have any good entry-point software exploits for launching homebrew. You need to either purchase a memory card with an exploit pre-installed (or a memory card to USB adapter), a HDD expansion bay (not available to slim consoles), open up the console to block the disc tray sensors, or install a modchip. For the best selling console of all time, it deserves better hacks.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attempt to solve this problem was to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">exploit the BASIC interpreter</a> that came bundeld with early PAL region PS2s. Although I was successful at producing the first software based entry-point exploit that can be triggered using only hardware that came with the console, the attack was largely criticized due to the requirement of having to enter the payload manually through the controller or keyboard, and limitation of being PAL only. I decided to write-off that exploit as being impractical, and so the hunt continued for a better attack scenario for the PlayStation 2.
</p>

<p>
	The PlayStation 2 has other sources of untrusted input that we could attack; games which support online multiplayer or USB storage could almost definitely be exploited. But unlike say the Nintendo 64, where we don't really have any other choice but to resort to <a href="https://cturt.github.io/shogihax.html">exploiting games over interfaces like modems</a>, the PlayStation 2 has one key difference: its primary input is optical media (CD / DVD discs), a format which anyone can easily burn with readily available consumer hardware. This leaves an interesting question which I've wanted to solve since I was a child:
</p>

<p>
	Is it possible to just burn our own homebrew games and launch them on an unmodified console the same way we would launch official discs (without going through any user interaction like disc swapping or triggering a network exploit in a game)?
</p>



<p>
	Ultimately, I was successfully able to achieve my goal by exploiting the console's DVD player functionality. This blog post will describe the technical details and process of reversing and exploiting the DVD player. Loading <a href="#backup">backups of commercial games is also possible</a>. All of my code is <a href="https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot">available on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ez0y-hz3VuM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<br>

<h2>DVD video player attack surface</h2>
<p>
	Obviously we can't just burn a disc containing an ELF file and expect the PS2 to boot it; we'll need to exploit some kind of software vulnerability related to parsing of controlled data. The console supports playing burned DVD video discs, which exposes significant attack surface we could potentially exploit to achieve our goal.
</p>

<p>
	If we think about what a DVD Video consists of there are quite a few main components, each with the potential for vulnerabilities:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>UDF filesystem</li>
	<li>DVD Video metadata / subtitles</li>
	<li>Audio and video decoding</li>
	<li>Interaction machine</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Whilst the complete DVD Video specification is unfortunately behind a paywall, it is comprised largely of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Video#Video_data">open formats like MPEG</a>, just bundled together in a proprietary container format (VOB). For the proprietary aspects there are some freely accessible unofficial references.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format is probably the simplest format used, and is responsible for storing the metadata that links the video files together.
</p>

<p>
	The interaction machine is what allows for interactive menus and games in DVD Videos. It has <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Inside_DVD-Video/Instruction_Set_Details">32 groups of instructions</a>, and is interesting because it could potentially be used to dynamically manipulate internal memory state to prime an exploit, or it could be used to create a universal DVD with a menu which allows you to select your firmware version and trigger the appropriate exploit.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
	Clearly it's not practical to do most of our testing on the real hardware since burning hundreds of test discs would be wasteful and time inefficient. We need an emulator with some debugger support, which is where we hit our first roadblock: the most popular emulator for PlayStation 2, PCSX2, <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/issues/1981">does not support playing DVD Videos</a>, and no one is interested in adding support.
</p>

<p>
	I'd like to thank krHacken for helping me out with that first roadblock. It turns out that PCSX2 does support the DVD player; it just can't load it automatically since it's located in encrypted storage and PCSX2 does not support the decryption. There are public tools which can <a href="https://github.com/xfwcfw/kelftool">decrypt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmikaelkael/eromdir">extract</a> the DVD player from EROM storage. It can then be repacked into an ELF for easy loading into PCSX2.
</p>

<p>
	Due to the large number of different PlayStation 2 models released, each with slightly different DVD player firmwares (&gt; 50...), I will focus on a single DVD player for the duration of this article: 3.10E (configured with English language in PS2 settings), as it happens to be the firmware for the console I own. Update: apparently the 3.10E exploit described here works on 3.10U console with no changes.
</p>

<p>
	I will continue to use Ghidra for decompilation as I've been using throughout my <a href="https://cturt.github.io/ps2-yabasic.html">previous</a> articles. The DVD player does not contain any symbols so all names in code snippets were assigned by me through reverse engineering.
</p>

<br>

<h2>Disc controlled data</h2>
<p>
	The first file a DVD player will attempt to read is <code>VIDEO_TS.IFO</code>. Searching memory for contents of the file and then setting memory write breakpoints there to track back where it was written we quickly locate the API that reads disc contents used by the IFO parsing code, <code>getDiscByte</code> at <code>0x25c920</code>. It's a stream reader which caches a number of sectors into a RAM buffer, and then automatically seeks more data once needed:
</p>

<pre><code>byte getDiscByte(void) {
	byte ret;
	
	if (currentDiscBytePointer &lt; endDiscBytePointer) {
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	else {
		currentDiscBytePointer = &amp;buffer;
		setOffset = setOffset + numberOfSectorsRead;
		getDiscByteInternal();
		ret = *currentDiscBytePointer;
	}
	currentDiscBytePointer = currentDiscBytePointer + 1;
	return ret;
}
</code></pre>



<p>
	From searching calls to this, we can also quickly find wrappers that fetch data of larger sizes: <code>getDiscU16</code> (<code>0x25c980</code>), <code>getDiscU32</code> (<code>0x25c9b8</code>), and <code>getDiscData</code> (<code>0x25c9f0</code>), which is the most interesting as it reads an arbitrary length of data:
</p>

<pre><code>void getDiscData(uint size, byte *destination) {
	byte b;
	uint i;
	
	i = 0;
	if (size != 0) {
		do {
			i = i + 1;
			b = getDiscByte();
			*destination = b;
			destination = destination + 1;
		} while (i &lt; size);
	}
	return;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Large reads</h2>
<p>
	The first thing I did was search for calls to <code>getDiscData</code> in the hope of finding one with controllable size, and no bounds checking.
</p>

<p>
	Sure enough, we very quickly identify about 4 blatant buffer overflow vulnerabilities of this nature. Relating back to the <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html">IFO</a> file format, we can see that there are numerous 16-bit array lengths which are needed to parse the variably sized data structures in the file. The DVD player mistakenly only ever expects the maximum lengths allowed by the DVD specification, and so it is missing checks to reject discs with larger lengths. Since all of the copies are done on statically allocated memory buffers, specifying larger than allowed lengths will cause buffer overflows. For example, below is decompilation for the one at <code>0x25b3bc</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>		large1 = getDiscU16();
		large2 = getDiscU16();
		large3 = getDiscU16();
		ignored = getDiscU16();
		getDiscData(((uint)large1 + (uint)large2 + (uint)large3) * 8, &amp;DAT_0140bdd4);</code></pre>



<p>
	This one is the most interesting because it allows the largest possible copy size (<code>0xffff * 3 * 8 = 0x17FFE8</code> bytes) of all the <code>getDiscData</code> buffer overflows. It copies into the statically allocated buffer at <code>0x0140bdd4</code>, and so by specifying the maximum possible copy size we gain control over the address space from <code>0x140bdd4</code> to <code>0x158BDBC</code> (<code>0x140bdd4 + 0x17FFE8</code>).
</p>

<br>

<h2>Corruption from the large reads</h2>
<p>
	As you can see, we can control quite a large region of memory using the above vulnerability. However, scanning through that memory is initially very disappointing; there are very few pointers, and none of them look particularly interesting to corrupt!
</p>

<p>
	Although there are no interesting pointers in this region, there are some indexes, which if corrupted could lead to further out of bounds memory corruption.
</p>

<p>
	Note that large reads like this won't always copy contiguous data from the IFO file, as sectors will start repeating once we exceed the file size, but generally assume that all data written by a <code>getDiscData</code> call can be controlled as it originates from <i>somewhere</i> on the disc. Also, after writing a certain amount, we may overflow into internal state used by <code>getDiscByte</code> functions, but we will get to this later.
</p>

<br>

<h3>OOB call</h3>
<p>
	At <code>0x25e388</code> we have this call to an entry in a function pointer array, where we can control the 16-bit <code>fpIndex</code> at <code>0x141284a</code> from the overflow:
</p>

<pre><code>(*(code *)(&amp;PTR_LAB_005b9d40)[(uint)fpIndex])(puVar6 + ((uint)DAT_01412841 - 1) * 8);</code></pre>



<p>
	This allows us to jump to the address stored anywhere from <code>0x5b9d40</code> up to <code>0x5b9d40 + 0xffff * 4 = 0x5F9D3C</code>.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Exploiting OOB call</h4>
<p>
	This primitive is not quite ideal, as none of our overflow bugs allow us to control the memory where the jump targets are read from. Worse still, most of this memory region is mapped from a read-only section of the DVD Player, so it's unlikely that we can influence the contents of this memory region without another bug.
</p>

<p>
	After the function pointers, we do some see some addresses for <code>switch</code> <code>case</code> labels, which is slightly interesting because that allows us to jump into the middle of a function and execute its epilogue without having executed its prologue, allowing us to misalign the stack pointer and return to an unexpected value on the stack. I went through all of these and unfortunately I was only ever able to use that to jump to <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Finally after the code pointers, we see read only string data. Interestingly, this data can be changed by switching languages in the PS2 menu, which gives greater hope for finding at least 1 usable jump target in every firmware version, however it unfortunately comes at the cost of forcing the user to reconfigure their language.

</p>



    
<p>Cache-oblivious algorithms seemed incredible to me when I first heard about it in 6.854 (Advanced Algorithms). It’s relatively straightforward to imagine algorithms that utilizes information about page size $B$ and cache size $M$ to create efficient data structures. However, cache-oblivious algorithms are algorithms that achieve similar efficiencies <em>without knowing $B$ or $M$</em>. That means the same cache-oblivious algorithm can be ran on computers with different cache or page sizes and still achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as one that is tailored to that specific cache. The key to many of these algorithms is a recursive, fractal-like idea. I’ll describe a cache-oblivious algorithm for searching in a list of integers.</p>

<p>Here’s the set up. (TLDR at bottom) A program executes on the processor, but the input data resides on the disk. We can think of a disk as a really long linear array of data, but accessing it is really expensive. So, we instead invent this notion of a cache - a layer of memory of $M$ bits that is much smaller, but a lot faster to read/write to. For performance reasons, we will divide the disk and cache into blocks of $B$ bits, called pages, and we will transfer data between cache and disk a page at a time.</p>
<p>This cache sits between the processor and the disk, and the processor will never directly read or write to the disk. When the processor wants to read a piece of data that is not on the cache (this is called a cache miss), it will trigger some mechanism that copies the relevant page from the disk to the cache first, <em>evicting another page if the cache is full</em>, and then read from the cache.</p>
<p>How might this help? Well, trivially, if the entire set of data that the program needs fits in the cache, conceivably the processor could have fetched it all in the cache, paid the one-off cost, and then for the rest of the program the processor will never have to pay the expensive cost of reading from disk. Of course most programs require more data than that, and so we want to design algorithms that minimize cache misses.</p>
<h2 id="cache-management">Cache management</h2>
<p>However, the way computers are set up restricts the tools we have to achieve this. Programs executing on the processor have no explicit control over the cache. Instead, conceptually, programs continue to send read and write requests to the disk as though there is no cache. The processor intercepts these requests, and performs the necessary cache operations to serve the information. In other words, the cache is transparent to programs.  Thus, the task of reducing cache misses decomposes into two orthogonal components: writing efficient algorithms by cleverly ordering or specifying memory accesses, and efficient cache management.</p>
<p>For example, an efficient algorithm might try to shuffle memory accesses around so that memory accesses to a particular memory address are clumped together, increasing the likelihood that there will be a cache hit. In fact, because of the paging system, it would doubly help if memory accesses to the same <em>spatial region</em> are clumped together, because there’s a chance they’ll be on the same page.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efficient cache management entails trying to predict which piece of data to evict from the cache when there is a cache miss and we want to load more data into an already full cache. Since we’re focusing on the algorithm this article, we assume that the cache manager has magic oracle powers that lets it discard <em>optimally</em>, so from the algorithm design standpoint, if there exists a sequence of cache loads/writes that achieves our desired performance, we assume that the cache manager will do it. It turns out that this is not unreasonable, because simple techniques such as the Least Recently Used algorithm work <em>really</em> well. (An exposition on this deserves its own article.)</p>
<p>To summarize, the components of the external memory model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk, effectively unbounded in size, stores data in pages of size $B$</li>
<li>Cache, stores $M/B$ pages, each page has size $B$</li>
<li>Processor executes algorithm, also manages cache.</li>
<li>Algorithm runs on the processor. When data is needed, the processor transparently loads the required page into the cache if there’s a cache miss, or serve the cached data if there isn’t</li>
</ul>
<p>There are efficient algorithms that require explicit knowledge of $B$ and $M$, and there cache-oblivous algorithms that are just as efficient, but some how do not. That is to say, the algorithm performs the same actions and requests the same sequence of memory accesses, that works efficiently no matter what size $B$ and $M$ really are. We’ll take a close look at the latter here.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to scan through a list of $N$ integers, to do some task, say finding the maximum. If the list occupy a contiguous block of memory on the disk, this can be done efficiently by loading pages one at a time, and scanning through the page before loading the next page. This thus takes $O(N/B)$ disk accesses, and is quite clearly optimal.</p>
<p>Suppose the algorithm does not know $B$. It can achieve the same efficiency by simply reading the elements of the list in order. The CPU will then fetch the first page to the cache, containing elements $0$ to $B-1$ and pass it to the program, and then when the program requires element $B$, it’ll read in the next page, which contains elements $B$ to $2B-1$, possibly overwriting the earlier page. This will just continue until all $N/B$ pages are read. This is cache-oblivious, because the algorithm of sequentially reading the elements is the same regardless of what $B$ is.</p>
<p>Note that in this example, it is essential that the list is stored in a contiguous block of memory. Had the elements been scattered around like in a linked-list, each access could potentially trigger a cache miss, since there’s no guarantee that neighboring elements will be on the same page. This may seem obvious, but this is the main mechanism by which we can write efficient algorithms - coming up with efficient layouts of data.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the problem of searching for an integer in a list. We’ll examine three ways of doing this.</p>
<h2 id="inefficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-binary-search">Inefficient cache-oblivious algorithm: Binary search</h2>
<p>Let’s assume the data is sorted in a list, and packed contiguously on the disk. A possible algorithm is then to perform binary search, which typically takes $O(\log N)$ reads. The binary search can be viewed a successively narrowing an interval in which the query value may reside in. However, once the interval that the binary search is narrowing is $O(B)$, the entire interval may reside in a page, and no further page accesses are required. Thus, we require only $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. Notice that this is a cache-oblivious algorithm because the algorithm doesn’t know what $B$ is - to the algorithm, it’s just running a standard binary search.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-but-not-cache-oblivious-b-trees">Efficient, but not cache-oblivious: B-trees</h2>
<p>Suppose we know $B$ ahead of time. We can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses. We arrange the list in the format of a B-tree, a generalized BST. Similar to a BST, each subtree of a B-tree corresponds to a contiguous subset of the elements of the list when sorted by value. However, each node $V$ of the tree contains not one, but $B$ elements, which splits the interval corresponding to the subtree rooted at node $V$ into not 2, but $B+1$ intervals. Then, we can traverse down the BST, and each time we go down one level we reduce the interval by a factor of $B$. This thus requires only $O(\log_B N) = O(\log N / \log B)$ page accesses. In reality of course, we have to store pointers and possibly other metadata in each node, so we can’t have exactly $B$ elements in each node, but we can definitely split by $\Theta(B)$ each level.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-cache-oblivious-algorithm-van-emde-boas-layout">Efficient cache-oblivious algorithm: van Emde Boas layout</h2>
<p>Now we come to the exciting part. We claim that we can achieve $O(\log_B N)$ page accesses, but without having to know $B$ ahead of time. The data structure we’re using is a good old balanced Binary Search Tree. However, the order in which we store the nodes in memory matters. If we pack the the BST in a regular fashion, say in breadth-first order, we could potentially have a situation where almost every vertex in a BST search path, except for the first few, lies in a different page, and thus we’ll have to use $O(\log N - \log B)$ page accesses. The van Embde Boas layout is basically a clever way of ordering the vertices of a binary search tree in a recursive, fractal-like manner such that each page access will fetch the next few vertices that will be queried, so that the next few accesses will be contained within that page.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For convenience, suppose the binary tree is complete and has height $H=2^K$. The layout is a permutation of the vertices of the binary tree. Denote $T(x, k)$ as the subtree of height $2^k$, rooted at vertex $x$. If the subtree at $x$ is deeper than $2^k$, then $T(x,k)$ will be the subtree truncated to the required depth. Denote $L(x, k)$ as the layout for that subtree. Then, for some root vertex $x$, of a (sub-)tree with height $h=2^k$, $L(x, k)$ is defined recursively as:</p>
<p>$$L(x, k) = L(x, k-1) \circ L(l_1, k-1) \circ L(l_2, k-1) \circ \dots \circ L(l_{n}, k-1)$$</p>
<p>Where, $l_1, \dots, l_{n}$ are the $n=2^{h/2}$ children of the leaves of $T(x, k-1)$, and $\circ$ is just concatenation. One application of this recursion is shown above.</p>
<h3 id="visual-sketch">Visual sketch</h3>
<p>If you didn’t catch that, don’t worry about it. Here’s a walkthrough. Suppose we’re given a complete binary tree of height $h=2^k$, rooted at $x$. We want to compute $L(x, k)$, which is a permutation of the vertices in this binary tree. Here’s how it’s done:</p>

<p>The aim of this project was to display a colour image on a black and white monitor, by overlaying an acetate bayer filter over the monitor and mosaicing a colour image.</p>



<p>I obtained an Eizo B&amp;W monitor from ebay, which I was intending for use viewing B&amp;W photos and was curious if I could replicate an effect similar to <strong>Autochrome Lumière</strong> ( see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochrome_Lumi%C3%A8re">wikipedia</a> ) where they overlay colour filters over a B&amp;W photographic plate, using starch grains, which creates a colour image.</p>



<p>The following image shows a 500x microscope image of the pixels that make up the B&amp;W LCD display, taken using a very cheap USB microscope.  It looks to me as if each pixel, is represented by 4 sub-pixel elements, please correct me if this appears not be the case.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007.jpg 640w, https://www.anfractuosity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mpv-shot0007-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>A pdf was created of the bayer display, with the dimensions 433.1mm x 324.8mm.  The monitor has a resolution of 2048×1536 and I assumed the pixels had the same width as height.</p>



<p>You can see an example of the pdf I created below, where for example a blue element, should be represented by 2×2 pixels from the B&amp;W monitor. </p>

<p>I created 3 pdfs:</p>



<ul><li>bayer_1.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 1 pixel from the display</li><li>bayer_2.pdf  –  each element, is represented by 2×2 pixels from the display (this is the acetate used in the video)</li><li>bayer_4.pdf – each element is represented by 4×4 pixels from the display</li></ul>



<p>The following image shows the printed acetate with the bayer pattern:</p>

<h2>Image of effect</h2>



<p>As you can see the effect of my attempt is quite slight, but you can see in the centre the different colours of the balloons.</p>

<p>The effect is also demonstrated in the following video, with the following parameters:</p>

<h2>Possible improvements</h2>



<p>I wonder if by measuring the exact pixel width/height under a microscope, if the effect could possibly be improved somewhat, as that information could be used when creating the acetate filter.</p>



<p>Alignment is also a key issue, I need to think of ways to improve that possibly using a microscope while aligning the acetate.</p>



<p>I’d be interested in other improvements I could make too!</p>



<h2>Source</h2>



<p>The sourcecode to generate the PDFs for the acetate and the mosaiced images and videos is at:</p>

                <p>Last year as I kicked off my career entering the professional tech world, I came across the concept of <strong>Objective, Key and Results (OKRs)</strong> at work. I was quite intrigued by the whole concept of OKRs.</p>

<p>In very layman terms —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Main objective of OKR is to plan out qualitative goals with quantitative results for those with proper time tracking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People do use diary or todo apps for tracking there work. Todo apps usually work for tracking tasks over a shorter duration. You need a framework to plan out for your bigger goal and track your progress towards it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bX5Vy1OPJ3LImq9DHIgU5g.png" alt="Personal OKR Header Section"></p>

<p>In this blog, I will try to explain how you can plan and why it is important to have your Personal OKR. Let’s begin!</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>OKRs is already a very popular term in business, most probably it is being used at your workplace too. It is a <strong>goal-setting framework</strong> that basically covers big and challenging goals with a set of defined measurable results for achieving these goals.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective — </h3>

<ul>
  <li>What do you want to achieve over a period of time?</li>
  <li>Objectives should be ambitious, more <strong>inspirational</strong> (which requires more effort of yours), bold and <strong>qualitative</strong></li>
  <li>Your targets should not be something very easily achievable.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Improve the financial condition, Get better at reading, etc</p>

<h3 id="key-results">Key Results</h3>

<ul>
  <li>KRs are steps you need to achieve the objective.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Quantitative</strong> i.e having defined metrics! This should not be vague. Add numbers, avoid terms like “more/less”.<br>
Google uses. a scale of 0–1 for tracking progress for each key result.</li>
  <li>Make KRs <strong>Time-bounded</strong>. This helps you tracking progress over the period and lets you recalibrate your tasks.</li>
  <li>KRs should be <strong>Binary</strong> i.e Complete / Incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eg.</strong> Read 3 books on investing, Read 1500 pages monthly, etc</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="personal-vs-work-okrs">Personal vs Work OKRs?</h3>

<p>OKRs are used by both teams and individuals, though mostly in work environments. The concept of OKR is simple and works pretty effectively for personal use as well. It is super important to have separate personal and work OKRs since your work goals are different from personal life and goals.</p>

<p>In personal OKRs, you would want to track things like —</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family time</li>
  <li>Personal finance</li>
  <li>Fitness</li>
  <li>Hobbies</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal OKRs are <strong>literally personal</strong>!<br>
It varies from person to person. It’s good to look for ideas on how people use OKRs, but you should align it for your goals and aspirations which you want to achieve.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actions — and data — speak louder than words.”<br>
― <strong>John Doerr,</strong> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/54960827"><strong>Measure What Matters</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>OKRs help you plan your goals in a structured and planned fashion, but there is more to it! Let me explain —</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better <strong>Focus</strong> and <strong>Alignment</strong> on what you want to achieve. Since OKRs are limited, you don’t want to waste time and do stuff that doesn’t really help you achieve what you want!</li>
  <li>These give the <strong>Motivation</strong> to work towards your objectives and a sense of urgency to finish them.</li>
  <li>OKRs help in building a <strong>Habit</strong> of planning things in general and following the path to achieving them. Eg. You have an objective of getting better at reading, you start reading 30 pages daily. Now, it slowly builds into your habit to read. Next year, even if you don’t have this objective, you’ll still read :)</li>
  <li><strong>Time Tracking</strong> is super useful and important since they give a timeline for you to work and align your tasks accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> and Numbers help you visualize your progress. When you see 80% completion, you get a psychological motivation to make it 100%</li>
  <li>If you have a <strong>Public OKR</strong>, you get another source to actually work and complete your task.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘I’d rather have the objective be to go to Mars, and if we fall short, we’ll get to the moon. This is how you make moonshots. — Larry Page</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/benefits-of-okrs/">Measure what matters</a> brings a similar <strong>F.A.C.T.S</strong> showing the benefits of OKRs.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>Now, that you understand the importance of Personal OKRs and are ready to create yours, I’ll show how I personally maintain my OKRs and share resources that might be useful for you!</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to start creating an OKR. I personally being a big fan of <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, use it to maintain my Personal OKRs. You can use anything from professional notes and trackers like <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> to simple excel sheet template.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*IOarq_FgPMWWVqohXAMvHg.png" alt="OKR Tracking with Notes"></p>

<p>I usually update my OKRs monthly since I maintain a yearly OKR tracker. You can adjust it according to the timeline you are planning for.</p>

<p>I maintain different tables for each of my Objectives. In the image below</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> — Boost Knowledge</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong> —</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read 20 books</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create 2 open source projects</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Time Tracking</strong> — <br>
I maintain time tracking based on which quarter of the year I want this to be completed. I do break these KRs into sub-tasks which are added to my Todolist with a specified timeline.<br>
I use <strong>EOY</strong> (End of Year) in cases when I want that KR to be worked on throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Status</strong>—</p>

<p>I set my KRs progress to one of the 5 stages. It helps me keep track of what to do next and what is already completed. I sometimes add <strong>At-Risk</strong> tag to denote that this KR is probably not happening. I already added <strong>At-Risk</strong> to my traveling KRs this year credits to corona :(</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HQJ56kvlk0-mDZiXBrptfw.png" alt="Quarter based timeframe and Status for tracking progress"></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>  — <br>
These are basically notes/links relevant to KR which I would want to revisit when I come back to this sometime later.</p>

<h2 id="tips-and-tricks">Tips and Tricks</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Avoid changing OKRs</strong>! It is okay to update OKRs when you achieve something or want to divert. Do not remove OKRs just because you are doing something else now, at the end of the timeframe you should know that you failed at this due to XYZ reason, and was it worth it or not?</li>
  <li>You will fail in many Key results! <strong>It is okay to fail</strong>, now you get an idea on what did you miss, how can you improve and rework accordingly.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly update your KRs status and notes</strong>, this gives you an idea of where you need to focus more in the next few days. A biweekly or monthly review is generally a good time to revisit OKRs. I set up a biweekly reminder in my calendar for this!</li>
  <li>You can <strong>add a score</strong> to each KR to make things more interesting. For the first time, I wanted to keep it simple. Do share if you use some interesting scoring :P</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid setting too many OKRs</strong> instead make the OKRs more challenging.</li>
  <li>Add links to your weekly tasks in notes sections. This helps you view how did you spend your week in the perspective of achieving your OKR results. Even add resources for specific KRs. This helps you increase your knowledge base over a period of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it simple</strong>! Follow what you can maintain. Don’t overcomplicate :)</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These are some of the common myths about Patents and Trademarks in startups.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have a startup idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>It’s natural to feel defensive about our <a href="https://hitstartup.com/startup-ideas-vs-problems/" target="_blank">startup idea</a>, but patents are for invention/innovation and not for a startup idea; even if we get nightmares about <a href="https://hitstartup.com/faang-will-steal-my-idea/" target="_blank">FAANG stealing our startup idea</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-an-innovative-app-idea-i-need-to-protect-it-with-a-patent">I have an innovative app idea, I need to protect it with a patent</h3><p>Most countries don’t allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200213051434/https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/software_patents_fulltext.html" target="_blank">patent for a software</a>. Economic theories, methods of doing business, mathematical methods or computer programs&nbsp;as such&nbsp;are not patentable inventions in several countries.</p><h3 id="my-patent-attorney-said-they-are-patentable">My patent attorney said they are patentable</h3><p>Did you read all the clauses in the agreement you signed with your patent attorney? The decision to award a patent to an invention/innovation lies solely with the patent examiner of the country. By the time a patent application is filed, till it comes to examination, several years and thousands of dollars would have been spent.</p><p>Although ethically, a patent attorney should explicitly convey their doubts on patentability of an invention, few rarely do. Even when Prior Art Search(Searching for conflicting patents) is conducted by the patent attorney, they are not always successful in bringing up the conflicting patents because our patent application is not drafted yet.</p><p>But, when the Govt. patent examiner does the Prior Art Search while examining our patent application, they will likely find conflicting patents if it exists.</p><h3 id="i-have-paid-my-patent-attorney-explained-my-invention-now-all-i-have-to-do-is-just-sit-tight-for-a-patent">I have paid my patent attorney, explained my invention, now all I have to do is just sit tight for a patent</h3><p>An average patent attorney drafts patent for anything from innovation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet" target="_blank">bidet</a> to quantum computers, so they are experts in using language to define an invention but they are rarely an expert in any field of invention.</p><p>So, this requires utmost care from the inventor to work along with the patent drafter to articulate their invention with appropriate vocabulary.</p><p>Unfortunately, patent attorneys tend to force the inventor to not to be specific in describing their invention in the patent application in order to exploit the loop holes in patent examination; This may help in getting the patent, but it also enables someone else to exploit the same loop holes to file a patent for the copy of our invention by just changing the grammar/vocabulary because our patent was too generic.</p><h3 id="i-have-filed-for-a-patent-no-one-would-copy-my-innovation-invention">I have filed for a patent, no one would copy my innovation/invention</h3><p>Examination of patent takes several years, although in the meantime we could use ‘patent-pending’ tag if our patent application gets published, finding someone who is copying our invention takes proactive approach. If the copied invention is being applied for patent, we need to detect it from published journal of the patent office and raise a concern.</p><p>All these takes extraordinarily focused effort and budget.</p><h3 id="i-have-applied-for-a-patent-via-pct-i-will-receive-patent-for-all-countries">I have applied for a patent via PCT, I will receive patent for all countries</h3><p><a href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/" target="_blank">PCT - Patent Cooperation Treaty</a> simplifies the process of applying for a patent in several countries who are part of the PCT treaty, but the process of obtaining a patent depends upon the individual country’s patent laws.</p><p>Even during filing PCT, the second phase i.e. national phase involves filing documents for patent application in the respective individual countries requiring working with the patent attorney’s of those countries resulting in thousands of dollars of expense for each country we wish to apply for via PCT.</p><p>We can extrapolate the same process for patent examination in each of those countries.</p><p>Then there are certain countries which even while being part of the PCT, doesn’t enforce patent protection for inventions of other countries in order to protect their local businesses which copies our invention.</p><h3 id="i-have-received-my-patent-it-would-prevent-someone-from-copying-my-invention">I have received my patent, it would prevent someone from copying my invention</h3><p>Like any law, existence of a law doesn’t prevent someone from violating it; enforcement and judicial process should uphold that law. Similarly, existence of patent doesn’t prevent someone from copying our invention.</p><p>We need to find the violator, pursue an often lengthy and expensive judicial process to claim our right to the invention protected by the patent.</p><h3 id="i-m-the-inventor-in-the-patent-i-can-do-anything-with-it">I’m the inventor in the patent, I can do anything with it</h3><p>Unless the inventor in the patent is the owner of the patent, the inventor has no right to the patent. This is often the case when businesses file patents, where the business is the owner in the patent and the employee is the inventor in the patent.</p><h3 id="patents-are-only-for-protecting-my-invention">Patents are only for protecting my invention</h3><p>The main reason to protect the invention is to reap the value of the invention if needed. Patents offer commercial and strategic value to businesses.</p><p>So, patents are often used for trading them for money or for other patents in organizations apart from using it for protecting their inventions.</p><h3 id="patents-make-me-look-cool">Patents make me look cool</h3><p>Not necessarily, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/new-low-bad-patent-patent-troll-sues-ventilator-company" target="_blank">patent trolls</a> have left a bad taste in the inventor/innovator community; so much so that many are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIihrcqJYA" target="_blank">choosing not to file patent for their invention</a>.</p><p>Expenses, effort, lengthy unfair judicial trials has made several startups to not pursue patent for their invention in favor of capital efficiency.</p><h3 id="open-source-projects-doesn-t-need-patents">Open-source projects doesn’t need patents</h3><p>Open-source projects might need patents to <a href="https://golang.org/PATENTS" target="_blank">protect itself from getting sued for patent infringement</a>. Open-source projects protected by patents can prevent large organizations from stealing our project <a href="https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/" target="_blank">without due credit</a>.</p><h3 id="i-have-a-startup-product-name-i-need-to-trademark-it">I have a startup/product name, I need to trademark it</h3><p>Unless the startup/product has created value for its customers, so that a counterfeiter is using that startup/product name for forgery; trademarks for startup/product names are useless. Besides, in most countries just <a href="https://hitstartup.com/when-to-register-our-startup/" target="_blank">incorporating/registering our startup as a company</a> would prevent anyone else from using the same name for their company.</p><h3 id="trademark-automatically-applies-to-the-name-and-the-logo">Trademark automatically applies to the name and the logo</h3><p>Trademarking the name and logo are separate process namely wordmark and device mark respectively.

  <p><time datetime="2020-06-09T09:45:00-0400">Tue, Jun 9, 2020</time></p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/posts/hp712-nextstep-part-1">last post of this series</a>, I set up NeXTstep on an HP PA-RISC <a href="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/pizzaboxes/hp712">workstation</a>. Today, I’m going to get down to business: configure networking, install system patches, outfit it with developer tools, and install some useful software!</p>
<p>As with the previous post, I’ve also made a YouTube video that covers roughly the same topics! If video is your speed, I’d love for you to check it out!</p>
<p>

</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My goal is to end up with a capable machine that I can use like it might have been when new, and learn from the experience.</p>
<h2 id="foreshadowing-networking-woes">Foreshadowing networking woes</h2>
<p>While it is possible to transfer files from SCSI drives (or even floppies!), <strong>getting a pizzabox on my home network makes loading software much easier</strong>.
I first tried out NeXTstep on this workstation a couple years ago. The OS installed OK, but I ran in to trouble with networking. I was initially optimistic that I would figure it out:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think I'm done for the day but soon if I can fight with NFS and NetInfo (lolololol) I can get screenshots off it and software on</p>— cron mom (@sophaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/sophaskins/status/962427825608429568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2018</a></blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>NARRATOR</strong>: she did not soon win the fight with NFS and NetInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second: NeXTstep is a workstation-focused Unix operating system from the 80s-90s - <strong>how could it be difficult to get it on a network</strong>? The answer is a thing called NetInfo.</p>
<p>In a surprise to exactly no one, NeXTstep, being from a company founded by Steve Jobs, had it’s own NeXT-only ecosystem of tools that fit together amazingly well. <strong>The cornerstone of NeXTstep networking was NetInfo</strong>. If you had a collection of NeXT computers on a network, NetInfo gave you a system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage user accounts that would work across all machines</li>
<li>configure file sharing</li>
<li>control permissions around access to network resources</li>
<li>assign IP addresses and hostnames</li>
<li>quickly bring new machines in to the network</li>
<li>serve this information in a highly-available manner</li>
</ul>
<p>which is to say: NetInfo is a “directory services” system. That’s all well and good - in the early 1990s that space had many competitors and a “right path” hadn’t yet been established, but…<strong>I don’t <em>want</em> my machine to be part of a directory</strong>, **I just want it to be on my existing TCP/IP network.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-simple-network">Starting a “simple” network</h2>
<p>With that in mind, I (naively) attempted to use the “SimpleNetworkStarter” application.</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

  </figure>
</div>

<p>The SimpleNetworkStarter window has three “steps”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>how we’ll integrate</strong> with an existing NetInfo network (since I don’t intend to interact with one at all, I have to choose “Provide the services specified below”, a sort of catch-all)</li>
<li>Specify <strong>my hostname and IP address</strong> - if I were connecting to an existing NetInfo network, I might not have to do this. “Network Options” lets me set more granular IP settings like netmask and gateway; “NetInfo Options” lets me choose how to integrate with existing domains (if relevant).</li>
<li>Setup <strong>network services</strong>: for my setup I don’t really want <em>any</em> of these things, but as a standalone NeXTstep system, I do have to “Maintain the master copy of network administrative data” (aka, the NetInfo database).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far, this feels like a really good start, but will it let me fetch files from an NFS share?</p>
<h2 id="networking-woes">Networking woes</h2>
<p>I immediately tried connecting to my NAS over NFS - after all, the main point of setting up networking was making it easier to transfer files. Unfortunately, it didn’t work - I could set up the NFS mount with NFSMananger (more on how to do that later), but the mountpoint would always be empty. Here you can see me attempting to reach it by IP address:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/failing-nfs-mount.png" alt="a failing NFS mount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>a failing NFS mount</p>

  </figure>
</div>

<p>So I had <em>some</em> sort of problem. To narrow down potential issues, I ran a few tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>attempting to ping my NAS</strong> from the workstation - this turned out to not work because NeXTstep doesn’t seem to have any <code>ping</code> command. There are probably ways to accomplish something equivalent with the tools it <em>does</em> have, but I just moved on</li>
<li><strong>attempting to ping the workstation</strong> from elsewhere on my network. This worked - I was able to ping it from my laptop!</li>
<li><strong>attempting to connect to my NAS with FTP</strong> - one of the few network tools NeXTstep <em>does</em> seem to have is FTP, so I gave it a shot. To my surprise, this works!</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-ip.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully)">

</div>

<p>It did not work via hostname, though, which points to at least some trouble with DNS. Taking a deeper look at the “NeXTstep 3.3 Network and
System Administration Manual” section on “<a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Docs/NeXTStep/3.3/nsa/11_MixedNet.htmld/index.html">NEXTSTEP Computers in a Mixed Network</a>” (which I probably should have done earlier) shows that <strong>I need to manually configure DNS</strong>. There’s no GUI options for it, you just have to write out an <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

<p>After rebooting, I was able to access the NAS via FTP by hostname:


</p><div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/ftp-by-hostname.png" alt="connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname">

      <figcaption>
          <p>connecting to my NAS via FTP (successfully) by hostname</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>But still couldn’t use NFS. What gives? I have network connectivity in both directions, and DNS is also now working! I believe this is as far as I got a few years ago, and man I was FRUSTRATED.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought to look in the system log (<code>/usr/adm/messages</code>) for hints:</p>


<div>
  <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.pizzabox.computer/img/hp712/nextstep-part-2/dmesg.png" alt="an error from autonfsmount">

      <figcaption>
          <p>an error from autonfsmount</p>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>and there it was:</p>
<pre><code>autonfsmount: Can't get my address
</code></pre><p>Can’t get…<em>my</em> address? Doesn’t the computer know its own address? While I don’t know <em>why</em> it has to do this (googling has provided me a couple of <a href="https://rute.gerdesas.com/node31.html">quick asides</a> mentioning it, but not much detail), <strong>mounting an NFS server requires working <em>reverse</em> DNS for your IP</strong>.</p>
<p>I do have a real-ish DNS server for my home network, and it populates based on DHCP leases and IP reservations. This workstation, though, was just <strong>using an IP that I habitually hardcode for pizzaboxes (192.168.1.200)</strong>. I double-checked the DHCP server config, and it was indeed set up with a different host for that IP, and not set up at all for this hostname. I replaced that entry with one for <code>hp712</code> at <code>192.168.1.200</code> for the MAC address of my workstation, and crossed my fingers.</p>
<p>It worked! I could browse my NAS from the file-browser.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-an-nfs-mount">Setting up an NFS mount</h2>
<p>After all that rigamarole, the right way to configure a remote NFS mount goes through the NFSManager.app. While NFSManager lets you configure both “exports” (local directories I share with others) and “imports” (remote directories I want to mount locally).</p>

<p>That’s it? A lot of struggle got me to this point, but <em>finally</em> I can transfer files.</p>
<h2 id="patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to <strong>run system updates</strong>. NeXTstep 3.3 was released in mid-1995, and it had three patch updates: the <a href="https://www.nextop.de/NeXTAnswers/2066.html">first</a> at the end of 1995, and the second and <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/nextstep3.3_patch_3_overview.pdf">third</a> in late 1999. Since NeXT were acquired by Apple in 1997, this patch was made by Apple to address Y2k bugs and other longstanding issues. Thanks, Apple! <a href="https://youtu.be/gaI6kBVyu00?t=28"><em>Thapple</em></a>.</p>
<p>The third patch is a cumulative update, so that should be all I need. Nextcomputers.org generously <a href="http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Patches/NEXTSTEP_3.3_User_Patch_3/">hosts</a> the patch for download. Because I’m using an HP PA-RISC machine, I need <code>NS33RISCUserPatch3.tar</code>. System updates need to be installed as the <code>root</code> user, and if you run them as <code>me</code> (the default user) NeXTstep doesn’t prompt to escalate privilges, it just gives an error. Thus, I need to log in as <code>root</code> directly. In order to do that, I need to give the <code>me</code> user a password so the system will stop automatically logging in at boot (giving me a chance to log in as <code>root</code>). To set a password, you go to Preferences.app and navigate to the lock icon.</p>

<p>By default, the <code>root</code> password is blank (you can of course fix this after login in the same way as setting a password for the <code>me</code> account). I navigated to where I had put the patch tarball on my NAS, copied it to the HP 712, and unarchived it.</p>

<p>After a reboot, I’m on the most recent version of NeXTstep for PA-RISC, and ready for the year 2000!</p>

<p>What’s next for making a usable system? Developer tools! <strong>NeXTstep came on two sets of discs - “User” for the main operating system, and the optional “Developer” disc</strong> with compilers, GUI building tools, libraries, and documentation. While there were separate versions of NeXTstep User for CISC (m68k and i386) and RISC (PA-RISC and SPARC) platforms, the Developer disc is “quad-fat” - it contains binaries for all four platforms.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>With Apple’s recent announcement that they are moving away from Intel X86 CPU’s to their own ARM CPU’s for future laptops and desktops I thought it would be a good time to take a look at the some differences that can affect systems programmers working in Rust.</p>

<p>One of the key areas where ARM CPU’s differ from X86 is their memory model. This article will take a look at what a memory model is and how it can cause code to be correct on one CPU but cause race conditions on another.</p>

<h2 id="memory-models">Memory Models</h2>

<p>The way loads and stores to memory interact between multiple threads on a specific CPU is called that architecture’s Memory Model.</p>

<p>Depending on the memory model of the CPU, multiple writes by one thread may become visible to another thread in a different order to the one they were issued in.</p>

<p>The same is true of a thread issuing multiple reads. A thread issuing multiple reads may receive “snapshots” of global state that represent points in time ordered differently to the order of issue.</p>

<p>Modern hardware needs this flexibility to be able to maximize the throughput of memory operations. While CPU clock rates and core counts have been increasing with each new CPU iteration, memory bandwidth has struggled to keep up. Moving data from memory to operate on is often the bottle neck in the performance of applications.</p>

<p>If you’ve never written multi-threaded code, or only done so using higher level synchronization primitives such as <code>std::sync::Mutex</code>, you’ve probably never been exposed to the details of the memory model. This is because the CPU, despite whatever reordering it’s memory model allows it to perform, always presents a consistent view of memory to the current thread.</p>

<p>If we look at the below snippet of code that writes to memory and then reads the same memory straight back, we will always get the expected value of <code>58</code> back when we read. There is never the case that we’d read some stale value from memory.</p>

<p><em>I’m using volatile operations because if I used normal pointer operations the compiler is smart enough to skip the memory read and just prints the value <code>58</code>. 
Volatile operations stop the compiler from reordering or skipping our memory operation. However they have no affect on hardware (or the compiler re-ordering relative to non-volatile memory operations).</em></p>

<p>Once we introduce multiple threads, we’re now exposed to the fact that the CPU may be reordering our memory operations.</p>

<p>We can examine the snippet below in a multi-threaded context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>58</span><span>);</span>
    <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.write_volatile</span><span>(</span><span>42</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>(</span><span>u32_ptr_1</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>(),</span> <span>u32_ptr_2</span><span>.read_volatile</span><span>())</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we initialize the contents of both pointers to <code>0</code>, and then run each function in a different thread, we can list the possible outcomes for the reader. We know that there is no synchronization, but based on our experience with single threaded code we think the possible return values are <code>(0, 0)</code>, <code>(58, 0)</code> or <code>(58, 42)</code>. But the possibility of hardware reordering of memory writes affecting multi-threads means that there is a fourth option <code>(0, 42)</code>.</p>

<p>You might think there are more possibilities due to the lack of synchronization. But all hardware memory models guarantee that aligned loads and store up to the native word size are atomic (u32 or a 32-bit CPU, u64 on a 64-bit CPU). If we changed one of our writes to <code>0xFFFF_FFFF</code>, the read will only ever see the old value or the new value. It will never see a partial value like <code>0xFFFF_0000</code>.</p>

<p>If the details of the CPU’s memory model are hidden away when using regular memory accesses, it seems like we would have no way to control it in multi-threaded programs where it affects program correctness.</p>

<p>Luckily Rust provides as with the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module containing types that gives us the control we need. We use these types to specify exactly the memory ordering requirements our code needs. We trade performance for correctness. We place restrictions on what order the hardware can perform memory operations, taking away any bandwidth optimizations the hardware would want to perform.</p>

<p>When working with the <code>atomic</code> module, we don’t worry about the actual memory models of individual CPU architectures. Instead the operation of the <code>atomic</code> module works on an abstract memory model that’s CPU agnostic. Once we’ve expressed our requirements on the loads and stores using this Rust memory model, the compiler does the job of mapping to the memory model of the target CPU.</p>

<p>The requirements we specify on each operation takes the form of what reordering we want to allow (or deny) on the operation. The orderings form a hierarchy, with each level placing more restrictions the CPU. For example <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> means the CPU is free to perform any reordering it wants. <code>Ordering::Release</code> means that a store can only complete after all proceeding stores have finished.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how atomic memory writes are actually compiled, compared to a regular write.</p>

<p>If we look at the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/uVQM8T">X86 assembly</a> for the above code, we see the first three functions produce identical code. It’s not until the stricter <code>SeqCst</code> ordering that we get a different instruction being produced.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>

        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>58</span>
        <span>ret</span>

        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The first two orderings use the <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> (<strong>MOV</strong>e) instruction to write the value to memory. Only the strictest ordering produces a different instruction, <strong><code>XCHG</code></strong> (atomic e<strong>XCH</strong>an<strong>G</strong>), to a raw pointer write.</p>

<p>We can compare that to the <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/wWQo8P">ARM assembly</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_write:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>str</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>

<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_release:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
        
<span>example:</span><span>:</span><span>test_atomic_consistent:</span>
        <span>mov</span>     <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>#</span><span>58</span>
        <span>stlr</span>    <span>w8</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>x0</span><span>]</span>
        <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In contrast we can see there is a difference once we hit the release ordering requirement. The raw pointer and relaxed atomic store use <strong><code>STR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>egister) while the release and sequential ordering uses the instruction <strong><code>STLR</code></strong> (<strong>ST</strong>ore with re<strong>L</strong>ease <strong>R</strong>egister). <em>The <strong><code>MOV</code></strong> instruction in this disassembly is moving the constant <code>58</code> into a register, it’s not a memory operation.</em></p>

<p>We should be able to see the risk here. The mapping between the theoretical Rust memory model and the X86 memory model is more forgiving to programmer error. It’s possible for us to write code that is wrong with respect to the abstract memory model, but still have it produce the correct assembly code and work correctly on some CPU’s.</p>

<h2 id="writing-a-multi-threaded-program-using-atomic-operations">Writing a Multi-Threaded Program using Atomic Operations</h2>

<p>The program we’ll be exploring builds upon the concept of storing a pointer value being atomic across threads. One thread is going to perform some work using a mutable object it owns. Once it’s finished that work it’s going to publish that work as an immutable shared reference, using an atomic pointer write to both signal the work is complete and allow reading threads to use the data.</p>

<h2 id="the-x86-only-implementation">The X86 Only Implementation</h2>

<p>If we really want to test how forgiving the X86’s memory model is, we can write multi-threaded code that skips any use of the <code>std::sync::atomic</code> module. I want to stress this is not something you should ever actually consider doing. In fact this code has undefined behavior due to not guarding against possible compiler instruction re-ordering (however in Rust 1.44.1 the compiler doesn’t re-order so the code “works”). This is an learning exercise only.</p>

Their offer? A system with familiarities appreciated by developers and online services welcomed by users.</p><p>Please note that, due to consistency with other sources, this article separates storage units between the metric prefix (i.e. megabytes or ‘MB’) and the standardised binary prefix (i.e. mebibytes or ‘MiB’), thus:</p><ul><li>1 MB = 1000 KB</li><li>1 MiB = 1024 KiB</li></ul><p>… and so forth.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>The processor included in this console is a slightly customised version of the famous <strong>Intel Pentium III</strong> (an off-the-shelf CPU for computers) running at <strong>733 MHz</strong>. With this, one can assume this console is just a PC behind the scenes… I won’t tell you the answer, but I promise that at the end of the article you will be able to reach your own conclusion.</p><p>Anyhow, Pentiums, along with other lines of CPUs designed and manufactured by Intel, were incredibly popular in the computer market. Such was Intel’s market share that they became the de-facto reference point for quality: As a typical user, if you wanted a good computer and had the budget, you only had to look for <em>something</em> carrying an Intel CPU. We all know by now that there are more factors involved, but that’s what the marketing guys at Intel managed to project.</p><h4 id="technical-information">Technical information</h4><p>Now that we positioned Intel in the map, let’s go back to the topic of this console. During my research, I was expecting to find documentation with the level of depth as other CPUs (MIPS, SuperH, ARM, etc), but instead, I stumbled across an excessive amount of marketing terms that only diverted my search. So, for this article, I came up with a structure to organise all the necessary information which will help to understand how this CPU works. Furthermore, I will try to introduce some terminology that Intel used to brand this CPU.</p><p>Having said that, let us take a look:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-branding-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-branding">Branding</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-the-isa-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-the-isa">The ISA</a></li><li id="tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture-link"><a href="#tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture">The Microarchitecture</a></li><li id="tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc-link"><a href="#tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc">CISC or RISC</a></li><li id="tab-1-5-the-core-link"><a href="#tab-1-5-the-core">The Core</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-branding"><h4>Branding</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/branding.113be6f183d200764d7cfc590548c60fe637af1411fccff6cb274c99c9a5fa28.png"><picture>

So what does this mean? Back then (early 00s), the Pentium series represented the next-generation of CPUs. They were ‘new high-end’ that grouped all the fancy technology that made computers super-fast, plus it helped buyers decide which CPU they had to buy if they wanted <em>the best of the best</em>.</p><p>The Pentium III replaced Pentium II, which in turn replaced the original Pentium. Moreover, when the first Pentium came out, it replaced the 80486, which in turn replaced the 80386… You get the idea. What matters is that ‘Pentium’ is mainly a brand name, it’s not directly associated with its inner workings. Therefore, we must go deeper!</p><p>To dive further and not get lost in the way, I have catalogued the information into three sections which combined, make up the chip. The first the <strong>Instruction Set Architecture</strong> or ‘ISA’ (the group of instructions used to command the CPU), <strong>Microarchitecture</strong> (how is the ISA implemented in silicon) and the <strong>Core</strong> (what set of components are used to package the microarchitecture to form the specific CPU model).</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-the-isa"><h4>The ISA</h4><p>Indeed, after I mentioned the name Intel it was a matter of time before I introduce the famous <strong>x86</strong>, its instruction set.</p><p>Even though x86 first appeared with the release of the 16-bit CPU called <strong>Intel 8086</strong> in 1978, the ISA has been constantly expanded with more instructions as more Intel CPUs were released (80186, 80286 and so on). Consequently, x86 started to fragment as more ground-breaking features were added (i.e. ‘real mode’, vs ‘protected mode’ vs ‘long mode’). To tackle this, modern x86 applications commonly targeted the 80386 ISA (also referred as <strong>IA-32</strong> or <strong>i386</strong>) as a baseline, which among other things, operates in a 32-bit environment.</p><p>Subsequently, Intel presented enhancements of IA-32 in the form of <strong>extensions</strong>, meaning these may or may not be included in an IA-32 CPU. Programs can query the CPU to check if a specific enhancement is present. The Xbox’s CPU includes two extensions:</p><ul><li><strong>MMX</strong> (Multimedia Extension): Adds 57 SIMD instructions and 8 64-bit registers (integers only) that can speed up vector operations.</li><li><strong>SSE</strong> (Streaming SIMD extension): Another SIMD-type extension which addresses some of the limitations of MMX (lack of floating-point support and unable to use floating-point unit in parallel). It adds 8 128-bit registers (called ‘XMM’) that hold four 32-bit floats; and 56 new instructions.</li></ul><p>Good news is that since the console will always have the same CPU features, programmers can optimise their code to exploit these extensions as they will always be present.</p></div><div id="tab-1-3-the-microarchitecture"><h4>The Microarchitecture</h4><p>When it comes to building a circuit that can interpret x86 instructions, Intel has come up with so many different designs for their CPUs. Some designs were featured with the release of a new Pentium Series (i.e. Pentium 4) while others are featured when Intel releases an ‘enhanced’ version of a Pentium (such as the ‘Pentium Pro’). Nevertheless, since the release of the first Pentium, the microarchitecture is identified with a different name from the CPU model. For example, the original Pentium includes the ‘P5’ microarchitecture.</p><p>Now, the Xbox CPU, along with the rest of Pentium III processors, use the <strong>P6 Microarchitecture</strong> (also known as ‘i686’). This is the 6th generation (counting from the 8086) which features:</p><ul><li>A <em>massive</em> <strong>14-stage pipeline</strong>.</li><li><strong>Out-of-order execution</strong>: If possible, the CPU re-orders the sequence of instructions to increase efficiency and performance.</li><li><strong>Speculative prediction</strong>: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#features">branch prediction</a>, but it also executes the branch that the CPU has predicted it will be chosen.</li></ul><p>Having said that, take a closer look at these features. It so happens they are very similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#features">previous consoles</a>, however, the other CPUs are very different in terms of design compared to Intel ones. Historically, one could argue that Intel could have never been able to accomplish, let’s say, a pipelined CPU. Yet they managed to do so, so let us see why…</p></div><div id="tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc"><h4>CISC or RISC</h4><p>All of the competitor’s consoles previously analysed contain a <strong>RISC</strong> CPU whereas Intel’s x86 ones are <strong>CISC</strong>. RISC CPUs are known for having a simplified instruction set compared to CISC CPUs. This includes, for instance, not featuring instructions that operate values directly from memory (as opposed to registers).</p><p>One of the advantages of RISC processors is that their simplistic approach enables its CPUs to be designed with a modular sense, which in turn can be exploited to improve performance with parallelism techniques. This is why we have seen CPUs like MIPS and PowerPC debuting pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order, branch prediction, etc. On the other side, ‘CISC’ processors were design many years before the RISC processors appeared and aimed to solve different needs. Consequently, their designs are not as flexible as RISC ones.</p><p>Back to the original question, the P6 is an interesting design, because while the CPU only understands a CISC instruction set (x86), it interprets the ISA using <strong>microcode</strong> (called ‘micro-operations’) and the unit that executes that code is built around the guidelines of RISC. All in all, this allows Intel to apply the optimisations of RISC processors while keeping a ‘CISC layer’ for compatibility with x86.</p><p>Microcode is already embedded in the silicon but it can be patched, allowing Intel to fix its CPUs after production whenever a bug or a security vulnerability is discovered. If you have read previous articles (i.e. N64 or PS2), bear in mind that Intel’s microcode is <strong>not publicly accessible</strong> (let alone documented) and Intel is its solely ‘maintainer’.</p></div><div id="tab-1-5-the-core"><h4>The Core</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/core.63696b1d55e579495cbbb6e42a5ee66fe0ce7fee34e107f74c750a34546c309a.png"><picture>

Specifically, the Xbox includes one model called <strong>Coppermine</strong>. This was also released as the second revision of the Pentium III (replacing the ‘Katmai’ core) and includes the following components:</p><ul><li><strong>32 KiB L1</strong> cache: Divided between 16 KiB for instructions and 16 KiB for data.</li><li>Integrated <strong>128 KiB L2</strong> cache: This is <em>odd</em> since the off-the-shelf Coppermine has 256 KiB of L2. In fact, the Coppermine128 (found in the Intel ‘Celeron’ brand, the low-end Pentium alternative) has the same amount of L2. This is probably done to reduce manufacturing costs, and keep this console at a competitive price.</li><li>133 MHz <strong>Front-side bus</strong>: This is the bus that connects the L2 cache with the memory controller, we’ll see more about it later on.<ul><li>Intel names it ‘Front-side bus’ to distinguish it from another bus which connects the L2 (external cache) with the L1 (internal cache). The latter bus is called ‘Back-side bus’ and yes… It’s an unfortunate name to use from the UK.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Coppermine also features two ‘enhancements’ over their original implementation of L2 cache, these are the <strong>Advanced Transfer Cache</strong> and the <strong>Advanced System Buffering</strong>. To sum them up, L2 cache is on-chip and their buses are wider, which help to reduce possible bottlenecks found in the Front-side bus.</p><p>Finally, the chip uses the ‘Micro-PGA2’ socket to connect it to the motherboard, but like any other console, the Xbox has it soldered with a Ball Grid Array or ‘BGA’.</p></div></div></div><h4 id="p6-and-the-end-of-pentium-numbers">P6 and the end of Pentium numbers</h4><p>Here’s a bit more history: After the years of the P6, Intel planned to succeed it with the ‘Netburst’ microarchitecture (featured in the Pentium IV). However, the line of succession also ended there: The microarchitecture couldn’t be improved anymore. This prompted an Intel team in Israel to revisit the old P6 and develop a more efficient successor. The result was <strong>Pentium M</strong>, eventually extended to form the <strong>Core</strong> microarchitecture (and brand). ‘Core’ is the basis of present designs.</p><h4 id="motherboard-architecture">Motherboard architecture</h4><p>At some point in the history of the PC, motherboards grew so much in complexity that new designs had to be developed from the ground up to efficiently tackle new emerging needs.</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/xbox/cpu/motherboard.8ddd164202ef59296b376029d383dac1a91e08eea715a6596e1eefe61af1a160.png"><picture>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Lessons learned building a profitable algorithmic trading system using Reinforcement Learning techniques.</p><div id="post-content"><p>About two years ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/">little piece</a> about applying Reinforcement Learning to the markets. A few people asked me what became of it. So this post covers some high-level things I've learned. It's more of a rant than an organized post, really. If there is enough interest in this topic I'd be happy to go into more technical detail in future posts, but that's TBD. Please let me know in the comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/dennybritz">Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Over the past few years I've built four and a half trading systems. The first one was crap. The second one I never finished because I realized early on that it could never work either. The third one was abandoned for personal and political reasons. The fourth one worked extremely well for 12-18 months, producing something on the order of a full-time salary with a tiny investment of a few thousands dollars. Then, profits started decreasing and I decided to move on to other things. I lacked the motivation to build yet another system. Some of the systems I worked on were for the financial markets, but the last one was applied to the crypto markets. So keep that in mind while reading.</p>  <p>If you've taken some economics classes your first thought is perhaps something like</p> <blockquote> <p>Ha, Efficient Market Hypothesis! You can't beat the market! It's all just luck!</p> </blockquote> <p>And I would say that most economic theories like the EMH are quite far removed from the real world. This doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. They are interesting academic models that can be useful in certain contexts, like for writing papers or getting prizes. But they don't survive confrontations with a messy real world and emotional human beings. I won't get into it here because you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM9bYOBuKF4">smarter people</a> arguing about this, but even the original author admits that the EMH is just a theoretical model. Suffice to say, I believe (and have seen myself) that you can build profitable systems that consistently beat the market. Will the market eventually adjust and take away that opportunity? Probably, but that's irrelevant, because the market may take months, years or decades to adjust (just look at HFT), and you are free to evolve your system over time, looking for new opportunities and adjusting to the adjusting market yourself. That was the case for me. The market may have adjusted to my system as profits started decreasing, but it took more than 12 months, and with the right motivation I probably could have adjusted and improved the system to work again.</p> <p>Rather than thinking about markets from an economics perspective, I prefer to think about them from a Game Theory or Reinforcement Learning perspective. <strong><strong>The market does not exist.</strong></strong> What people call the market is an emergent property of many agents acting in an environment trying to maximize their own objective. The objective may be slightly different for everyone. Some want to sell shares they obtained through a stock options plan at a good price. Some engage in arbitrage for quick profits. Some try to predict short-term movements based on news or charting patterns. Some engage long-term speculation based on fundamentals. Some are designated market makers providing liquidity for a specific asset or exchange in return for a fee. Each could be a human acting on gut feeling and emotion, a human following some kind of implicit fuzzy algorithm (e.g. charting), or an automated system acting on data. The combined behavior of all these agents gives rise to this illusive thing that people call <em>the market</em>. Your goal isn't to beat the market, it's to beat some of the other players in the market over a time horizon you care about. The time horizon part is important. Not every trade has a clear winner and loser, because agents are optimizing over different time horizons, ranging from microseconds to decades.</p>  <p>If you come from a tech or startup background, transitioning to trading may require a change in thinking. Products and engineering are often about <strong><strong>absolutes</strong></strong>. If your website takes 100ms to load that's pretty good. Making it load in 99ms provides negligible benefit to the end-user. It'd be a waste of engineering resources. The same is true for startups. Paul Graham likes to say that startups are rarely killed by competitors. Rather, they commit suicide. They fail because they cannot find customers, don't have a solid business model, or because of founder issues. Being killed by competition with a slightly better product is quite rare.</p> <p>Trading is different. It's about <strong><strong>relatives</strong></strong>. It's fine if your website takes a horrible 10 seconds to load if your competitor needs 11 seconds. Having crappy data is fine if everyone else's data is even crappier. Paying high trading fees is fine if everyone is paying the same. This is pretty obvious if you look at the market as a multiplayer game. Even if you're a bad player on an absolute scale, you can win if your competition is worse. This has direct effects on how you build software to trade in the markets.</p>  <p>What a focus on relative performance means for engineering can be quite counterintuitive.</p> <p>When building infrastructure for a product-based company you would prefer using battle-tested, robust frameworks that minimize risk. Why re-invent the wheel if someone else has already built it? It's safe to use something that has been adopted by thousands of people. This is where open source shines. Using AWS for hosting your server? Postgres for storing your data? JSON for serialization? Python or Node for data collection? An open source library for calling APIs? Download Keras and train a NN on your data? Reasonable ideas, but when you are building trading infrastructure, you should think twice about these.</p> <p>Widely adopted technologies are commodities. If you use the same technologies as everyone else, where will your advantage come from? When building a product this doesn't matter because it's about absolute SLAs. But trading is about relatives. <strong><strong>Each commoditized technology you can specialize and build yourself is an opportunity</strong></strong> to beat the competition. By being hybrid cloud you can reduce latencies. By storing data in an efficient binary format you can save serialization time, leading to faster iteration during development, and faster predictions in production. By creating custom integrations with exchanges instead of using off-the-shelf APIs you may be able to use specific order types that are not available to others, or gain an informational advantage by processing exchange-specific information. And so on. Building highly-specialized non-generic systems is what engineers hate. We love generalization and abstraction. But specialization is often where your advantage in trading comes from.</p> <p>You don't need to start from scratch and implement your own programming language to start trading. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs you are making when adopting commoditized technologies. Make conscious decisions about it. Some of the things above seem minor - but a large number of tiny advantages can add up to a significant edge.</p>  <p>You may say, well, this makes sense, but I really don't want to compete on the infrastructure side. Instead, I want to build a smarter model that makes better predictions. That's my edge! I've heard this a LOT, and I've never seen it work.</p> <p>AI is pretty commoditized. I would say it's more commoditized than excellent infrastructure engineering, data collection, or inductive biases from domain knowledge. These days, you can easily download state-of-the-art models and run them on your data. Unless you are at the forefront of some extremely relevant research, it's unlikely that you can gain a significant edge just from training a better model.</p> <p>When people realize that their fancy AI model built on crappy infrastructure trained with crappy data (that's also used by everyone else) doesn't work, they give up. AI can give you an edge, but not an edge so huge that it allows you to ignore other factors. You still need to build good infrastructure, get good data, have decent latencies, and so on. Few people seem to be willing to spend time on these unsexy things. Think of each as a multiplier. If one is close to zero, it doesn't matter how good your AI model is.</p> <p>So, what are some these other things?</p> <ul> <li><strong><strong>Market</strong></strong> - Pick the right market(s) to trade in. Don't go for the obvious choices that everyone is picking by default. The harder it is to get access to a market, both legally and technically, the more likely that you will find opportunities. Less liquid markets may be overlooked by sophisticated funds because they don't scale to their AUM. Again, this is often counterintuitive to engineers who go for "good APIs" - good APIs typically mean popular. Popular typically means commoditized.</li> <li><strong><strong>Data</strong></strong> - Think about data sources that others do not have access to, or are not willing to get. For example, there may be data that's difficult to crawl due to sophisticated rate restrictions IP bans. Most people will give up here. This is an opportunity for you. Be skeptical of popular APIs and open source software. It's the same data that everyone else uses.</li> <li><strong><strong>Latencies</strong></strong> - You're probably not planning to compete with HFT traders (bad idea), but that doesn't mean you can completely ignore latencies. Better latencies will probably lead to easier execution with less slippage. Be careful about where you host your systems, how you send data around, how you serialize data, and so on.</li> <li><strong><strong>Models</strong></strong> - In general, better data is more important than better models, but better models can also give you an edge. Note that you are often trading off model complexity with latencies.</li> <li><strong><strong>Execution</strong></strong> - A good model doesn't mean much if you can't execute. Historical data you collect may look quite different from what's actually happening on the exchange. You are not going to know until you start live trading.</li> </ul>  <p>More than two years after my <a href="http://www.wildml.com/2018/02/introduction-to-learning-to-trade-with-reinforcement-learning/">last post</a>, do I still believe that Reinforcement Learning is the right approach to trading in the …</p></div></div>

June 26, 2020 | https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/guide/index.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/guide/index.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
        
        
        <p>Natively Cloud Native</p>
        <p><strong>Version:</strong> </p>
    </div>
    





<p>Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language.</p>
<p>Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.</p>
<p>Micronaut aims to provide all the tools necessary to build JVM applications including:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With Micronaut you can build Message-Driven Applications, Command Line Applications, HTTP Servers and more whilst for Microservices in particular Micronaut also provides:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed Configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Discovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP Routing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client-Side Load Balancing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>At the same time Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast startup time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced memory footprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal use of reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal use of proxies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No runtime bytecode generation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy Unit Testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Historically, frameworks such as Spring and Grails were not designed to run in scenarios such as server-less functions, Android apps, or low memory-footprint microservices. In contrast, Micronaut is designed to be suitable for all of these scenarios.</p>
<p>This goal is achieved through the use of Java’s <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html">annotation processors</a>, which are usable on any JVM language that supports them, as well as an HTTP Server and Client built on <a href="https://netty.io/">Netty</a>. In order to provide a similar programming model to Spring and Grails, these annotation processors precompile the necessary metadata in order to perform DI, define AOP proxies and configure your application to run in a low-memory environment.</p>
<p>Many of the APIs within Micronaut are heavily inspired by Spring and Grails. This is by design, and aids in bringing developers up to speed quickly.</p>

<h2 id="whatsNew"><a href="#whatsNew"></a>1.1 What's New?</h2>




<p>Micronaut 2.0.0 includes the following changes:</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_core_features">Core Features</h3>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_jdk_14">Support for JDK 14</h4>
<p>Micronaut has been updated to support JDK 14.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_groovy_3">Groovy 3</h4>
<p>Micronaut now supports applications written in Groovy 3.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_startup_performance_improvements">Startup Performance Improvements</h4>
<p>Startup time has been further improved in this release with typical startup time for a new application around 20% faster.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_improvements_to_bean_introspections">Improvements to Bean Introspections</h4>
<p>Bean introspections have been improved to support static creator methods, interfaces and enums. This means you can define a bean introspection on an interface with a private implementation such as:</p>
<div>
<p>Introspections on interfaces</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">import io.micronaut.core.annotation.Creator;

@io.micronaut.core.annotation.Introspected
interface Example {
    String getName();

    @Creator
    static Example create(String name) {
        return () -&gt; name;
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_analyzing_the_injection_point">Support for Analyzing the Injection Point</h4>
<p>Micronaut’s Dependency Injection implementation has been improved such that you can now receive an <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/inject/InjectionPoint.html">InjectionPoint</a> instance to any <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html">@Factory</a> method. This makes it possible to customize how the bean is created based on the annotation metadata at the point at which the bean is injected.</p>
<p>For example consider the following definition:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Inject @Client("http://foo.com") RxHttpClient client;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A factory method can receive the injection point and create a client based off of the value:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">@Bean
protected DefaultHttpClient httpClient(InjectionPoint&lt;?&gt; injectionPoint) {
    String url = metadata.stringValue(Client.class).orElse(null);
    if (url != null) {
        return new DefaultHttpClient(url);
    } else {
        return new DefaultHttpClient();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_support_for_eager_initialization_of_beans">Support for Eager Initialization of Beans</h4>
<p>Eager initialization of beans is useful in certain cases, such as on AWS Lambda where more CPU resources are assigned to Lamdba construction than execution. Therefore as for Micronaut 2.0, you can specify whether you want to eager initialization configuration or all singletons using the <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/ApplicationContextBuilder.html">ApplicationContextBuilder</a> interface:</p>
<div>
<p>Enabling Eager Initialization</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Micronaut.build(args)
            .eagerInitSingletons(true) <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
            .mainClass(Application.class)
            .start();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Setting eager init to true initializes all singletons</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to just eager init configuration using <code>eagerInitConfiguration</code> which will initialize all <a href="https://docs.micronaut.io/2.0.0/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/ConfigurationProperties.html">@ConfigurationProperties</a> beans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_spot_bugs_instead_of_jsr_305_nullable_nonnull_annotations">Spot Bugs Instead of JSR-305 Nullable/NonNull Annotations</h4>
<p>In Micronaut 1.x the Google distributed JSR-305 annotations library (<code>com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305</code>) was used to specify <code>@Nullable</code> and <code>@NonNull</code> on interfaces of the Micronaut API using the annotations contained within the <code>javax.annotation</code> package.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that JSR-305 has been cancelled and that this dependency has potential licensing issues (by using the <code>javax</code> namespace) as well as problems with the cross packages on Java 9+ with the module system Micronaut 2.x switches to the <code>spotbugs-annotations</code> module provided by the <a href="https://spotbugs.github.io/">SpotBugs project</a>.</p>
<p>It is recommended users of Micronaut use this API instead (although the <code>javax.annotation.Nullable</code> and <code>javax.annotation.NotNull</code> annotations continue to be supported).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_cli_features">CLI Features</h3>

<div>
<h4 id="_micronaut_launch">Micronaut Launch</h4>
<p>Create Micronaut 2.0 applications without having the CLI installed using <code>curl</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="bash">$ curl https://launch.micronaut.io/demo.zip -o demo.zip
$ unzip demo.zip -d demo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>


</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_diff_command">Diff Command</h4>
<p>Run <code>mn feature-diff --features=[FEATURE NAME]</code> from the root of another Micronaut project to create a diff of the changes that need to be applied to enable the feature. For example:</p>
<div>
<p>Using <code>feature-diff</code></p>
<div>

June 26, 2020 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/hardcoded-secrets-unverified-tokens-and-other-common-jwt-mistakes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/hardcoded-secrets-unverified-tokens-and-other-common-jwt-mistakes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 7519)</a> that defines a way to provide information within a JSON object between two parties. This standard is intended to help transmit information securely, but no standard or technology will protect you when used improperly.</p>
<p>To identify what can go wrong when using JWT in Node.js, I performed a security review on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm</a> modules that use the most popular JWT libraries. Using static analysis tooling, I examined 2,000 npm modules for security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This post summarizes some common mistakes that were found during my research, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded secrets</li>
<li>Allowing the <code>none</code> algorithm for signing</li>
<li>Missing or incorrect token validation</li>
<li>Sensitive data exposure</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to describing these issues so you can avoid them, this post includes open source rules that make it easier to either manually audit your code bases to detect them, or include in CI so these vulnerabilities never get merged into your code in the first place.</p>
<h2>Hardcoded secrets</h2>
<p>The most basic mistake is using hardcoded secrets for JWT generation/verification. This allows an attacker to forge the token if the source code (and JWT secret in it) is publicly exposed or leaked.</p>
<p>Not only does this introduce a vulnerability, it’s also considered a software anti-pattern. You should keep your JWT secrets apart from your code, for example, in separate configuration files or environment variables.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> secret <span>=</span> <span>"hardcoded-secret-here"</span><span>;</span> 

<span>class</span> <span>JwtAuthentication</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(</span>obj<span>,</span> secret<span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a popular way to use JWTs is within other libraries, e.g., through <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-jwt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passport</a>, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>var</span> JwtStrategy <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'passport-jwt'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>Strategy<span>,</span>
    ExtractJwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'passport-jwt'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>ExtractJwt<span>;</span>

<span>var</span> opts <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    secretOrKey<span>:</span><span>'hardcoded-secret-here'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span>

passport<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>JwtStrategy</span><span>(</span>opts<span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>jwt_payload<span>,</span> done</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though this is a known and quite obvious issue, it’s still common to use hardcoded secrets while developing and then accidentally leave it in your codebase. Fortunately, it’s also very easy to find hardcoded secrets with SAST tools, especially with <a href="https://semgrep.live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep</a>, which helps to find complex code patterns with rules that are very simple to write.
Rules for detecting hardcoded secrets:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-hardcode</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.passport-jwt.security.passport-hardcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.passport-jwt.security.passport-hardcode</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.express.security.express-jwt-hardcoded-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.express.security.express-jwt-hardcoded-secret</a></p>
<h2>Allowing 'none' algorithm for signing</h2>
<p>Allowing tokens to have the 'none' algorithm was <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/#Meet-the%E2%80%94None%E2%80%94Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a critical vulnerability</a> some years ago. Nowadays, most popular JWT libraries do not allow decoding or verifying tokens with the None algorithm without explicitly enabling it. The same as with hardcoded secrets, it’s easy to leave ‘'none'` in your codebase after testing or debugging.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> secret <span>=</span> <span>"some-secret"</span><span>;</span>
jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span><span>"token-here"</span><span>,</span> secret<span>,</span> <span>{</span> algorithms<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"RS256"</span><span>,</span> <span>"none"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, if you forget to remove it after messing with code, it’s also very easy to catch it with Semgrep.
Rules for detecting ‘none’ algorithm allowed in your code:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-none-alg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-none-alg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-none-alg</a></p>
<h2>Not verifying tokens the right way</h2>
<p>Sometimes developers rely on their methods of token verification instead of using built-in API, or omit verification completely.
Small wonder that usually it introduces the opportunity for attackers to forge information inside the token.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>checkToken</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>token<span>,</span> refreshToken<span>,</span> key</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>refreshToken<span>,</span> key<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>token<span>)</span><span>.</span>param <span>===</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>refreshToken<span>)</span><span>.</span>param<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note: only <code>refreshToken</code> is verified in the example above, which gives an opportunity to attacker to manipulate function results. By changing value of <code>param</code> property stored inside <code>token</code> an attacker can force the result of <code>checkToken</code> function to be <code>true</code> and pass the verification.</p>
<p>On top of that, it’s very typical to get certain data from tokens before verifying it (issue date, id, etc.) and then use it as a verification context. Usually it’s harmless, but only if this data does not go any further. If the information from an unverified token is passed to other parts of the code it may introduce a vulnerability.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> jwt <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"jsonwebtoken"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>function</span> <span>checkToken</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> issuer <span>=</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span>token<span>)</span><span>.</span>issuer<span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>findIssuer</span><span>(</span>issuer<span>)</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>verify</span><span>(</span>token<span>,</span> key<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"not valid token"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>function</span> <span>findIssuer</span><span>(</span><span>iss</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  database<span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span>iss<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(In the example above, the unverified <code>issuer</code> value is passed to another function before validating the token (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection</a>). If not used carefully it may end up in different kinds of injection vulnerabilities, especially if located in separate parts of the codebase.)</p>
<p>Also do not forget that even if a token is verified properly, the data stored in it should be treated as user input and be validated and sanitized according to the context.</p>
<p>Rule that helps identify lack of token verification:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-decode-without-verify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-decode-without-verify</a></p>
<h2>Sensitive data exposure</h2>
<p>When an object is converted to a JWT token without explicitly breaking it down into parts, it’s very easy to lose control of what is inside the object and disclose some sensitive information.</p>
<p>This is a very widespread mistake while using ORM libraries like Mongoose, Sequelize, etc. ORM models do not include any sensitive data at the moment of creation, but when the situation changes it is very easy to forget that the ORM object is also passed to JWT token.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> mongoose <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'mongoose'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
Schema <span>=</span> mongoose<span>.</span>Schema<span>;</span>

<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Schema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    password<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
    admin<span>:</span> Boolean
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> User <span>=</span> mongoose<span>.</span><span>model</span><span>(</span><span>'LocalUser'</span><span>,</span> schema<span>)</span><span>;</span>


router<span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>'/signin'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req<span>,</span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

User<span>.</span><span>findOne</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>name<span>:</span> req<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>name<span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>err<span>,</span> user</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> token <span>=</span> jwt<span>.</span><span>sign</span><span>(</span>user<span>,</span> key<span>,</span> <span>{</span>expiresIn<span>:</span> <span>60</span><span>*</span><span>60</span><span>*</span><span>10</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    res<span>.</span><span>json</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
        success<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
        message<span>:</span> <span>'Enjoy your token!'</span><span>,</span>
        token<span>:</span> token
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Needless to say, you should not keep sensitive data in JWT token intentionally.</p>
<p>Helpful Semgrep rules:</p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-exposed-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.audit.jwt-exposed-data</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-exposed-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jose.security.jwt-exposed-credentials</a></p>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-exposed-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://semgrep.live/editor?registry=javascript.jsonwebtoken.security.jwt-exposed-credentials</a></p>
<p>These are the most common mistakes developers make when using JWT in their Node.js projects. Stay secure and don’t forget to automate security scans in your codebase.</p>

I would be lucky if I got a hit and got 1,000 plays on one of my songs.

It sucks for the artist and it sucks for the bloggers. Spotify deserves a lot of credit for here. </p><h3>3. Songs Matter, Not Albums</h3><p>Spotify's algorithmic playlists rank songs— not albums. It's just like in SEO: Google indexes pages, not websites. </p><p>This has elevated the importance of songs and made albums more irrelevant than ever— especially for small artists like me. (Of course famous artists like Drake and Billie Eilish can still get massive press from an album release— but most artists are not at that level of fame.)</p><p>These days it’s almost always better to release individual songs rather than albums.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-22e1940a7b25c119a57a"><div><p>I get why the growing irrelevance of albums bums some people out. Albums are big statements. Some of the most iconic releases in popular music have been albums. </p><p>… But things change and that’s okay. Plus I think asking listeners to listen to a full-length album don’t make sense in our attention-starved world. Asking listeners to listen to a single song might just be a more realistic ask. </p><h3>4. Human Editors Still Matter— Just Not How You Think</h3><p>The secret to getting your music on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly is to get on <em>human</em> playlists first. </p><p>It’s similar to SEO: playlists are like backlinks. When a song is added to a playlist it's a vote for the quality of the song. Not every playlist is equally authoritative though— just like how a link from The NY Times is more authoritative than other links in SEO.  </p><p>On Spotify, the most authoritative playlists are <em>editorial</em> playlists. These are  playlists curated by official Spotify editors. <strong>In my experience, it’s only when I get on an editorial playlist that my songs get heavily featured on algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly.</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-d2618bdb9eb6fca6fb0b"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-811f68956e11c14d5a36"><div><p>So how do you get on editorial playlists? I sincerely have no clue. I've been on editorial playlists 16 times but I have no idea how to replicate that.  </p><p><em>Note: In my experience, major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists. This is discouraging— if major label artists have an easier time getting on editorial playlists, they’ll also get better placement in algorithmic playlists… But major label artists also only typically get 13% - 20% of streaming royalties… so there are still plenty of reasons to stay indie! </em></p><h3>5. Algorithms Make For Looser Relationships Between Artists And Listeners</h3><blockquote><p><em>"Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity." - David Bowie</em></p></blockquote><p>My most popular song 'Circles' has been played 1,350,00 times. And every month about 65,000 people listen to my music on Spotify. </p><p>Guess how many people follow me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stevebenjamins/">on Instagram</a>? 480. </p><p>Just because people listen to me on Spotify, doesn’t mean they want a deep relationship. Most listeners just add 'Circles' to their library and move on with their life.</p><p>I’m definitely okay with this. I’d rather listeners follow me on Spotify rather than Instagram anyways. Plus only good things can come out of de-coupling fame from music. Make music because it’s what you love to do— not because you want to get famous. If you want to get famous I think you’re better off as a Youtuber or Tiktok influencer anyways! </p><p><strong>I think this is just the nature of algorithmic playlists— they lead to a high volume of listeners with a very loose connection to you as an artist:</strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-a901b06fafc5a15411fa"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-a93c404fd14f000ea4f9"><div><h3>6. The Deepest Relationships Happen When Listeners Share Music With Friends</h3><p>Listeners sharing music among their friends leads to the deepest connections in my experience. </p><p>For example: last month I was interviewed on a college radio station by three guys. I was blown away by how closely these guys  listened to the music. They knew it so well and had spotted lyrical themes that I’ve repeated throughout songs that I thought I only noticed. It was clear there was a very deep connection.  </p><p>Hearing from listeners like that is nourishing in a way that a graph on Spotify just can't be.  It can be a very moving experience.</p><p>I’ve had similar experiences when high school students reach out to tell me everyone in their circle is listening to the music. Somehow they seem to just care about the music more— like their shared interest draws them deeper. </p><p>When you spend most of your time in an algorithmic world of music streaming, it can feel like magic when you meet listeners who found your music through friends. Sharing music between friends can’t much algorithms in sheer volume but it is by far the deepest way to build connections. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-9ce321c7732a79bf3e5a"><div>

<p>In April/May of 2010, I spent four weeks as a freelance writer for The Onion News Network.</p>
<p>Besides looking great on a resume, it was an awesome gig and a huge learning experience. Not surprisingly, I get asked about it pretty often.</p>
<p>So here's everything I know about how to get a job writing for <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a>, and what I learned from my (short) time doing it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="howigotajobfreelancewritingfortheonion">How I Got a Job Freelance Writing for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>Getting a job writing for The Onion is not easy. But there's no big secret to it, either.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/jobs">The Onion has a jobs page</a> on their website.</p>
<p>Yep. That's the big story behind how I got hired to write for The Onion: I went on their website and applied.</p>
<p>But here's the thing -- I did this at least twice with no luck before I got accepted.</p>
<p>Here's how it worked back then:</p>
<p>I would check the job listings frequently (obsessively), and every once in a blue moon, there'd be a position on there called Freelancer or Freelance Writer. You'd send in an email with your resume and samples, and they'd send back an application for you to complete. You had to return two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A list of 20 headlines</strong> and concepts for video sketches. (All the job listings I ever saw were for The Onion News Network -- their video leg. I never saw anything for editorial positions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A completed script</strong> for one of their news segment sketches based on ideas or concepts they provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Like I said, I went through this process (the final product is often known in the industry as a "packet") at least twice with no success. It doesn't sound like much, but it is TOUGH. I labored over those 20 headlines like you wouldn't believe. Even the best ideas start to look like shit after you've stared at them for a week.</p>
<p>And the scripts. Man, those were hard. They never gave you blockbuster concepts to work with, and I think that was on purpose. It was always some kind of dry, subtle joke -- they wanted to see what you could do and how far you would take it.</p>
<p>But the third time I applied was a charm. I'll never forget opening my email and seeing these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Onion News Network would like to congratulate you on being selected as a Contributor for the IFC series. We had a huge number of applicants, and we are thrilled with how strong this group is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember texting my wife -- girlfriend at the time. She was in class and stepped into the hall to call me. We both basically screamed on the phone for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Side Note:</strong> I haven't seen any writing positions listed on The Onion's website in years. Granted, I don't check as frequently anymore, but I think the only way to get in with them these days is to be recruited, know someone there, or come up through the ranks as an intern or writer's assistant.</p>
<p>If you REALLY want to get a job writing for The Onion; email them. I've heard stories of people that have done this. They say they won't take anything unsolicited, and there's a 99% chance they won't, but who knows? Serendipity just might strike for you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatitwasliketowritefortheonion">What It Was Like to Write for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>They put us to work right away. This was back in 2010, and The Onion was going into pre-production on its very first TV show -- The Onion News Network on IFC (The Independent Film Channel).</p>
<p>It would be a lot like the Onion video content we knew and loved, except in a half hour format and with recurring anchors as characters.</p>
<p>We were required to turn in 25 ideas a week; an "idea" being a headline or concept along with a short explanation of the joke and how the segment would play out.</p>
<p>Some weeks, we'd get really brief feedback on our lists. Other weeks, not. Then, by mid week, they'd compile all the ideas they liked. Some would be marked down as "one liners", or jokes that would be pulled in to scroll across the bottom of the screen during the show. Others were segmented by where in the show they might fit in, with some of them designated to move to the scripting stage (where the staff writers would take over).</p>
<p>The process moved fast. My job, along with the other freelancers, was to come up with ideas. We weren't really consulted or informed about anything else surrounding the show. No meetings to discuss casting. No phone calls to brainstorm around our jokes. It was our job to pump out creativity and let the full time staff filter everything out. Everything was done over email.</p>
<p>In the end, only one of my ideas actually made it into the show -- unless I missed a one-liner somewhere along the line, which would be easy to do.</p>
<p>Funny enough, the idea of mine that made it to production was one from my submission packet -- I'm pretty sure it's the reason they hired me. And they actually chose to open the entire series with it, which was pretty cool.</p>

<p>I recorded the pilot when it aired and probably watched it a dozen times with my family. One of the coolest moments I've ever had as a writer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="whatilearnedwritingfortheonion">What I Learned Writing for The Onion</h2>
<hr>
<p>This was a huge learning experience for me in a very short amount of time. I could probably talk for days about everything I learned working as a writer for The Onion for four weeks, but if I had to boil it down, here's what I'd say:</p>
<h3 id="ideasarecheap">Ideas are cheap.</h3>
<p>Or, in their case, jokes. They made us come up with so many sketch ideas and headlines. Huge lists of them. And once they were dead, they were dead. There was no reusing ideas that didn't quite make the cut in previous weeks. No iterating on almost-there jokes. When an idea was rejected, it was time to move on. Always bigger and better jokes, or ideas, out there to be found.</p>
<p>I also learned how to really dig into an idea to see if it had any potential. They were constantly pushing us to see past the headline. Is it just a funny sentence or is there room to explore and expand this into a 3 minute sketch? Is there substance?</p>
<h3 id="creativityisamuscle">Creativity is a muscle.</h3>
<p>What I loved about The Onion's writing process was the sheer volume of it. 25 ideas a week. No excuses. Often times, I'd turn in more than 25, along with a big list of one-liners I knew weren't big enough for full sketches. For one thing, it forced me to dig deep and get past those first initial ideas that came easily. It also helped me learn The Onion's editorial voice through repetition, which is something that can't be overstated.</p>
<h3 id="iamnotthatfunny">I am not that funny.</h3>
<p>I had one great idea and I used it up in my application to get the job. I wrote a few other funny jokes throughout, but nowhere near the level of The Onion's top writers. I wish I could show you these lists of approved ideas I got in my inbox each week. Reading through them was an absolute blast; these guys and girls are so freaking talented and funny.</p>
<p>At the end of the project, they opted to keep a few of the freelance writers on -- alas, I was not one of them. And I didn't expect to be. To be a professional humor writer, you have to be insanely funny and creative. I'm a good writer, and I got their voice, and I have a few good ideas, but I was never going to make it as a full-time writer for The Onion. And that's okay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="intheend">In The End</h2>
<hr>
<p>Writing for The Onion was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had, and I feel lucky to have gotten the opportunity.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to see an idea I had sitting in my living room acted out on TV with a real script, real actors, and real production value. That was awesome, and I'll never forget it. And to top it off, I actually got a paycheck. People paid me real money to come up with jokes. That was incredible.</p>
<p>And I'd like to think that, even though the gig was short lived, I learned a ton by being bold enough to jump into the deep end with pro comedy writers.</p>
<p>Even if I didn't really belong there.</p>

Considering the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types">vast number of different databases</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/types/relational/comparing-sql-query-builders-and-orms">variety of tools</a> for working with them, this is an extremely ambitious goal!</p><p>We are thrilled to enter the next chapter of pursuing this goal with a <strong>$12M Series A</strong> funding round led by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://amplifypartners.com/">Amplify Partners</a>. We are especially excited about this partnership as Amplify is an experienced investor in the developer tooling ecosystem and has led investments for numerous companies, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gremlin.com/">Gremlin</a>.</p><hr><h3 id="our-mission-making-databases-easy"><a href="#our-mission-making-databases-easy" aria-label="our mission making databases easy permalink"></a>Our mission: Making databases easy</h3><h4 id="database-tools-are-stuck-with-legacy-paradigms"><a href="#database-tools-are-stuck-with-legacy-paradigms" aria-label="database tools are stuck with legacy paradigms permalink"></a>Database tools are stuck with legacy paradigms</h4><p>Despite having been developed in the 1970s, relational <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases">databases</a> are still the most commonly used databases today. While <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types">other database types have been developed in the meantime</a>, from <em>document</em>, to <em>graph</em> , to <em>key-value</em> databases, working with databases remains one of the biggest challenges in application development.</p><p>While almost any other part of the development stack has been modernized, database tools have been stuck with the same paradigms for the last decades.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/WwMdROo.png"></span></p><p>When working with relational databases, developers have the choice of working directly with SQL or using a higher-level abstraction called ORMs. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/why-prisma#problems-with-sql-orms-and-other-database-tools">None of these options is particularly compelling</a>.</p><p>Using SQL is very low-level resulting in reduced developer <em>productivity</em>. In contrast, ORMs are too high-level and developers sacrifice <em>control</em> over the executed database operations when using this approach. ORMs further suffer from a fundamentally misguided abstraction called the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">object-relational impedance mismatch</a>.</p><h4 id="prisma-modernizes-how-developers-work-with-databases"><a href="#prisma-modernizes-how-developers-work-with-databases" aria-label="prisma modernizes how developers work with databases permalink"></a>Prisma modernizes how developers work with databases</h4><p>Similar to how React.js modernized frontend development or how Serverless invented a new model for compute infrastructure, <strong>Prisma is here to bring a new and modern approach for working with databases</strong>!</p><p>Prisma's unique approach to solving database access with a <em>generated</em> query builder that's fully type-safe and can be tailored to any database schema sets it apart from previous attempts of solving the same problem.</p><p>A big part of the modernization comes from our <strong>major focus on developer experience</strong>. Database tools are often associated with friction, uncertainty, painful hours of debugging and costly performance bottlenecks.</p><div><p><strong>Developer experience is part of our DNA at Prisma.</strong> Working with databases is too often associated with friction and uncertainty when it should be fun, delightful and productive!</p></div><p>We want to make working with databases <em>fun</em>, <em>delightful</em> and <em>productive</em> while guiding developers towards proper patterns and best practices in their daily work with databases!</p><h4 id="learning-from-our-past-from-graphql-to-databases"><a href="#learning-from-our-past-from-graphql-to-databases" aria-label="learning from our past from graphql to databases permalink"></a>Learning from our past: From GraphQL to databases</h4><p>As a company we've gone through a number of major product iterations and pivots over the last years.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/4YPWyaW.png"></span></p><p>Our initial products, Graphcool and Prisma 1 were focused on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> as a technology. However, as we were running both tools in production, we realized they didn't address the <em>core</em> problems developers had.</p><p>We realized that a lot of the value we provided with both tools didn't necessarily lie in the quick provision of a GraphQL server, but rather in the fact that developers didn't need to manage their <em>database workflows</em> explicitly.</p><p>This realization led to a pivot which ultimately manifested in the rewrite to Prisma 2. With this new version of Prisma, we have found the right level of abstraction that ensures developers keep full control and flexibility about their development stack while not needing to worry about database workflows!</p><h4 id="inspired-by-the-data-layers-of-big-companies-twitter-facebook-"><a href="#inspired-by-the-data-layers-of-big-companies-twitter-facebook-" aria-label="inspired by the data layers of big companies twitter facebook  permalink"></a>Inspired by the data layers of big companies (Twitter, Facebook, ...)</h4><p>The approach Prisma takes for this modernization is inspired by big tech companies such as Twitter, Facebook, or Airbnb. </p><p>To ensure productivity of application developers, it is a common practice in these organizations to introduce a <em>unified data access layer</em> that abstracts away the database infrastructure and provides developers with a more familiar and convenient way of accessing data.</p><p>Facebook developed a system called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/tao-facebooks-distributed-database-for-social-graph-c2b45f5346ea">TAO</a> that fulfills the data needs of application developers. Twitter has built a "virtual database" called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/graphql/graphql-at-twitter#schema">Strato</a> which <em>brings together multiple data sources so that they can be queried and mutated uniformly</em>. Airbnb <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/reconciling-graphql-and-thrift-at-airbnb-a97e8d290712">combines GraphQL and Thrift</a> to abstract away the implementation details of querying data.</p><p><span><img src="https://imgur.com/Hb9VOWN.png"></span></p><p>Building these custom data access layers requires <em>a lot</em> of time and resources (as these are typically implemented by dedicated <em>infrastructure teams</em>) and thus is not a realistic approach for most companies and development teams.</p><p>Being based on the same core ideas and principles as these systems, <strong>Prisma democratizes the pattern of a uniform data access layer</strong> and makes it accessible as an open-source technology for development teams of all sizes.</p><hr><h3 id="where-we-are-today"><a href="#where-we-are-today" aria-label="where we are today permalink"></a>Where we are today</h3><h4 id="prisma-20-is-ready-for-production"><a href="#prisma-20-is-ready-for-production" aria-label="prisma 20 is ready for production permalink"></a>Prisma 2.0 is ready for production</h4><p>After running Preview and Beta versions for more than a year, we've recently <a href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-2-n0v98rzc8br1">launched Prisma 2.0 for production</a>. Having rewritten the core of Prisma from Scala to Rust for the transition, we've built a strong foundation to expand the Prisma toolkit to cover various database workflows in the future.</p><p>Prisma's main feature is <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client">Prisma Client</a>, an auto-generated and type-safe query builder which can be used to access a database in Node.js and TypeScript.

Especially with applications running in production, it is often unclear what the best approach is to perform schema changes (e.g. in CI/CD environments). Many developers resort to manual migrations or custom scripts, making the process brittle and error-prone.</p><p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate">Prisma Migrate</a> is our solution to this problem. Prisma Migrate lets developers map the declarative <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> to their database. Under the hood, Prisma Migrate generates the required SQL statements to perform the migration.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Prisma Migrate is currently in an experimental state and should not be used in production environments.</p></blockquote><h4 id="prisma-studio-a-visual-editor-for-your-database-workflows"><a href="#prisma-studio-a-visual-editor-for-your-database-workflows" aria-label="prisma studio a visual editor for your database workflows permalink"></a>Prisma Studio: A visual editor for your database workflows</h4><p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-studio">Prisma Studio</a> is your visual companion for various database workflows.

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Safe to say that the past couple months have gone a lot different than many of us were expecting. In early March, as quarantine was starting and all of my projection design gigs were being cancelled, I hit up a couple close friends about building a non-linear theatre experience entirely online. A lot of folks have been trying to perform plays on Zoom (and have found a lot of interesting and clever ways of working with that medium), but I felt like we could make something really unique if we built our own custom video conferencing app.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/initial-google-doc.png">
<strong>The Google Doc that started it all</strong></p>

<p>Crazy? It definitely would’ve been 10 years ago. But advances in the web platform (as well as the quality of cameras and hardware in mobile devices) took this down into the realm of “possible-if-slightly-quixotic”.</p>

<p>Three months later, we’ve done it: Shattered Space is a piece of interactive theatre about a binary star system whose twin stars (“The Mothers”) have disappeared. You and your fellow audience members are Star Jockeys, and have been conscripted to fly around in spaceships to get to know the denizens of the Matra System and see what you can do to help.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iifZPEHJM6c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Here’s a trailer if you want a better idea of what’s going on</strong></p>

<p>If you watched that trailer, you’ve probably figured out that this show involved 3D graphics (WebGL), videoconferencing (WebRTC) and perhaps also some music and audio processing (Web Audio). These were all technologies that I’d worked with on some level in the past, but this show required me to think about them completely differently. All because of the following central problem:</p>

<h2 id="other-peoples-computers">Other People’s Computers</h2>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGt8w9RbhvY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>This WebRTC-based monitoring system allowed the backstage band to see the stage in real time and take cues from actors. The onstage portal was rendered with WebGL. (<em>Welcome to Shakesville</em>, Baltimore Rock Opera Society 2019)</strong></p>

<p>I’ve used WebGL and WebRTC to build projection/video effects for a number of shows the past couple years, but in every case I was writing code that would only run on <strong>my</strong> computer. If I ran into a device-specific bug that affected my computer (or my iPhone, or my squad of Raspberry Pis) I had all the time and access I needed to either debug it or come up with a workaround. Not this time.</p>

<p>If someone pays us $15, receives the login link via email, tries to open it on a cheap 2014 laptop and it can’t load without crashing, that’s a refund. We weren’t just messing around with advanced web features, we needed to deploy them in the most battle-hardened and resilient way possible, while also capturing just enough data and logs to pinpoint who was having problems and ideally solve them before the show started.</p>

<p>This meant going beyond the kinds of code you see in introductory tutorials and really digging into how these APIs deal with memory management, how they respond to connection issues, how they can fail, and how to tweak things at runtime to ensure that framerates stay high and dropped packets are few. I learned a lot about productizing these features, and I’d like to share as much of that as I can, but first let’s talk basics.</p>

<h2 id="basic-platform-overview">Basic Platform Overview</h2>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/ship-in-flight.png">
<strong>A group of attendees interacting with a character in the show</strong></p>

<p>Attendees of Shattered Space are broken up into 6 groups of 5. Each group is assigned to a “ship” that flies around the system, and they interact with the characters in the show as a group. Attendees have the options to mute their microphone and turn off their camera if they wish (there is a text chat on the side they can use to communicate) although we encourage people to keep them on if they feel comfortable.</p>

<p>The Shattered Space platform consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ExpressJS service that keeps track of the overall state of the show.</li>
  <li>7 Janus WebRTC media servers. One for each ship and a extra for broadcasting a livestream of the ending scene.</li>
  <li>The Admin App, a React/Redux webapp that handles scheduling shows, keeping track of which actor is talking to which ship, and has real-time dashboards with logs of client-side errors and connectivity issues.</li>
  <li>The Actor App, a React/Redux webapp used by actors to interact with the audience via audio, video, text, and the giving/taking of items from a ship’s inventory.</li>
  <li>The Attendee App, a React/Redux webapp where attendees view the show and interact with the actors and each other via audio, video and text.</li>
  <li>The Host App, used by me to perform the motion-captured ending scene.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I say that the Show Service “keeps track of the overall state of the show”, I mean <em>all</em> of the state. Most of the Redux actions (across all 3 apps) don’t mutate the state of the reducers, but instead hit an endpoint on the Show Service that changes the state kept in the database, then fetches <em>all</em> of the state from the database and sends it to <em>all</em> of the users as a WebSocket message which then overwrites most of the reducers’ state. This way, no client can end up with “orphan state” as a result of optimistically updating their reducer before their API call returns, and fetching the updated state for <em>all</em> users can be done with a single database call (this refresh-all-state-for-everyone method is debounced and implements a queueing mechanism to ensure we don’t have too many database calls at once).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/redux-oops.jpg">
<strong>I basically took Dan Abramov’s simple and elegant system and did this to it. <br> Sorry Dan.</strong></p>

<p>(I’d note that this architecture emerged sort of organicly and there are probably cleaner or more optimal ways of achieving this “Redux-but-the-server-is-the-reducer” architecture. I’m open to feedback on whether something like Relay or Meteor would be a better fit for a V2)</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/admin-show-online.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-screen.png">
<strong>The Admin app allows us to see who’s logged on and what’s happening in the show</strong></p>

<p>Of the 3 React/Redux apps, the Admin App uses the least of these shiny web technologies, and is pretty much just a dashboard for displaying what’s in the database. As admins, we can see which actors and attendees have logged on, which ships are currently visiting which actors, we can move attendees between ships if need be, and we can see a list of errors the actors and attendees have encountered (more on this later).</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/actor-app-normal.png">
<strong>The actor app allows performers to engage with the audience and view information about the ship they’re talking to</strong></p>

<p>The Actor App is more sophisticated, since it needs to handle WebRTC and media device concerns. It also has 3 modes: Normal, Mobile (used automatically if the window has a dimension less than 500px) and Headless (used if the querystring variable <code>headless</code> is set to <code>true</code>. The Normal mode is used by about half of the actors, and has the ability for them to see themselves, configure their audio/video devices, change any info about their user, character or planet, and view information about the ships they’re talking to (their chat, inventory, history of previous places, etc.).</p>

<strong>The mobile and headless modes of the actor app give our actors flexibility to use whatever devices they have available</strong></p>

<p>The Mobile mode uses a tab-based layout to try and accomplish all the same goals, but since only one tab can be on the screen at a time, it’s a bit of a pain to use on its own. We’ve got Headless mode, which doesn’t do any of the audio/video streaming, but shows all the information about the current ship and can run on any laptop. Many actors have opted for using the Mobile mode (since their phone has a good camera) but keeping Headless mode open on an old laptop to make it easier to use the other features.</p>

<strong>A group of attendees interacting with a character in the show</strong></p>

<p>The Attendee app is about as complex as the actor app, but doesn’t have a Headless mode (which is really just a power-user feature for actors). This app has multiple screens corresponding to the different phases of the show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preshow - A lobby screen where attendees can meet the shipmates they’ll be flying with</li>
  <li>Intro - A tutorial video</li>
  <li>Freeplay - The bulk of the show, where attendees alternate between interacting with characters and choosing their next destination from the Navigation Screen</li>
  <li>Ending - A livestreamed 3D ending scene</li>
  <li>Ended - This just redirects attendees out of the app to <a href="https://shatteredspace.live/program.html" target="_blank">a static page with our casts’ bios</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://chrisuehlinger.com/images/shattered/screenshots/host-app.jpg">
<strong>My setup for performing the motion capture at the end of the show</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the show, I perform a scene as Colonel Panic, the AI commander of the Star Jockeys. In this scene I go around to each ship and review the items they’ve managed to collect. Then a “resolution” happens that I won’t spoil here.</p>

<p>This performance is rendered on my desktop PC (Intel 8700K + RTX 2080TI) with a special version of the Actor app that I’ve built just for this purpose. The three.js scene here involves at least 7 huge models with MeshPhysicalMaterials and a dozen moving PointLights, so rather than rendering on attendees’ computers, I render it on mine and stream it to them using an <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link-4k" target="_blank">Elgato Camlink 4K</a>, ffmpeg and the Janus (explained below) <a href="https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/streaming.html" target="_blank">Streaming plugin</a>.</p>

<p>The motion capture work is done by taking a modified version of Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/tracking_and_visualizing_faces" target="_blank">TrackingAndVisualizingFaces</a> example from the ARKit docs and having it send each frame of mocap data over WebSockets to the server, which then forwards them to the Host app. It’s amazing that this works with sub-100ms latency, but it does.</p>

<p>I’m planning on open-sourcing all of this when the show is done, but I’d want to purge the git history in case there are any secrets lying around, and I’d warn any interested spelunkers that it will be more of an …</p></div></div>

<h2>A multiplayer board game in Rust and WebAssembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://pont.mattkeeter.com/">
<img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/screenshot.png">
</a></p><p>
<a href="https://pont.mattkeeter.com/">Click to play!</a>
</p>
<p><em>Pont</em> is an online implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle">Qwirkle, a board game by Mindware Games</a>.
It was written for my parents,
so they could play with friends and family during the COVID-19 stay-at-home era.</p>
<p>Play is split into <strong>rooms</strong>,
which are identified by a three-word code
(<code>size moody shape</code> in the image above).
Within each room,
the game distributes pieces,
enforces the game rules,
and provides a local chat window.</p>
<p>Unusually, it's a web-based multiplayer game <strong>without any Javascript</strong>:
both the client and server are written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
which is compiled into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> to run on the browser.
(There's a Javascript shim to load the WebAssembly module, but I didn't have to write it myself)</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, I'm <em>not a web developer</em>,
so this is probably a weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">outsider architecture</a>
for web applications.
Here's what the system looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/diagram.svg" alt="Diagram"></p>
<p>The system uses <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> for certificates:
both static assets and WebSocket communication are encrypted
between the client and the server.
The game server does not communicate securely with the NGINX proxy,
but if anyone is on the server watching,
I've got bigger problems.</p>
<p>The <code>wasm</code> bundle and <code>pont-server</code> executable are both
written in Rust and managed in the <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont"><code>pont</code> repository</a>.
They both depend on <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs"><code>pont-common</code></a>,
which defines basic types and logic for gameplay
(e.g. so that both the client and server can check whether a move is legal).</p>
<p>The client and server communicate via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a>.
Messages are strongly typed as an <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs#L7-L48"><code>enum</code> in <code>pont-common</code></a>,

<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The game server using async Rust,
which was... exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ej649l/a_summary_of_the_current_state_of_async_rust/fcw16a9/">"very polite cold war"</a>
going on between the two major (incompatible?) runtimes,
with packages that only work in one or the other</li>

<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html">channels</a></li>
<li>General confusion between <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/"><code>futures</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/index.html"><code>std::Future</code></a>, and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-util/0.3.5/futures_util/"><code>futures_util</code></a>
(exacerbated by the fact that Googling for things will land you
into a random version of the docs)</li>
<li>Error messages that rival C++ in incomprehensibility</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, the Rust <code>async</code> ecosystem is relatively new,
so most of this can be ascribed to growing pains;
I'm sure that the ergonomics and library situation
will improve over time.</p>
<p>I ended up using the <a href="https://github.com/stjepang/smol"><code>smol</code> runtime</a>
because it's got relatively few dependencies,
and I appreciated that it wasn't trying to own the entire async universe
(unlike Tokio and <code>async-std</code>).</p>
<p>After getting over those hurdles,
the server architecture is relatively straightforward.
A bunch of independent tasks run asynchronously,
communicating to the outside world via WebSockets
and internally via <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/fn.unbounded.html">unbounded MPSC queues</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the server running one game (with two players),
plus one new client who has just connected.  Each rectangle
represents an async task:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/server.svg" alt="Server"></p>
<p>The system has <code>2 + n_players + n_games</code> async tasks running at one time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-level task which accepts incoming connections.</li>
<li>A top-level task which logs the number of active rooms, once per minute</li>
<li>One async task per client connection, which passes messages between the WebSocket connection
and the application's internal queues.</li>
<li>One async task per room, which handles game state</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks each map to a <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/0.1.10/smol/struct.Task.html"><code>smol::Task</code></a>.
(As a small optimization,
the first player's <code>Task</code> handles both the player communication
and running the room, which is why they're both blue in the diagram above)</p>
<p>The server compiles down to a 5 MB static binary.
The whole system is hosted on the smallest VM offered by
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>,
which is a $5/month machine.
I'm looking forward to the inevitable <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">DDOS</a>,
where I can see how well it scales!</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The client is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs">2000 lines of framework-less excitement</a>.
It uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine pattern</a>
to represent the flow of the game,
accepting messages from the server
and updating the state accordingly:
for example, top-level state flows from
<code>Connecting</code> to <code>CreateOrJoin</code> to <code>Playing</code>.</p>
<p>The game board is represented as an SVG;
everything else is standard HTML elements.
In fact, the whole UI is pre-constructed in
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/deploy/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a>
and revealed on demand.</p>
<p>The client has a bit of polish:
Pieces are animated as they move around the board,
and there's an optional color-blind mode,
which adds corner markings to indicate color.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/cb.png" alt="Color-blind mode"></p>
<p>I use direct DOM manipulation
(from the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/"><code>web-sys</code></a> crate)
to control the system.
This exercise has left me appreciating the usefulness of virtual DOMs,
but I didn't want to bring in the complexity of a framework.
(Is there a Rust + <code>wasm</code> version of <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> yet?)</p>
<p>For deployment,
I'm using <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>
and serving the resulting <code>wasm</code> blob from the same server as the other static assets.</p>
<p>The main challenges on the client side were
(of course) dealing with cross-browser compatibility:
Safari, in particular, supports fewer features
and has funky handling of touch events.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>After a bit of a learning curve,
this all worked surprisingly well!</p>
<p>The client side is still a bit messy,
with animations, UI inputs,
and server events all fighting to break the system's invariants.
For example,
there was a nasty bug where dragging the board while
an animation was running could drop the system into an invalid state.</p>
<p>This isn't surprising:
stateful UIs are hard,
which explains the popularity of declarative approaches.
At this point, the client is feature-complete
and hasn't quite collapsed under its own weight,
so I'm not inclined to do any dramatic refactorings.</p>
<p>Rust as a language continues to be great,
despite minor complaints.
I already discussed the async ecosystem above,
and won't dwell on that any further.
On the client side,
there are often impedance mismatches with WebAssembly:
for example, using Rust closures as callbacks
requires
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs#L1189-L1211">cryptic boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, with all of the pieces in place,
making changes is pleasantly fast,
and I trust the compiler to check that I haven't broken anything.</p>
<p>I'm particularly happy with the combination of WebSockets, Serde, and bincode:
having both the client and server process a strongly-typed stream of events
makes things easy to reason about.</p>

 <p>
  As I am currently right in the middle of a far-reaching rework of Genode's
  low-level GUI stack, I'd like to share a bit of background behind this work:
  the Why, the What, and the How.
 </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="Current_state"></a>
 Current state</h4>
  <p>
   The current incarnation of Genode's low-level GUI-related interfaces is almost
   identical to the very first version that we originally created in 2006.
   Genode has a very strong asymmetric notion of the
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/architecture/Recursive_system_structure.html#Client-server_relationship">relationship</a>
   between client and server components. In this relationship, the client depends
   on the server but the server does not depend on the client.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the lowest level, the framebuffer driver and input driver(s) were
   envisioned as servers that provide the <i>Framebuffer</i> and <i>Input</i> session
   interfaces to higher-level GUI components. From our former academic view, this
   felt natural because those drivers <i>provide</i> <i>resources</i> to other components.
   Provide... serve... server! The nitpicker GUI server uses those low-level
   services to implement a higher level service that ultimately allows for the
   multiplexing of graphics and input.
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/components/Common_session_interfaces.html#Nitpicker_GUI">Nitpicker</a>
   virtualizes the low-level framebuffer and input interfaces while supplementing
   the notions of visible views and input focus. Such a system looks as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_orig.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   The drivers and the nitpicker GUI server are displayed in red because they are
   servers. The GUI applications at the right are nitpicker clients. Nitpicker,
   in turn, is a client of the framebuffer and input drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The client interface of the nitpicker GUI server is success story. A few
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.11#GUI_stack">evolutionary tweaks</a>
   notwithstanding, the original design scales up to the windowed working
   environment of Sculpt OS while retaining the tiny complexity of the nitpicker
   GUI server.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the approach of modelling the framebuffer and input drivers as
   servers is a dead end, for the following reasons.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers are sometimes extremely complex. When looking at the complexity of
     the Intel framebuffer driver (ported from the Linux kernel) for example, it
     feels foolish to trust that it won't fail. Because the nitpicker GUI server
     depends on the liveliness of the driver, however, the well-being of the
     driver is on the critical path for the entire GUI stack and all GUI
     applications.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     It is impossible to transparently restart or replace the driver at runtime
     without also restarting the GUI stack and - transitively - all GUI
     applications. This is because the nitpicker GUI server is connected as a
     client to the drivers. The connections are like a life supply for the GUI
     server. Cutting those would ultimately kill the GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding secondary displays is rather difficult because this would require
     nitpicker to know what framebuffer servers are out there and to request
     multiple framebuffer connections. Adding such a protocol would inflate
     the complexity of nitpicker.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <h4>
 <a name="Inverting_interfaces"></a>
 Inverting interfaces</h4>
  <p>
   To overcome these limitations, we must break the dependency of the GUI
   server from the drivers, like illustrated here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_next.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   In this scenario, the GUI server no longer <i>uses</i> the drivers, but the drivers
   use the GUI server. The relationship is reversed. Only the nitpicker GUI
   server remains red. Of course, the drivers cannot talk to nitpicker GUI
   server via nitpicker's regular client interface. Instead, two new interfaces
   enter the picture:
  </p>
  <div><dl>
   <dt>The <i>Capture</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Framebuffer</i> session interface. It allows a client to obtain pixel data
     from the server. From the GUI server's perspective, a framebuffer driver
     is like a frame capturing device - which it is.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>The <i>Event</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Input</i> session interface. In contrast to a input session, which allows
     a client to obtain input events, an event session allows a client to
     induce input events. Nitpicker is an event server that consumes the input
     events from the driver(s).
    </p>
   </dd>
  </dl></div>
  <p>
   The benefits of this approach are manifold:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The low-complexity GUI server remains as the only component that must never
     fail, which makes the GUI stack much more resilient compared to today.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Since the nitpicker GUI server no longer depends on the drivers, it can be
     started before the drivers are running, speeding up the boot time of
     graphical scenarios. In scenarios with rigid power management, we can remove
     the graphics driver - and switch off the graphics device - all while the GUI
     server and all GUI applications stay intact.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers can be restarted anytime. From the perspective of the nitpicker
     GUI server, this looks like a client disconnect and connect. Drivers
     can also be replaced at runtime, e.g., swapping out the VESA and Intel
     drivers.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Connecting more than one driver to the nitpicker GUI server becomes
     conceptually simple. This clears the path towards multi-head support.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The new capture session interface of the nitpicker GUI server would be
     the right hook for implementing screenshot/screencast applications, or a
     remote desktop server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Analogously to capture devices, input devices can enter and leave the
     system at any time without disruption, which will allow for the fine-grained
     management of USB HID devices. Think of plugging a new HID device to
     your Sculpt system. A new USB device would show up.
     The user can deploy the matching HID driver with the option of routing the
     event session of the driver to the system GUI server. Isn't that wonderful?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   What is the downside? <i>It is a lot of work!</i> This leads us the following
   section.
  </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="The_plan"></a>
 The plan</h4>
  <p>
   Turning the low-level session interfaces upside down is an invasive operation
   that must be carried out in several steps, each yielding an intermediate
   consistent state.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     We start off with some low-risk <b>cosmetic</b> changes, namely the renaming
     of the "Nitpicker" session interface to "Gui" session. The strange
     branding of the session interface after a particular implementation is a
     relic from the early days. This
     <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3778">change</a> has already
     entered Genode's master branch.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Consistently use <b>32-bit RGB</b> as pixel format by all drivers and
     applications. This is a long-standing feature request that eliminates
     the need for color-space conversions and generally improves the output
     quality.
     It is quite labor-intensive because it requires me testing many
     different hardware platforms covering the drivers vesa_fb_drv, fb_sdl,
     intel_fb_drv, imx53_fb_drv, imx8_fb_drv, rpi_fb_drv, boot_fb_drv,
     omap4_fb_drv, exynos5_fb_drv.
     This <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3784">change</a> has already
     progressed well.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Capture</b> session <b>interface</b>.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Implementing the <b>capture service</b> in the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introduce a <b>nitpicker</b> option to choose the framebuffer <b>back end</b> between
     the use of a requested framebuffer session (as done today), the use of a
     capture client for the pixel output, or the use of another GUI server
     (for stacking multiple instance of nitpicker).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Turn "Framebuffer" <b>drivers</b> into "Capture" clients, covering all the
     drivers mentioned above. Shoveling code. Adjusting all existing
     scenarios to use nitpicker's capture service.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Pruning</b> the remaining use of the <b>framebuffer client</b> interface.
     In fact, when done, I want to remove the <tt>Framebuffer::Connection</tt>
     completely. This will require the reworking of the terminal, MESA back end,
     several tests, and the liquid_framebuffer. In the process, I hope to largely
     eliminate the use cases of the nit_fb (now called gui_fb) component so
     that this component can be removed in the end.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Turning</b> a few other <b>framebuffer clients</b> into "Capture" servers, in
     particular test-framebuffer, fb_bench, and test-driver_manager.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Removal</b> of the "Framebuffer" <b>session interface</b>, retaining the interface
     merely as a part of the GUI session.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Event</b> session <b>interface</b> and adding its implementation
     to the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding a new <b>event_filter component</b> taking the place of the input_filter.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     With the structural changes done, it would be time for optimizations.
     As a prerequisite for tear-free animations, the <b>frame buffering</b> will be
     moved from the clients into the nitpicker GUI server. At first, this will be
     transparent to most clients. The subsequent removal of client-side buffering
     is second independent step. As another optimization, I plan to go though all
     places that employed the dithering of pixels.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Of those topics, the rework of the framebuffer drivers is certainly the most
   elaborate one. I'm considering to drop the Exynos5 and OMAP4 drivers.
   Even though I strive for replacing the input session interface by the new
   event session interface, the scope of the task of reworking the input drivers
   is not yet completely tangible to me.

                                        <p>As someone who grew up throughout the 90's and 00's, some of my fondest memories stem from progressive advancements in internet and computing technologies.  Upgrading from Dial-Up internet to DSL was a grand event in our house.  I remember my brother and I fighting over the computer day in and day out to play games like Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory, which was released in 2003. (I'm convinced that this will be the all-time best FPS game ever created.)  At around the same time, we upgraded to one of the best Dell computer's available at the time. It had 512MB of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor.  This was a major upgrade from our Compaq Celeron, which had something like 64MB of RAM. <br>

<p>Eventually, the grandeur of DSL faded as the rest of the world began to adopt Cable and Fiber internet.  It wasn't until I briefly moved to Philadelphia that I was finally able to experienced what I had been missing out on.  In college I lived in a neighborhood that was one of Verizon's first Fios builds.  I was absolutely blown away by the 25 Mbps connection.  This was in 2009. I'm amazed that over a decade later, in 2020, some households still don't have access to cable or fiber internet yet.</p>

<p>Like many of our customers do now, I could never figure out why it was so difficult to get us fiber service.  The cable is cheap, just throw it up on a pole and give me internet! Right?  Well, not so fast... <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/1849761.jpg" alt="Fiber Spaghetti"></p>

<p>A quick overview of how utility services are run and the challenges involved...</p>

<p>As most people know, there are primarily two ways to deliver utility services to a home or business.  Aerial and underground.  Water, gas, and sewer are always serviced underground for obvious reasons.  Electric, telephone, cable, and fiber have the ability to either be above or below ground.</p>

<h3 id="aerial">Aerial.</h3>

<p>As with anything else, aerial has pro's and con's.</p>

<p>The pro's are primarily upfront costs (this is debatable) and speed of deployment (this is also debatable).</p>

<p>The con's are that contrary to it being cheaper to physically deploy, the pole owners generally charge up-front make ready fee's.  These fees can range from $0 to upwards of $50,000/mile.  It's essentially pay to play.  If we want to attach to 50 poles, the pole owner might determine that 10 of those poles are old and need to be replaced before we can attach to them.  Rather than fork up the cash themselves, they'll force us to pay to replace their poles in order to approve the attachment.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are the annual pole fee's.  Depending on your agreement, we've seen pole fee's ranging anywhere from $7/pole per year all the way up to $43/pole per year with 10% annual increases (I'm looking at you PPL.  This ridiculous rate was purely intended to keep us from attaching to their poles, IMO.  It's impossible to make money with these rates). <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-22.04.34.png" alt="Pole Rates"></p>

<p>Another con is that even though installing the cable on poles is faster, it usually takes the pole owner around 6 months just to review applications and to determine make ready requirements and costs.  As an example, if we have fiber on a pole that's 1 pole short from being able to service your house, it would take at least 6 months just to run fiber to that one additional pole. So close, yet so far.</p>

<h3 id="underground">Underground.</h3>

<p>Like aerial, underground has its own list of pro's and con's.</p>

<p>When you install a service underground, you own it for life.  There are no annual fee's.  You pay one time to install it and you're set for life.  This sounds like a pro, but it's also a con.  When we run metro conduit, it generally costs us between $15-25/ft (not including customer drops).  For the sake of argument, let's assume we're at the high-end of our costs.  If we install 1,000ft of conduit, that's $25,000 that we need to pay out of pocket upfront.  Some blocks have upwards of 30 customers, but others have as little as 5.  Let's average it out at 20 customers per block, that's $1,250 upfront per customer, assuming we get every single customer.  Conservatively, we're initially looking at a 50% take rate.  This could grow to 100% overtime, but we never make that assumption. So that's $2,500/customer.  Imagine spending $2,500 per house/building and then have them tell you that your $69/m service is too expensive.  Generally speaking, we won't do a street unless our numbers look better than this, but this is a realistic scenario as we scale and get access to cheaper capital, etc.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>Cost issues aside, there are a number of other hurdles one needs to get past just to begin the process of building out a network.  You'd think that risking everything you have in an effort to bring your local economy into the 21st Century would be a welcome sight.  That's what I thought too; was I wrong.  While there are plenty of supporters (I truly appreciate you all), there are just as many, if not more, critics.</p>

<p>We've been fortunate enough to have had a handful of people get behind us overtime and give us a shot.  I'm sure others haven't had it so easy.  I know this because even after we've become an established player in our city throughout the past 4 years, neighboring townships and municipalities haven't been as opened armed to welcome us into their communities as I had anticipated or would have liked.</p>

<p>I'll go into more detail on small government policies that really hamper our ability to deploy underground later below.</p>

<h3 id="toomanyopinions">Too Many Opinions</h3>

<p>I'm generally a big fan of individual citizens trying to make an impact in their communities.  However, in too many cases these contributions seem to be made in the form of unproductive complaints rather than productive feedback or action.  Far too many people have a say in things that they probably shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case A.</em></strong></p>

<p>A new customer had recently signed an agreement with us to run fiber into their building.  This is a non-profit who's members are selflessly donating their time to restore a landmark in the community.  Upon receiving their signature, I notified the city that we would be pulling a permit to connect the building in question to our underground network.  They said okay; that was that.  Our nearest existing hand hole is approximately 90ft to the right of the new customer's property; in front of another property.  As a courtesy, I notified the manager of that establishment to let her know that we would be performing work over the weekend, from Friday into Saturday.  They're closed Saturday and Sunday so I had assumed they would appreciate the notice and possibly even sign up with us.  The project would involve removing 90ft of sidewalk, running conduit, and then restoring the sidewalk with brand spankin' new concrete.  The total timespan that this would occur, from when our shovel hit the ground to having new sidewalks in place, would be 48 hrs.  The response that I received from a member of their organization made me facepalm.</p>

<p><img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-18.53.55-copy.png" alt="Sidewalk Issues"></p>

<p>Not long after receiving this email, I became aware that they didn't even own the building in question, nevermind the sidewalk.  They lease it.  This was eventually "resolved" after a series of negotiations between the non-profit's president and the establishment in question.  Often times we aren't as lucky.</p>

<p>We initially planned to have this new customer installed within a week of them signing the contract.  Now it will end up being around 2 months from start to finish.  Long story short, I learned my lesson in trying to be courteous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case B.</em></strong></p>

<p>Last year we were installing conduit for our fiber optic network.  There were countless instances where people would literally stop their cars, roll down their windows, and yell profanities at us.  In what world is that acceptable behavior for an adult? I can't imagine being so far off my rocker that I would feel the need to yell at a bunch of construction workers trying to build a fiber optic network (not that they had any idea what we were doing).  If these are the types of people influencing decisions, there's something wrong.</p>

<p>City workers have a tough job fielding complaints from people like this and I commend them for it.  It shouldn't affect policy though.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case C.</em></strong></p>

<p>In another incident that took place not long, maybe a day or two, after <em>Case B</em> above.  A local store owner came back to us as we're swinging pick axes in 95 degree heat telling us we need to hurry up and we should hire more workers.  "My customers keep calling saying there's no where to park."  Mind you, we're standing right next to a massive parking lot that is approximately 1/3rd full.  I made my best attempt to kindly explain that paying 3 guys to stand around a hole to watch one person hand-dig to expose a utility isn't going to make our work go any faster.  I don't think he liked my response.</p>

<h3 id="theconsequences">The Consequences</h3>

<p>In many cases, resident complaints are justified.  Utility providers need to be held accountable for shitty restoration work.  However, the way in which bad restoration work is being combated is counter productive.  There has been a huge increase in curb-to-curb restoration requirements by local governments.  Essentially what these rules state is that anytime a utility cuts asphalt beyond a predetermined length, say 100ft, they are then responsible for replacing the entire road surface from the curb on the left side of the street to the curb on the right side of the street.  I believe some municipalities are also trying to introduce these measures to offload the costs of repaving roads themselves, similar to how pole owners force you to replace their aging utility poles under their make-ready requirements.  (One municipality told me as much when I attended a local council meeting in an effort to get them to waive this ridiculous ordinance for us.)</p>

<p>These policies will ultimately do more harm than good.  For us, these are the one and only thing preventing us from providing superior fiber internet services in these areas.  Forcing curb-to-curb asphalt …</p></div></div></div>
