<p>Vim is a highly customizable text editor geared towards writing code.
But open-ended configuration possibilities often lure users into wasting time while chasing after perceived minute gains in productivity.
This article describes my Vim journey, starting from heavy personal customization and ending with a renewed love for defaults.</p>

<h2 id="porn">Porn</h2>

<p>As a rule, new users, right after introduction to a few basic commands, start indulging in Vim configuration porn.
Such porn has various different flavours.
There is the “exhibitionist” variety which includes dressing Vim up in status lines, colorschemes, and font decorations in order to impress others.
It often leads to Vim being displayed on videos and, nomen omen, “vim-porn” screenshots.
There is an “integrated” category where people plug and stretch their Vim until it resembles an IDE.
Git integration, autocompletion, language servers, refactoring, and debugging are the tools of trade in this version.
And then there are a few more variants, including “fuzzy”, “packaged”, “conveniently re-mapped”, and I am sure anyone could think up some of their own.</p>

<p>My particular genre was “consistency” - I wanted my Vim to be intuitive and predictable.
While working I would constantly keep an eye for digressions in Vim’s behaviour and then spend my time trying to adjust them.
In my fantasy Vim had to feel intuitive and smooth so I tried to correct every little detail.
And, despite “consistency” porn being quite vanilla, I managed to construct a <code>vimrc</code> file exceeding one thousand lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="consistentvimrc">Consistent vimrc</h2>

<p>No point in sharing the entire collection, but here are a few illustrative examples and the rationale behind them.
Feel free to try them out, if that is your thing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Y</p>

<p>As is widely known <code>Y</code> is not consistent with other uppercase commands.
It copies the whole line while <code>D</code> and <code>C</code> operates from the cursor position to the end of line.
Simple remap fixes the issue.</p>

<pre><code>" make Y consistent with C and D.
nnoremap Y y$
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>n</code> and <code>N</code></p>

<p>Having the same characters always go in the same direction would be a lot easier.
So this map makes <code>n</code> always go forwards and <code>N</code> always go backwards<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.
Same for <code>;</code> and <code>,</code><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<pre><code>" make n always search forward and N backward
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; n 'Nn'[v:searchforward]
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; N 'nN'[v:searchforward]

" make ; always "find" forward and , backward
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; ; getcharsearch().forward ? ';' : ','
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; , getcharsearch().forward ? ',' : ';'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>;</code> and <code>,</code></p>

<p>I disliked the forward and backward <code>f</code> repetition being under different characters: <code>;</code> and <code>,</code>.
This set of remaps puts them under the same key and moves away the colon command over to backtick.
The original backtick behaviour is transferred to a single quote.</p>

<pre><code>" make ; and , be on the same key
nnoremap : ,
nnoremap ` :
nnoremap ' `
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>l</code></p>

<p>This set of mappings makes the <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>l</code> keys perform consistent direction-related action in various circumstances: scrolling, changing and creating windows, moving across paragraphs.</p>

<pre><code>" make J, K, L, and H move the cursor MORE.
nnoremap J }
nnoremap K {
nnoremap L g_
nnoremap H ^

" make &lt;c-j&gt;, &lt;c-k&gt;, &lt;c-l&gt;, and &lt;c-h&gt; scroll the screen.
nnoremap &lt;c-j&gt; &lt;c-e&gt;
nnoremap &lt;c-k&gt; &lt;c-y&gt;
nnoremap &lt;c-l&gt; zl
nnoremap &lt;c-h&gt; zh

" make &lt;a-j&gt;, &lt;a-k&gt;, &lt;a-l&gt;, and &lt;a-h&gt; move to window.
nnoremap &lt;a-j&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;j
nnoremap &lt;a-k&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;k
nnoremap &lt;a-l&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;l
nnoremap &lt;a-h&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;h

" make &lt;a-J&gt;, &lt;a-K&gt;, &lt;a-L&gt;, and &lt;a-H&gt; create windows.
nnoremap &lt;a-J&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;s&lt;c-w&gt;k
nnoremap &lt;a-K&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;s
nnoremap &lt;a-H&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;v
nnoremap &lt;a-L&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;v&lt;c-w&gt;h
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>J</code> and <code>K</code>.</p>

<p>If you think about how Vim moves across sentences and words you will notice that it doesn’t place the cursor on the empty space between them, but rather on the first and last characters.
Similarly this bad boy makes <code>J</code> and <code>K</code> commands place the cursor on the outermost lines while moving from paragraph to paragraph.
Consistent.</p>

<pre><code>" move to the edge of a paragraph.
function! s:Move(isUp, isInVisual)
  if a:isInVisual
    normal! gv
  end
  let curpos = getcurpos()
  let firstline='\(^\s*\n\)\zs\s*\S\+'
  let lastline ='\s*\S\+\ze\n\s*$'
  let flags = 'Wn'. (a:isUp ? 'b' : '')
  " Move to first or last line of paragraph, or to the beginning/end of file
  let pat = '\('.firstline.'\|'.lastline.'\)\|\%^\|\%$'
  " make sure cursor moves and search does not get stuck on current line
  call cursor(line('.'), a:isUp ? 1 : col('$'))
  let target=search(pat, flags)
  if target &gt; 0
    let curpos[1]=target
    let curpos[2]=curpos[4]
  end
  call setpos('.',curpos)
endfu

" H K L J for moving to paragraph edge
nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; J :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(0, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; K :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(1, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
vnoremap &lt;silent&gt; J :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(0, 1)&lt;cr&gt;
vnoremap &lt;silent&gt; K :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(1, 1)&lt;cr&gt;
onoremap J V:call &lt;sid&gt;Move(0, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
onoremap K V:call &lt;sid&gt;Move(1, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>ge</code></p>

<p>To understand the inconsistency with <code>ge</code> consider how Vim behaves across 4 distinct commands:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor position       Command        Result
------------------------------------------------
word1 word2           de             wo word2
  ^                   dw             woword2

word1 word2           db             word1 rd2
        ^             dge            wordd2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>dge</code> is inconsistent in two ways: first, unlike <code>db</code>, it deletes the character under the cursor; second, unlike <code>dw</code>, it deletes the last character of the word it moves towards.
Remap below made it more consistent.</p>

<pre><code>" make commands with ge consistent with b and w
onoremap ge :execute "normal! " . v:count1 . "ge&lt;space&gt;"&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>&amp;</code></p>

<p>Here remap makes the substitution repeat command reuse the flags of the previous invocation.</p>

<pre><code>" make substitution repeat to reuse last flags
nnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;cr&gt;
xnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let that be the end of examples.
I had many more but you probably get the point by now.
The simple truth is that my thousand line vimrc file didn’t give me any comfort.
The feeling I had when I opened it up is best described as a kind of anxiety.
I often felt a weird push to improve it, organize it better, make it more consistent.
Until one day I had enough and pressed delete.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="afreshstart">A fresh start</h2>

<p>So, no more vimrc.
It did feel sloppy, at first.
But I quickly found a new way to get around.</p>

<p>Some of the issues with highly customized configuration files are known to everyone.
You have to use a plugin to manage your plugins; have to transfer dotfiles across different servers; lose the ability to work on machines without your configuration files; others cannot use your computer without disabling your setup first.
Removing the heavy configuration got rid of those downsides.
But in addition I noticed a few additional less talked about benefits which are listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reduced confusion</p>

<p>When my vimrc grew, it became harder to remember all the maps and remaps that were in there.
So when adjusting configuration sometimes I would overwrite my previous mappings and other times I would apply the same “consistency fix” twice, in two slightly different ways, ending up with two different keys being remapped to the same operation.
In general changing things or reading and searching the help pages became cumbersome.</p>

<p>And proper fixes are often hard, harder than you might think.
Take even the simplest example: making <code>cw</code> consistent with <code>dw</code>.
Maybe some haven’t noticed but in Vim <code>cw</code> behaves like <code>ce</code>: it changes text to the end of the current word, not to the beginning of the next word.
It looks like an easy thing to change but the best known implementation is close to 20 lines of vimscript<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>, and there is no guarantee that it is perfect.
You always have to track various edge cases and add checks for different modes, empty lines, end of file situations.
Without such careful treatment the fix will be inconsistent itself.</p>

<p>In addition some consistency bandages themselves introduced inconsistencies in other places.
As an example take the remap between colon and comma.
Remember - I remapped colon to be consistent with semicolon and transferred the original command-line operation to backtick.
But this left <code>g;</code> and <code>g,</code> unadjusted which is, you guessed it, still inconsistent.
Even if we adjust them the <code>":</code> register is still there.
So, to redo the last command-line operation I still have to call <code>@:</code> even if my command-line operation itself is now under backtick.
Those inconsistencies never end.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased flexibility</p>

<p>I became accustomed to my simplified mappings and slowly but surely lost the ability to control more complex commands.
A good example is my <code>&lt;leader&gt;R</code> map:</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;R :belowright 20split | terminal R --no-save --no-restore&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It opened up a <code>:terminal</code> buffer below the current window, set it to 20 lines in height, and launched R in it.
Sweet little command, right?
Well yes.
But it only allowed me to open R in a fixed size window.
It somehow took away my knowledge of opening a window anywhere, in any size, and running any command in it.
I got used to this simplicity so much I was no longer able to open python in a 30 line height window without checking the syntax of my R remap in the vimrc first.</p>

<p>Using registers is another good example.
One map I had was <code>&lt;leader&gt;y</code> which copied the text into the system clipboard.
Simple, convenient, and fast.
When it was no longer there I was forced to issue the full command, which is <code>"+y</code>.
It may be slightly less convenient but seeing and using this syntax makes it clear what is going on and it naturally encourages the use of different registers.
When I got in the habit of yanking text into the <code>+</code> register my usage of custom registers became much more frequent as a side effect.
A new side of Vim, previously layered by my custom remaps, opened up and expanded.</p>

<p>Similar thing happened with yanking text and using it to replace another piece of text.
It is a common enough procedure and so I turned to plugins for help.
Using a plugin<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> was convenient.
It was so convenient that I didn’t have to think about it, just yank text, issue an operator, define a motion, and bam - the replacement took place.
After I …</p></li></ul></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div inner_tag="div"><div><div><p><strong>In the global race to measure ever shorter time spans, physicists from Goethe University Frankfurt have now taken the lead: together with colleagues at the accelerator facility DESY in Hamburg and the Fritz-Haber-Institute in Berlin, they have measured a process that lies within the realm of zeptoseconds for the first time: the propagation of light within a molecule. A zeptosecond is a trillionth of a billionth of a second (10-21 seconds).<br></strong><br>FRANKFURT. In 1999, the Egyptian chemist Ahmed Zewail received the Nobel Prize for measuring the speed at which molecules change their shape. He founded femtochemistry using ultrashort laser flashes: the formation and breakup of chemical bonds occurs in the realm of femtoseconds. A femtosecond equals 0.000000000000001 seconds, or 10-15 seconds. </p><p>Now atomic physicists at Goethe University in Professor Reinhard Dörner's team have for the first time studied a process that is shorter than femtoseconds by magnitudes. They measured how long it takes for a photon to cross a hydrogen molecule: about 247 zeptoseconds for the average bond length of the molecule. This is the shortest timespan that has been successfully measured to date.</p><p>The scientists carried out the time measurement on a hydrogen molecule (H2) which they irradiated with X-rays from the synchrotron lightsource PETRA III at the Hamburg accelerator centre DESY. The researchers set the energy of the X-rays so that one photon was sufficient to eject both electrons out of the hydrogen molecule.</p><p>Electrons behave like particles and waves simultaneously, and therefore the ejection of the first electron resulted in electron waves launched first in the one, and then in the second hydrogen molecule atom in quick succession, with the waves merging.</p><p>The photon behaved here much like a flat pebble that is skimmed twice across the water: when a&nbsp; wave trough meets a wave crest, the waves of the first and second water contact cancel each other, resulting in what is called an interference pattern.</p><p>The scientists measured the interference pattern of the first ejected electron using the COLTRIMS reaction microscope, an apparatus that Dörner helped develop and which makes ultrafast reaction processes in atoms and molecules visible. Simultaneously with the interference pattern, the COLTRIMS reactions microscope also allowed the determination of the orientation of the hydrogen molecule. The researchers here took advantage of the fact that the second electron also left the hydrogen molecule, so that the remaining hydrogen nuclei flew apart and were detected.</p><p>&nbsp;“Since we knew the spatial orientation of the hydrogen molecule, we used the interference of the two electron waves to precisely calculate when the photon reached the first and when it reached the second hydrogen atom," explains Sven Grundmann whose doctoral dissertation forms the basis of the scientific article in Science. “And this is up to 247 zeptoseconds, depending on how far apart in the molecule the two atoms were from the perspective of light."</p><p>Professor Reinhard Dörner adds: “We observed for the first time that the electron shell in a molecule does not react to light everywhere at the same time. The time delay occurs because information within the molecule only spreads at the speed of light. With this finding we have extended our COLTRIMS technology to another application."</p><p><strong>Publication: </strong>Sven Grundmann, Daniel Trabert, Kilian Fehre, Nico Strenger, Andreas Pier, Leon Kaiser, Max Kircher, Miriam Weller, Sebastian Eckart, Lothar Ph.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main id="main-content-container"><article aria-label="GDPR watchdog’s investigation finds that tracking and consent pop-ups used by Google and other major websites and apps are unlawful."><div>
<p>The Belgian Data Protection Authority (APD-GBA) has found serious GDPR infringements in the system Google and others use to legitimise online tracking. The system behind nearly all of the consent messages that pop up on screens in Europe has been found to infringe the GDPR. The APD-GBA is the lead enforcer on this issue for the EU.</p>



<p>The system is known as the “Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (TCF)”. It was introduced by the tracking industry’s standards body, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) as an attempt to convince enforcers that online advertising’s controversial “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) system was compliant with the GDPR. Google started to use the TCF this year.</p>



<p>But the IAB’s system allows companies to swap sensitive information about people, even when this has not been authorised. According to the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service, </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“IAB Europe’s approach demonstrates that it neglects the risks that would impact on the rights and freedoms of data subjects”. &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>RTB operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. It constantly broadcasts the private things that people do and watch online to tracking companies. It also tells them where we are in the real world. There is no way of limiting what then happens to any of these data.</p>



<p>Europe’s RTB advertising market was worth €6.7bn in 2019. There is no estimate of the market value of personal data gathered through the RTB system. However, publishers have been increasingly worried about the theft of their audiences through the RTB system.</p>



<p>According to the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service, the IAB does not provide adequate controls for the processing of the most intimate data, which the GDPR calls “special category” data. &nbsp;Last month the Irish Council for Civil Liberties <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/human-rights/info-privacy/rtb-data-breach-2-years-on/">revealed that RTB data was used to profile LGBT+ people to influence a national election</a>, and that RTB data had been used to profile victims of incest and sexual abuse.</p>



<p>The Belgian findings come as part of a campaign of GDPR complaints against the RTB data breach launched two years ago by <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/staff/dr-johnny-ryan/">Dr Johnny Ryan</a> of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, who was then a tech executive. He said: </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“the pop-ups that plague us tens of times a day were an attempt to paint a thin legal veneer over the vast data breach at the heart of the behavioural advertising system. The Belgian Data Protection Authority is rightly peeling this veneer off, and exposing massive illegality in online behavioural advertising”</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>United States</strong></p>



<p>The IAB offers legal guidance to the global tracking industry. In October it began to market a system based on the TCF for California’s new privacy law, the CCPA. In August, it launched the IAB Privacy Lab, to lobby lawmakers and produce variants of the TCF for regional laws.</p>



<p>But the Belgian privacy watchdog has now found that even the privacy policy on the IAB’s own website infringes the GDPR, and that the IAB has failed to appoint a data protection officer. </p>



<p>Pierre Dewitte, of the University of Leuven, a complainant, said</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“the findings about the IAB’s poor internal GDPR compliance show its lack of expertise, or interest, in the most elementary aspects of data protection and privacy law”</em>. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The Belgian authority’s report says <em>“the Inspection Service believes that IAB Europe is trying to avoid its liability to the GDPR, constituting an aggravating circumstance”</em>. </p>



<p>Ravi Naik, solicitor who worked on the original complaints, said </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“These findings are damning and overdue. As the standard setters, the IAB is responsible for breaches of the GDPR. Their supervisory authority has rightly found that the IAB “neglects” the risks to data subjects. The IAB’s responsibility now is to stop these&nbsp;breaches”</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service has forwarded its findings to the Litigation Chamber, and action will be taken in early 2021. </p>



<p>Dr Jef Ausloos, of University of Amsterdam, a complaint, said </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“I am happy to see a data protection authority resolve to take on the tracking industry. This may be the first step in taking down surveillance capitalism”. </em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Who is involved in the RTB campaign?</strong></p>



<p>There are 22 RTB complainants, individuals and organisations, in 16 EU Member States. They are Dr Johnny Ryan, Senior Fellow of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties; Jim Killock Executive Director of the Open Rights Group; Dr Michael Veale of the Turing Institute; Katarzyna Szymielewicz, CEO of the Panoptykon Foundation; Evelyn Austin, Director of Bits of Freedom; Gemma Galdon Clavell, CEO of the Eticas Foundation; Jose Belo; Dr Jef Ausloos of the University of Amsterdam; Pierre Dewitte of the University of Leuven; Liberties.eu; the Society for Civil Rights; Digitale courage; Ligue des droits humains; Digitale Gesellschaft; Netzwerk Datenschutzexpertise; Deutsche Vereinigung für Datenschutz; the Italian Coalition for Civil Rights and Freedoms; the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee; the Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Romania; the Italian Coalition for Civil Rights and Freedoms; the Estonian Human Rights Centre; the Peace Institute.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October, 2020, Hugo Xu (a.k.a. "jspenguin2017") <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362">announced</a> he had sold Nano to "a team of Turkish developers". No further information was posted.</p>
<p>This immediately aroused suspicion. Who <em>are</em> these "Turkish developers"? Who controls the code? Why has the Privacy Policy been removed?</p>
<p>Fast forward 12 days later, Raymond Hill (developer of uBlock Origin) started to <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362#issuecomment-709428210">dig deeper</a>. Raymond inspected the modifications added by the new developers (which was not published to GitHub), revealing their dubious intentions.</p>
<p>The extension transmits your data to an <a href="https://def.dev-nano.com/">unknown server</a>, sending information about web requests (which may contain confidential information). This is a backdoor, and presents a <em>major</em> privacy risk to users of the Nano suite.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after, these same "Turkish developers" published a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nano-dev">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Despite working <em>without</em> collecting data, the new Nano developers have chosen to collect the following data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your IP Address,</li>
<li>Your Country,</li>
<li>URL's,</li>
<li>Time of your web requests,</li>
<li>HTTP Methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">(POST, GET, HEAD, etc.)</a></li>
<li>Size of HTTP Responses,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Response_codes">(HTTP Status Response Codes)</a></li>
<li>Your Operating System and "other parameters about the device operating system and/or the User's IT environment",</li>
<li>Time spent on each web page,</li>
<li>URL's navigated in the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that's not enough, the new developers have not released an official statement.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, what can you do? Remove this extension <strong>immediately!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation">uBlock Origin</a> is a fine alternative to Nano.</p>
<p>It comes with greater stability, many more contributors, and no data collection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember to audit your extensions frequently, and remove any unused extensions.</p>
<p>In the case of Nano Defender, users were not notified before control of the extension was transferred to a third-party. That's not the right way to handle this.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we can learn from this and move forward.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I've just been told that LiCybora, the author of the Firefox Nano extensions, has full control over the Firefox extensions. <a href="https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoDefenderFirefox/issues/187">They're safe for now.</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>It’s been 13 years since Yudkowsky published the sequences, and 11 years since he wrote “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning">Rationality is Systematized Winning</a>“.</p>
<p>So where are all the winners?</p>
<p>The people that jump to mind are Nick Bostrom (Oxford Professor of Philosophy, author), Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld (run OpenPhil and GiveWell, directing ~300M in annual donations) and Will MacAskill (Oxford Professor of Philosophy, author).</p>
<p>But somehow that feels like cheating. We know rationalism is a good meme, so it doesn’t seem fair to cite people whose accomplishments are largely built off of convincing someone else that rationalism is important. They’re successful, but at a meta-level, only in the same way Steve Bannon is successful, and to a much lesser extent.</p>
<p>By comparison, Miyamoto Musashi, who Yudkowsky quotes extensively in the post, and who coined the phrase “the Ichi school is the spirit of winning”, appears to have been one of the greatest swordsmen of his era. According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi#First_duel">Wikipedia</a>, he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fought duels against the most famous schools in Kyoto, and never lost</li>
<li>Defeated an “adept” at age 13</li>
<li>Was granted the title “Unrivaled Under Heaven” by the shogun at 21</li>
<li>Single handedly ended the Yoshioka School by defeating 3 masters, and then a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshioka-ry%C5%AB">70 person ambush</a> of followers</li>
</ul>
<p>One explanation is that rationalism entails a particular value system that guides rationalists away from becoming prominent politicians or entrepreneurs. This isn’t obviously absurd. Very successful people are often described as ambitious, smart and hardworking, but rarely as intellectually honest. Analogously, Ecclesiastical orders often had the highest literacy rates, but had philosophical objections to using that leverage to gain influence in other spheres.</p>
<p>Except that they totally did anyway. Pope Urban II initiated the crusades, a holy war of massive proportions. Pope Clement VII was so influential that King Henry VIII had to leave the church and invent in Anglicanism just to escape. And Pope Innocent III claimed influence over all the kings of Europe, single handedly annulled the Magna Carta, and in an act of nominative anti-determinism, directed the sack of Constantiple.</p>
<p>Even today, churches are enormously powerful and wealthy. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#:~:text=After%20the%20Time%20article%20was,at%20%2425%20to%20%2430%20billion.">LDS</a> has an estimated $5B in annual revenue, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mormon-church-amassed-100-billion-it-was-the-best-kept-secret-in-the-investment-world-11581138011">an estimated $100B</a> in funds, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_affiliations_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#:~:text=Almost%20all%20of%20the%20presidents,Presbyterians%20being%20the%20most%20prevalent.">protestants can make claims to nearly every US president</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you think rationalism is genuinely rooted in altruism, they strongly recommend “earning to give”, which ought to result in rationalists leading hedge funds, startups and so on.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen once <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15122162/tyler-cowen-ezra-klein-interview-podcast">called rationalism</a> “just another kind of religion”, but if so, it seems to be a fairly unsuccessful one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Still, no one can deny that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/">they have noticed the skulls</a>. Whatever criticism one makes of rationalists, they have likely made of themselves many times over.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Systematised Winning, Scott Alexander wrote <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LgavAYtzFQZKg95WC/extreme-rationality-it-s-not-that-great">Extreme Rationality: It’s Not That Great</a> claiming that there is “approximately zero empirical evidence that x-rationality has a large effect on your practical success”, and giving several possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness of will: Even with good ideas, rationalists can’t execute</li>
<li>Specific knowledge beats out generalized theoretical knowledge</li>
<li>Noise</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is particularly interesting, Scott goes on to say that “people in finance tend to know this and use specially developed x-rationalist techniques on the job already without making it a lifestyle commitment.” In addition to specialization, practitioners have the benefit of learning a system of practice built by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html">tradition smarter than you</a>. A person can compete against their own irrational self, but they shouldn’t expect to win against a centuries old practice.</p>
<p>What about dynamic fields, or new fields without precedent?</p>
<p>Many startup CEOs are young generalists who did not learn their craft through a career at McKinsey or an MBA program at Harvard. It’s not clear that tech entrepreneurship has a storied tradition of practice, aside from maybe the abundance of podcasts free to all.</p>
<p>A better excuse is that startup founders are just totally insane, in a way that precludes any rational or even rationalist person from joining their ranks. Elon Musk famously compared entrepreneurship to “chewing glass and staring into the abyss”; Paul Graham warned “If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine”.</p>
<p>That’s the best case scenario where things go according to plan. The much more likely outcome is that you stagnate for years, raise money from, hire or alienate all your friends, are resented by every employee you sold on a billion dollar exit, who by the way, are the only people you ever see, all while sacrificing your physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>This should also be considered against a very high baseline quality of life. The alternative to running a tech company isn’t the median human existence, it’s being an incredibly well paid engineer or tech executive and retiring in your 30s.</p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of baselines, what exactly should we expect from the rationalist community?</p>
<p>If it was a bunch of uneducated basement dwellers, we shouldn’t be shocked to learn that rationalism was unable to transform them into heads of state and captains of industry.</p>
<p>But the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/2019%20SSC%20Survey.html">SCC survey results</a> paint a different picture. Over 40% of readers work in software engineering, IT, and computer science, with another 4.7% in finance and 3% in physics, 6.7% in engineering, and 3.8% in law. 12% have PhDs, another 25% have Master’s degrees, and another 40% have Bachelor’s.</p>
<p>All else equal, we should expect these people to do fairly well, or at least have the potential to once imbued with some kind of cognitive superpower.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two possible conspiratorial views:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The world is run by rationalists, but you haven’t heard of them. From an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/15/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-years-in-an-alternate-universe/">earlier SSC post</a>:&nbsp; “large organizations tend to have a position that pretty much controls everything from behind the scenes but doesn’t have to cope with the appearance of power”</p>
</li>
<li><p>The world is run by rationalists, but they haven’t outed themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As with all conspiracies, these views are not only crazy, but also unfalsifiable. I could just as easily claim that the world is secretly run by freemasons. From a Bayesian perspective, the evidence is equally well explained by the both hypotheses, so we should stick with our prior that there is not a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Instead, I propose the weak conspiracy, which is that many successful people have read rationalist blogs, but do not make it part of their identity. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyler Cowen: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15122162/tyler-cowen-ezra-klein-interview-podcast">I enjoy all those sources, and I read them. That’s obviously a kind of endorsement.</a>“</li>
<li>Paul Graham: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/909070952465600512">There’s no one writing now that I admire more than Scott Alexander</a>“</li>
<li>Matt Levine: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/795743276036923392">Does anyone else think about this [SSC] article every day?</a>“</li>
<li>Patrick Collison: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1005903040115814400">…Scott Alexander’s deservedly famous Meditations on Moloch</a>“</li>
<li>Steven Pinker: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1275406500492697601?lang=en">Tragedy in the blogosphere: One of the best [SSC] is being taken down.</a>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, now the question is: “do rationalists become successful, or do successful people just like blogs on the internet?” We might try to infer causality from timing. As of 2009, every one of those people was already successful, which points in favor of the latter hypothesis.</p>
<hr>
<p>Instead of more theorizing, I’ll end by offering my own testimony.</p>
<p>The primary impacts of reading rationalist blogs are that 1) I have been frequently distracted at work, and 2) my conversations have gotten much worse. Talking to non-rationalists, I am perpetually holding myself back from saying “oh yes, that’s just the thing where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/01/is-it-possible-to-have-coherent-principles-around-free-speech-norms/">no one has coherent</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">meta-principles</a>“ or “that’s the thing where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://meaningness.com/eggplant/refrigerator">facts are purpose-dependent</a>“. Talking to rationalists is not much better, since it feels less like a free exchange of ideas, and more like an exchange of “have you read <x> post?”</x></p>
<p>There are some specific areas where rationality might help, like using Yudkowsky’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> to know when it’s plausible to think I have an original insight that is not already “priced into the market”, but even here, I’m not convinced these beat out specific knowledge. If you want to start a defensible monopoly, reading about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2018/07/29/mind-the-moat-a-7-powers-review/">business strategy</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup">startup-specific strategy</a> will probably be more useful than trying to reason about “efficiency” in a totally abstract sense.</p>
<p>And yet, I will continue reading these blogs, and if Slate Star Codex ever releases a new post, I will likely drop whatever I am doing to read it. This has nothing to do with self-improvement or “systematized winning”.</p>
<p>It’s solely because weird blogs on the internet make me feel less alone.</p>
<p>Before reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human's_Guide_to_Words">A Human’s Guide to Words</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">The Categories Were Made For Man</a>, I went around thinking “oh god, no one is using language coherently, and I seem to be the only one seeing it, but I cannot even express my horror in a comprehensible way.” This felt like a hellish combination of being trapped in an illusion, questioning my own sanity, and simultaneously being unable to scream. For years, I wondered if I was just uniquely broken, and living in a reality that no one else seemed to see or understand.</p>
<p>So the defense of “rationality as systematized winning” is not even a causal one. I don’t claim to have benefited in any real way from rationality, nor can I really recommend it to anyone who isn’t already inclined to read these blogs. The point of winning is not to make money, or gain influence, or even to altruistically produce more QALYs. The point is that for my reality to even feel legitimate, it needs to have bearing on the consensus shared reality.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that Slate Star Codex is gone, this project feels more necessary than ever. Substack promised to fund independent writing, but instead, has largely replaced eclectic blogs with rapid-fire newsletters that follow the news-cycle. The kinds of people who would have been rationalist writers are instead mass-producing insight-porn on Twitter, or starting Progress Studies blogs to share historical trivia.</p>
<p>A smart person would take this …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After I published my $1 MCU write-up, several readers suggested I look at application processors — the MMU-endowed chips necessary to run real operating systems like Linux. Massive shifts over the last few years have seen internet-connected devices become more featureful (and hopefully, more secure), and I’m finding myself putting Linux into more and more places.</p><p>Among beginner engineers, application processors supplicate reverence: one minor PCB bug and your $10,000 prototype becomes a paperweight. There’s an occult consortium of engineering pros who drop these chips into designs with utter confidence, while the uninitiated cower for their Raspberry Pis and overpriced industrial SOMs.</p><p>This article is targeted at embedded engineers who are familiar with microcontrollers but not with microprocessors or Linux, so I wanted to put together something with a quick primer on why you’d want to run embedded Linux, a broad overview of what’s involved in designing around application processors, and then a dive into some specific parts you should check out — and others you should avoid — for entry-level embedded Linux systems.</p><p>Just like my microcontroller article, the parts I picked range from the well-worn horses that have pulled along products for the better part of this decade, to fresh-faced ICs with intriguing capabilities that you can keep up your sleeve.</p><p>If my mantra for the microcontroller article was that you should pick the right part for the job and not be afraid to learn new software ecosystems, my argument for this post is even simpler: once you’re booted into Linux on basically <em>any</em> of these parts, they become identical development environments.</p><p>That makes chips running embedded Linux almost a commodity product: as long as your processor checks off the right boxes, your application code won’t know if it’s running on an ST or a Microchip part — even if one of those is a brand-new dual-core Cortex-A7 and the other is an old ARM9. Your I2C drivers, your GPIO calls — even your V4L-based image processing code — will all work seamlessly.</p><p>At least, that’s the sales pitch. Getting a part booted is an entirely different ordeal altogether — that’s what we’ll be focused on. Except for some minor benchmarking at the end, once we get to a shell prompt, we’ll consider the job completed.</p><p>As a departure from my microcontroller review, this time I’m focusing heavily on hardware design: unlike the microcontrollers I reviewed, these chips vary considerably in PCB design difficulty — a discussion I would be in error to omit. To this end, I designed a dev board from scratch for each application processor reviewed. Well, actually, <em>many</em> dev boards for each processor: roughly 25 different designs in total. This allowed me to try out different DDR layout and power management strategies — as well as fix some bugs along the way.</p><p>I intentionally designed these boards from scratch rather than starting with someone else’s CAD files. This helped me discover little “gotchas” that each CPU has, as well as optimize the design for cost and hand-assembly. Each of these boards was designed across one or two days’ worth of time and used JLC’s low-cost 4-layer PCB manufacturing service.</p><p>These boards won’t win any awards for power consumption or EMC: to keep things easy, I often cheated by combining power rails together that would typically be powered (and sequenced!) separately. Also, I limited the on-board peripherals to the bare minimum required to boot, so there are no audio CODECs, little I2C sensors, or Ethernet PHYs on these boards.</p><p id="differences">As a result, the boards I built for this review are akin to the notes from your high school history class or a recording you made of yourself practicing a piece of music to study later. So while I’ll post pictures of the boards and screenshots of layouts to illustrate specific points, these aren’t intended to serve as reference designs or anything; the whole point of the review is to get you to a spot where you’ll want to go off and design <em>your own</em> little Linux boards. Teach a person to fish, you know?</p><h2>Microcontroller vs Microprocessor: Differences</h2><p>Coming from microcontrollers, the first thing you’ll notice is that Linux doesn’t usually run on Cortex-M, 8051, AVR, or other popular microcontroller architectures. Instead, we use <em>application processors</em> — popular ones are the Arm Cortex-A, ARM926EJ-S, and several MIPS iterations.</p><p>The biggest difference between these application processors and a microcontroller is quite simple: microprocessors have a memory management unit (MMU), and microcontrollers don’t. Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CClinux">you can run Linux without an MMU</a>, but you usually shouldn’t: Cortex-M7 parts that can barely hit 500 MHz routinely go for double or quadruple the price of faster Cortex-A7s. They’re power-hungry: microcontrollers are built on larger processes than application processors to reduce their leakage current. And without an MMU and generally-low clock speeds, they’re downright slow.</p><p id="why">Other than the MMU, the lines between MCUs and MPUs are getting blurred. Modern application processors often feature a similar peripheral complement as microcontrollers, and high-end Cortex-M7 microcontrollers often have similar clock speeds as entry-level application processors.</p><h2>Why would you want to Linux?</h2><p>When your microcontroller project outgrows its super loop and the random ISRs you’ve sprinkled throughout your code with care, there are many bare-metal tasking kernels to turn to — <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/">FreeRTOS</a>, ThreadX (now <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/rtos/">Azure RTOS</a>), <a href="https://www.rt-thread.io/">RT-Thread</a>, <a href="https://www.micrium.com/rtos/kernels/">μC/OS</a>, etc. By an academic definition, these are operating systems. However, compared to Linux, it’s more useful to think of these as a framework you use to write your bare-metal application inside. They provide the core components of an operating system: threads (and obviously a scheduler), semaphores, message-passing, and events. Some of these also have networking, filesystems, and other libraries.</p><p>Comparing bare-metal RTOSs to Linux simply comes down to the fundamental difference <em>between </em>these and Linux: memory management and protection. This one technical difference makes Linux running on an application processor behave quite differently from your microcontroller running an RTOS.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1');">1</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1">Before the RTOS snobs attack with pitchforks, yes, there are large-scale, well-tested RTOSes that are usually run on application processors with memory management units. Look at <a href="https://www.rtems.org/">RTEMS</a> as an example. They don’t have some of the limitations discussed below, and have many advantages over Linux for safety-critical real-time applications.</span></p><h4>Dynamic memory allocation</h4><p>Small microcontroller applications can usually get by with static allocations for everything, but as your application grows, you’ll find yourself calling malloc() more and more, and that’s when weird bugs will start creeping up in your application. With complex, long-running systems, you’ll notice things working 95% of the time — only to crash at random (and usually inopportune) times. These bugs evade the most javertian developers, and in my experience, they almost always stem from memory allocation issues: usually either memory leaks (that can be fixed with appropriate free() calls), or more serious problems like memory fragmentation (when the allocator runs out of appropriately-sized free blocks).</p><p>Because Linux-capable application processors have a memory management unit, *alloc() calls execute swiftly and reliably. Physical memory is only reserved (<em>faulted in</em>) when you actually access a memory location. Memory fragmentation is much less an issue since Linux frees and reorganizes pages behind the scenes. Plus, switching to Linux provides easier-to-use diagnostic tools (like <a href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a>) to catch bugs in your application code in the first place. And finally, because applications run in virtual memory, if your app <em>does</em> have memory bugs in it, Linux will kill it — leaving the rest of your system running. <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2');">2</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2">As a last-ditch kludge, it’s not uncommon to call your app in a superloop shell script to automatically restart it if it crashes without having to restart the entire system.</span></p><h4>Networking &amp; Interoperability</h4><p>Running something like lwIP under FreeRTOS on a bare-metal microcontroller is acceptable for a lot of simple applications, but application-level network services like HTTP can burden you to implement in a reliable fashion. Stuff that seems simple to a desktop programmer — like a WebSockets server that can accept multiple simultaneous connections — can be tricky to implement in bare-metal network stacks. Because C doesn’t have good programming constructs for asynchronous calls or exceptions, code tends to contain either a lot of weird state machines or tons of nested branches. It’s horrible to debug problems that occur. In Linux, you get a first-class network stack, plus tons of rock-solid userspace libraries that sit on top of that stack and provide application-level network connectivity. Plus, you can use a variety of high-level programming languages that are easier to handle the asynchronous nature of networking.</p><p>Somewhat related is the rest of the standards-based communication / interface frameworks built into the kernel. I2S, parallel camera interfaces, RGB LCDs, SDIO, and basically all those other scary high-bandwidth interfaces seem to come together much faster when you’re in Linux. But the big one is USB host capabilities. On Linux, USB devices <em>just work</em>. If your touchscreen drivers are glitching out and you have a client demo to show off in a half-hour, just plug in a USB mouse until you can fix it (I’ve been there before). Product requirements change and now you need audio? Grab a $20 USB dongle until you can respin the board with a proper audio codec. On many boards without Ethernet, I just use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter to allow remote file transfer and GDB debugging. Don’t forget that, at the end of the day, an embedded Linux system is shockingly similar to your computer.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>When thinking about embedded device security, there are usually two things we’re talking about: device …</p></div></div></div>

					        			<p>Posted by Paul on January 29, 2017</p>		
        		</div><div>
        			<p><strong>Back in 2007 I was very excited to start reading <em>The Singularity is Near</em> by Ray Kurzweil which had been published 2 years earlier in 2005. As someone who'd always been fascinated by computers and technology since I started programming my first ZX Spectrum as a child, through to my teenage years programming in QBASIC, to my work as a Web Developer, I was well aware of Moore's law and very conscious of the accelerating progress in technology.</strong></p>
<p>As I started to read, it became clear that this was an exceptional book. The clarity of Kurzweil's writing, the level of detail he went in to about each concept he discussed and the content itself were entirely captivating, not least because the predictions were set to happen in the near future and would change the world in to an unrecognisable utopia. In fact, although Kurzweil says early on in the book that his view of the future is neither utopian nor dystopian, the future described is so rosy that the Singularity has also been called "the Geeks' Rapture".</p>
<p>Indeed, if Kurzweil's predictions do come true, they are comparible in their size and implications to the Second Coming of Jesus - the conquering of death and the unification of all consciousness in to one computational substrate that is to become more powerful than anything in the Universe and spreads outward from the Earth at the speed of light ... or faster!</p>
<p>The book quickly became an absolute page-turner for me and as incredulous as it sounded, Kurzweil backed up every prediction with thorough research, logic, and his own impressive credentials - Kurzweil was something of a child prodigy who programmed computers and wrote scientific papers at an early age and became the inventor of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and the Kurzweil digital pianos and keyboards that bear his name. Kurzweil now works at Google where his job description is "to bring natural language understanding to Google" - a goal not too distant from developing an AI capable of passing the Turing test.</p>
<p>During my time as a software developer, discussions often arose about the future of technology and I would occasionally lend the book to other developers. Unfortunately, at some point the book wasn't returned and I wasn't too fussed as I'd already read it thoroughly. Recently, I decided to buy another copy and re-read it - after all, I still consider it to be one of the best books I've ever read. This time though, 12 years after the initial publication, it would be possible to see how Kurzweil's predictions had done.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Kurzweil himself has released a document describing how his predictions are faring which can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately though, he doesn't always seem to be intellectually honest with himself:</p>
<div><p>"PREDICTION<br>Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas.</p><p>ACCURACY <br>Essentially correct</p></div>
<p>In The Singularity is Near, the wording could be interpreted to mean that it is commonly <br>used, which is not yet the case, but this is likely to become the case over the next couple <br>of years."</p>
<p>Well that was 2010, it's now 2017 - where are these eyeglasses and contact lenses? What about Google Glass? Well it may still be being developed, but it certainly isn't in common use. Kurzweil also tends to mark many of his other predictions as "correct", when really they're not, even now in 2017.</p>
<p>So, let's get on to my re-reading of <em>The Singularity is Near</em>, which even for the second time I thoroughly enjoyed and took away a load more fascinating information that I may have missed on the first reading. This time I noted any predictions as I went through that we can now verify and what I found is below.</p>
<h2>On pages 11 and 12 we have:</h2>
<p>"James Watson, the codiscoverer of DNA, said that in fifty years we will have drugs that will allow us to eat as much as we want without gaining weight.<br>I replied, 'Fifty years?' We have accomplished this already in mice by blocking the fat insulin receptor gene that controls the storage of fat in the fat cells. Drugs for human use ... are in development now and will be in FDA tests in several years. These will be available in five to ten years, not fifty."</p>
<p>Well, <em>The Singularity is Near</em> was published in 2005, so Kurzweil's deadline for this was 2015. According to the NHS website however, 1,316 gastrc band operations were performed in 2012 and today we still don't have a pill that you can take and then eat what you want. It would be unfair of me not to mention an article on Kurzweil's site: <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/imaginary-meal-tricks-the-body-into-losing-weight" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/imaginary-meal-tricks-the-body-into-losing-weight</a> but this has only been tested in mice which Kurzweil even says on p11 had already been achieved. I'm sure Kurzweil would disagree, but if we're being honest, there is still no magic pill available that lets us eat what we want and not gain weight.</p>
<p>Prediction: False</p>
<h2>Page 105</h2>
<p>"By the end of this decade, computers will disappear as distinct physical objects, with displays built in our eyeglasses, and electronics woven in our clothing, providing full-immersion visual virtual reality. Thus, 'going to a Web site' will mean entering a virtual-reality environment - at least for the visual and auditory senses - where we can directly interact with products and people, both real and simulated. Although simulated people will not be up to human standards - at least not by 2009 - they will be quite satisfactory as sales agents, reservation clerks, and research assistants. Haptic (tactile) interfaces will enable us to touch products and people. It is difficult to identify any lasting advantage of the old brick-and-mortar world that will not ultimately be overcome by the rich interactive interfaces that are soon to come."</p>
<p>Did the above sound anything like your experience of 2009? Because it doesn't seem anything like my experience of 2017. There are a few separate claims here, let's break them down:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Computers will disappear in to clothes and eyeglasses."<br>Nope. Computers have become our smart phones though and we're no longer tied to desktops.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Going to a website will mean entering virtual reality."<br>In 2009, no. In 2017, it is possible that a tiny percentage (and we're talking &lt; 0.0001%) of websites use VR and probably a similar percentage of people have an Oculus, Vive, Google Cardboard, Gear VR or similar VR headset. There is a framework to allow developers to make VR websites called <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> but it's definitely not in common use yet.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Virtual assistants will be satisfactory sales agents."<br>Nope, not in 2009 and not now in 2017. The closest we get is a live chat that is a bot, but as soon as the user realises they're not speaking to a real person, and that is pretty much after the very first question, they would usually rather just use a search or browse an FAQ.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Touch interfaces will allow us to touch products and people."<br>Sure this has existed in labs for a long time, but do we use this even in 2017? Nope, not even close. Yet another fail for Kurzweil, if we're honest.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Page 312</h2>
<p>"Computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment. They will tap into the worldwide mesh (what the World Wide Web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating Web servers, thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks) of high-speed communications and computational resources. We'll have very high-bandwidth, wireless communication to the Internet at all times. Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas."</p>
<ul>
<li>"Computers in clothing, furniture and the environment."<br>Well I have a Christmas jumper with flashing LEDs but I don't think that's what Kurzweil meant, and none of my furniture has a computer in it unless you count the Raspberry Pi on the shelf of my coffee table. As above, this one doesn't seem correct even in 2017. <p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"A worldwide mesh will link all devices"<br>Many devices do connect to wifi and you can connect to their IP address to access a config page served by their web server, so this seems to be correct. <p>Prediction: True</p></li>
<li>"forming vast supercomputers and memory banks"<br>In the PDF linked to above, Kurzweil tries to claim he meant the Cloud, but actually I think it's clear from the text that he meant all devices that connect to the Internet will share their resources in terms of memory and processing power. While this probably will happen fairly soon in my opinion and I run the "<a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding @ Home</a>" software which donates spare processor time to scientists who are trying to solve cancer and Alzheimer's, and can run on a mobile device, this isn't in common use yet in 2017.<p>Prediction: False</p><p>[Update 2017-12-22]<br>Rather than a single standard for devices to share their computing resources, it might be that blockchain technology allows these resources to be shared safely and anonymously in return for a reward such as cash, cryptocurrency or the use of other resources. Some technologies now exist that share processing such as <a href="https://golem.network/" target="_blank">Golem</a> and storage such as <a href="https://sia.tech/" target="_blank">Sia</a>. If these became ubiquitous and ran on the majority of devices, the amount of computing power available would probably be many orders of magnitude greater than even the most powerful supercomputers in existence today. </p></li>
<li>"We'll have very high-bandwidth, wireless communication to the Internet at all times."<br>Correct! Indeed we do, and we use it so much that it's hard to remember that in 2005, we didn't have this.<p>Prediction: True</p></li>
<li>"Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas."<br>Also discussed above, this one seems way off.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Still talking about "The 2010 Scenario", Kurzweil continues on page 313:</h2>
<p>"These resources will …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Elroy is a table lamp with a unique feature — the shade can dynamically change, at the swipe of a finger, to a new style or pattern to complement your mood, the time of day, or an event, all from your phone or web browser.</span></p>
<p><span>Elroy is a concept and personal DIY project. I’ll share some learnings and details on how I built it. These aren’t step-by-step instructions, but I hope they’ll be helpful to anyone that’s inspired to build their own design.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/elroy-lamp-4c_moment-5/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><span>Elroy is essentially a computer with a 4-way display, backlit by a bright LED bulb. The four sides of the lamp shade are made from translucent LCD displays, and acrylic and paper diffusion layers. The light source is a very bright 35W LED bulb. The displays are driven by a single board computer running Linux and custom software to display and manage images. The lamp is controllable over wifi via a simple web app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Translucent LCDs</strong></h3>
<p><span>I salvaged some 13” LCD displays from old laptops and found additional matching displays on ebay. I disassembled each display, removing the frame, backing layer, diffusion film, and backlight. This took some practice to get right. The LCD glass is quite fragile. I broke 2 panels during disassembly and had to find replacements. The trick is to remove the electrical tape that holds the display together without flexing the LCD glass so much that it cracks.</span></p>

From top: 1) A shiny white paper layer to reflect the back light 2) a transparent polycarbonate sheet with a film to scatter the back light 3) a stack of different diffusion films 4) metal frame 5) the LCD glass panel with circuit board.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-711"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-711">The backlight is a row of super bright LEDs tucked into a channel in the metal frame. Some other LCD panels use a cold florescent tube instead of LEDs.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The remaining LCD panel is translucent: LCD displays are a sandwich of transparent glass embedded with liquid crystals and tiny transistors, surrounded by layers of polarizing film. In the photo below, I wrote a message on a piece of letter paper, placed it on a clear piece of acrylic, on top of a bright backlight. You can see the LCD display on the right is translucent, but similar to a pair of sunglasses, the polarizing film only permits a fraction of the backlight to emit through the panel.</span></p>

<p><span>Polarizing film is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"><span>necessary for the function of an LCD display</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lamp Light &amp; Diffusion</strong></h3>
<p><span>Given the low amount of light emitted through the display, to create a sufficiently bright lamp, a very bright light source is needed. Also, though an LCD display is typically backlit by a light with a cold color temperature (around 5000K), lamp light is typically a warm color temperature (like 2700K). So the ideal bulb must be bright and warm.</span></p>

<p><span>I experimented with multi-bulb arrays, and different bulb options, but settled on this 35W (300W equiv) LED bulb. This bulb is giant and takes up quite a bit of space within the shade. It’s bright enough that it shouldn’t be directly exposed — it would be uncomfortable (maybe dangerous?) to look at directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, without some work, the light from the bulb, when viewed through the LCD panels, would be a harsh point-light concentrated in the center. </span><span>I wanted to diffuse the light evenly across the surface and produce a textured, fabric-like aesthetic. I experimented with different acrylic and polycarbonate sheets and paper materials.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s one experiment result I really liked, but didn’t end up using. This is mulberry paper, which has a unique texture that’s simultaneously woody and linen-like, has nice diffusion properties, and transmits a lot of light. This looked great with black and white patterns and particularly complemented a Japanese lantern aesthetic. I felt like the large and non-uniform fibers didn’t work as well with a diverse set of patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>I found the best combination was this sandwich (starting from the inside):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Frosted acrylic 1/8″ 90% emission (film facing out)</span></li>
<li><span>Vellum tracing paper</span></li>
<li><span>LCD</span></li>
<li><span>Rice paper</span></li>
<li><span>Clear anti-glare polycarbonate 3/32”</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>The acrylic and polycarbonate sheets also add some structure to protect the LCD glass from flexing and breaking. I wrapped the edges of each sandwich in acetate cloth electrical tape to keep the sheets together.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Controlling</strong></h3>
<p><span>I needed a small SBC (single-board computer), capable of driving 4 displays. I happened to have an Nvidia Jetson Nano, which has DisplayPort 1.2 output with support for MST (multi-stream transport), which means it’s able to drive multiple displays. The Jetson Nano is a powerful, tiny computer that operates on 5V power and can run a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.</span></p>

<p><span>I wrote some custom software based on </span><a href="https://www.pygame.org/"><span>Pygame</span></a><span> to display images, with a simple web app and server to give me control over the images.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="409" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg 294w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-768x785.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-1002x1024.jpg 1002w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p><span>The LCD panels take EDP (Embedded DisplayPort) video input. Each display required an adapter from DisplayPort to EDP. These adapters are bulky and have a lot of functionality I didn’t actually need, like 12V power and brightness control for a backlight (which I removed from each panel) and a control interface for display settings. I also needed an MST Hub to break out 4 DP ports from the 1 DP port on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. This configuration is something I think I could make cheaper and more compact in a future revision, but it worked great for this concept.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Woodwork</strong></h3>
<p><span>I designed the lamp structure in Rhino3D and chose to make wooden parts from walnut. This makes the shade rather heavy, but the lamp is stable with the walnut base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692"><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/img_20190608_172549/" rel="attachment wp-att-692"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-692">The shade frame, glued-up, sanded, and ready to stain.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>I cut all parts for the shade and base, then shaped them on a router table. I’m not an experienced woodworker, but this came together pretty easily. I had an adventure making tongue-and-groove joints for the first time. This is the 3rd time I’ve used walnut for a project and I always like the result.</span></p>
<p><span>The side-edges of the frame have brass threaded inserts that enable the top and bottom to attach via M2 machine screws.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3D Printed Parts</strong></h3>
<p><span>Most of the electronic components, including the power supply, SBC, MST Hub, switches, and wiring are mounted in a 4.5” square 3D printed “sleeve” that fits inside the walnut base. There is also a vented platform that connects the sleeve to the bottom of the shade.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_696" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-696"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-1024x780.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="400" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-1024x780.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-768x585.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform.jpg 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-696">Drawing of sleeve and vented platform.

<figure id="attachment_716" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-716"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-716">The sleeve, ready to insert into the walnut base. I primed and painted the 3D printed sleeve. Only the top 2 inches is visible when the lamp is assembled, so the rough spots here aren’t a problem.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>If I were building this lamp for production … or if I had access to the right tools, I’d want to make the sleeve and platform out of sheet metal to improve heat dissipation.</span></p>
<p><span>On top of the shade, I added a louvered cover. This enables the shade to emit additional light from the top, while obscuring the bulb, which is too bright to look at directly. This also permits heat to escape. I printed these parts out of translucent PETG, which has a higher plasticization temperature than some other common 3D printing filament materials. This isn’t strictly necessary because the surface temperature of the bulb doesn’t really get that hot. Even after hours of continuous use, the temperate is &lt;130 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Making it better</strong></h3>
<p><span>This lamp is mostly a proof of concept, but it works and looks good enough that I plan to keep it and use it. If I make another, I have a few ideas for improvement.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sheet metal. Replace the 3D printed sleeve and vented platform with sheet metal to help dissipate heat.</span></li>
<li><span>Replace the DisplayPort MST hub and adapters. These take up a lot of space and add significant expense (~$250 for the hub and 4 adapters). One theoretical alternative is a DisplayLink adapter based on the </span><a href="https://www.displaylink.com/integrated-chipsets/dl-4000"><span>DL-4100</span></a><span>, which would drive displays over USB and support EDP. I haven’t been able to find such a device on the market yet. Another option to drive displays from USB3 would be to use an SBC with Displayport Alt Mode. I would still need to adapt Displayport to eDP. Adapter boards that do this are bulky and have a lot of components because they provide power and control to the backlight. Since I’m not using a backlight, I could make a simpler adapter that just maps pins for the different connectors.</span></li>
<li><span>Finally, reconsider the closed frame design. Elroy’s shade is basically a closed box. I made this choice&nbsp; to obscure the bulb and hide some electronic components like the EDP ribbon cables and adapters. An open frame design might be possible. One idea is to backlight the panels with edge lighting so I can reduce or eliminate the high wattage bulb.</span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This week, we close out our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, although I ought to note that there will be at least one addendum discussing pre-modern cast iron and crucible steel (Wootz) production.  Last week, we looked at the processes used to create steel from iron by introducing carbon (rather than the modern method of producing steel from pig iron by <em>removing</em> carbon).  That process changes the characteristics of the metal, since steel is harder and more elastic (bending and springing back, rather than bending and staying bent) than iron.</p>



<p>But the chemical composition of the iron or steel isn’t the only factor in determining its hardness and ductility: mechanical processes and heat treatment also alter the internal structure of the metal.  Since the pre-modern blacksmith works with both of these – mechanical processes through hammer and heat through the ‘heats’ of forging – he cannot afford to disregard the changes that both bring.  As we noted in part III, the blacksmith’s job is not merely to bring the metal into the necessary <em>shape</em> for its final application, he also has to get it there with the right <em>characteristics</em> – the correct balance of hardness, strength, ductility and elasticity to get the job done, whatever that job might be.</p>



<p>And I should note again that different tools – and indeed, different parts of the same tool – might have very different demands in this regard.  Metal files needed to be prodigiously hard so that they could abrade already quite hard materials.  The tips of chisels and picks also needed to be very hard, to keep their shape under repeated impacts, but not so hard that they broke; some ductility to absorb the energy of impact was needed.  Armor needed typically to only be somewhat hardened (though demands of this sort get higher with gunpowder) and can be fairly malleable; the armor plate that deforms elastically on impact still absorbs the strike.  Swords made varied demands: their significant length demanded strong steel with good elasticity to be able to spring back into proper shape after absorbing the forces of swings and impacts, while keeping a good cutting edge demanded a high degree of hardness (hardness being the characteristic that determines how sharp an edge can be and also how well that sharpness can be held during use).</p>



<p>So a blacksmith couldn’t simply maximize one trait at the expense of the others. Nor could they have just one kind of steel, with just one set of characteristics for every application.  Rather the learned techniques – copied and practiced during their apprenticeship – were developed, probably over generations, by experimentation to produce tools, weapons and armor each with its own unique ‘right blend’ of characteristics, though two major methods we will discuss today (along with, of course, carbon content, which we discussed last week).</p>

<h2>Work Hardening</h2>



<p><strong>Work hardening</strong> refers to the tendency of metals, when hammered (or strained into any kind of plastic deformation) to become harder.  In its pristine state, the atoms of a metal are generally arranged in a crystal structure, joined by metallic bonds.  These lattices of atoms are neat and regular.  When that neat, regular lattice of atoms is strained, resulting in plastic (rather than elastic) deformation, those neat regular lattices get scrunched and bent and otherwise dislocated.  This happens in iron, but also in most metals – indeed, work hardening is <em>much more</em> important in bronze-work than it is in iron-work, though it cannot be neglected in either.</p>



<p>That dislocation makes the metal resistant to further deformation (plastic <em>or</em> elastic), both increasing the hardness of the metal and its yield strength (the amount of energy you need to apply for plastic, rather than elastic deformation to take place), but at the same time makes the metal less malleable and more brittle (that is, more likely to break than bend).  This is a property that must have been apparent to the earliest copper-smiths: as they hammered their copper into shape, each blow made the metal slightly more resistant to hammering, until eventually it would refuse to budge almost completely (and possibly break instead).  But the same process works for iron, though because of the different production process for iron, it has to be a touch more intentional.</p>



<p>It is possible to reset this process through a process called <strong>annealing</strong>.  When a work hardened metal is heated up, the energy provided by the heat allows the atoms to break and reform their bonds, causing the crystal structure to return to its normal lattice and removing the various dislocations (while retaining its new shape).  To completely anneal iron, it is heated up to its annealing temperature (which varies based on the carbon content, as you can see in the chart below) and held there for an extended period, which will cause it to get a soft as possible for the given iron and carbon content.  This can be very handy if the iron needs to be cold worked (see below).</p>

<p>If the iron is not held at the high temperature, but is allowed to cool slowly in the air, it is said to be <em>normalized</em> (this process, <em><strong>normalization</strong></em>, is a subset of annealing).  As with full annealing, the heating process works out all of the little strains in metal (heats for this process range from 700 to 900°C), but by cooling it slowly afterwards (rather than holding it at a high temperature), it causes the actual size of the atomic lattice of the metal to shrink (the technical term is ‘grain refinement’ as the individual grains of the lattice are ‘refined’ – meaning ‘get smaller’), which results in a metal <em>somewhat</em> harder than in a fully annealed state.  Normalization is an important step for metal that is going to be subsequently heat treated as well.</p>



<p>Now the attentive reader will be thinking, “but wait, if heating the metal up to forging heat and letting it cool in the air resets the work hardening process – well, we’re doing that every time we heat the metal for forging.”  Indeed!  <strong>Hot</strong> <strong>working </strong>(which is what we’ve been describing so far with forging) generally does not meaningfully work harden metal for this very reason.  And for a smith working with good steel that is going to be <em>heat treated</em> (which we’ll discuss in a minute) this doesn’t matter a whole lot.  </p>



<p>But – for reasons which we’ll discuss – iron with very low carbon contents <em>cannot</em> be heat treated for hardness.  <strong>For a smith working with nearly pure (no carbon) iron, work hardening is his best option for increasing hardness and yield strength.</strong>  In this case, the iron object would typically be brought essentially to its final shape and then finished by being hammered <em>cold</em> (‘<strong>cold working</strong>‘).  While copper and bronze are generally soft enough to be almost entirely cold worked, iron really isn’t, except in fairly thin sheets, so the bulk of the actual <em>shaping</em> will still be done with hot forging, but with a final phase of cold hammering which will induce work hardening (and also, incidentally, can remove tool marks from the hot working, which might be cosmetically desirable).</p>



<h2>Heat Treatment Basics</h2>



<p>The changes steel undergoes when it is heated and cools can also alter its characteristics.  Because, as we’ll see, a big part of the effect of heat treatment has to do with the carbon atoms diffused within the crystalline iron structure of steel, pure iron and low carbon steel cannot be effectively heat treated and has to instead be work hardened in order to achieve similar results.  Heat treatment allows the blacksmith fairly fine control over the hardness, strength and ductility of the steel and can even allow for different parts of a single steel object to be hardened to different degrees.</p>



<p>For high-carbon steel, the heat treatment cycle is often called ‘tempering and quenching’ although as we’ll see it would perhaps be more accurate to call the process <em><strong>hardening, quenching and tempering</strong></em> (and then quenching one more time) to get the correct order.  It is something of an irony that first, intense <em>quenching</em> of raw, red-hot steel (the second quenching is much less dramatic as it occurs at much lower temperatures) – almost always shown as the <em>final</em> step in blacksmithing in film or video games – is essentially never the final step, for reasons that will soon become apparent.</p>



<p>First, some complicated metallurgy and then we’ll get to the actual real world processes a blacksmith would use.  High carbon steel is initially a mix of two kinds of iron, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_iron"><strong>ferrite</strong> </a>and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite">cementite</a></strong>, the former being a cubic atomic structure of pure iron, whereas the later is an iron-carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C for the curious).  If that steel is heated above 912°C (but not melted), something interesting starts to happen: the ferrite structure changes into <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenite">austenite</a></strong>.  Avoiding the deep weeds of metallurgy here, all we need to know is that austenite is a <em>different</em> cube of iron that is able to absorb carbon atoms, pulling them out of the cementite and trapping them inside the individual austentite structures.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language select-able on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>There have been three versions of UNIX. The earliest version (circa 1969–70) ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers. The second version ran on the unprotected PDP-11/20 computer. This paper describes only the PDP-11/40 and /45 [l] system since it is more modern and many of the differences between it and older UNIX systems result from redesign of features found to be deficient or lacking.</p>

<p>Since PDP-11 UNIX became operational in February 1971, about 40 installations have been put into service; they are generally smaller than the system described here. Most of them are engaged in applications such as the preparation and formatting of patent applications and other textual material, the collection and processing of trouble data from various switching machines within the Bell System, and recording and checking telephone service orders. Our own installation is used mainly for research in operating systems, languages, computer networks, and other topics in computer science, and also for document preparation.</p>

<p>Perhaps <mark>the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort</mark>: UNIX can run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and less than two man years were spent on the main system software. Yet UNIX contains a number of features seldom offered even in much larger systems. <mark>It is hoped, however, the users of UNIX will find that the most important characteristics of the system are its simplicity, elegance, and ease of use.</mark></p>

<p>Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED[2], linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL[3] with types and structures (C), interpreter for a dialect of BASIC, text formatting program, Fortran compiler, Snobol interpreter, top-down compiler-compiler (TMG) [4], bottom-up compiler-compiler (YACC), form letter generator, macro processor (M6) [5], and permuted index program.</p>

<p>There is also a host of maintenance, utility, recreation, and novelty programs. All of these programs were written locally. It is worth noting that the system is totally self-supporting. All UNIX software is maintained under UNIX; likewise, UNIX documents are generated and formatted by the UNIX editor and text formatting program.</p>

<h2 id="2-hardware-and-software-environment">2. Hardware and Software Environment</h2>

<p>The PDP-11/45 on which our UNIX installation is implemented is a 16-bit word (8-bit byte) computer with 144 Kbytes of core memory; UNIX occupies 42K bytes. This system, however, includes a very large number of device drivers and enjoys a generous allotment of space for I/O buffers and system tables; a minimal system capable of running the software mentioned above can require as little as 50K bytes of core altogether.</p>

<p>The PDP-11 has a 1M byte fixed-head disk, used for filesystem storage and swapping, four moving-head disk drives which each provide 2.5M bytes on removable disk cartridges, and a single moving-head disk drive which uses removable 40M byte disk packs. There are also a high-speed paper tape reader-punch, nine-track magnetic tape,and D-tape (a variety of magnetic tape facility in which individual records may be addressed and rewritten). Besides the console typewriter, there are 14 variable-speed communications interfaces attached to 100-series datasets and a 201 dataset interface used primarily for spooling printout to a communal line printer. There are also several one-of-a-kind devices including a Picturephone® interface,a voice response unit, a voice synthesizer, a phototypesetter, a digital switching network, and a satellite PDP-11/20 which generates vectors, curves, and characters on a Tektronix 611 storage-tube display.</p>

<p>The greater part of UNIX software is written in the above-mentioned C language [6]. Early versions of the operating system were written in assembly language, but during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C. The size of the new system is about one third greater than the old. Since the new system is not only much easier to understand and to modify but also includes many functional improvements, including multiprogramming and the ability to share reentrant code among several user programs, we considered this increase in size quite acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-file-system">3. The File System</h2>

<p><span>
 S: Note how the paper considers files important. Unix exposes all the functionality through files.
</span></p>

<p>The most important job of UNIX is to provide a file system. From the point of view of the user, there are three kinds of files: ordinary disk files, directories, and special files</p>

<h3 id="31-ordinary-files">3.1 Ordinary Files</h3>

<p><mark>A file contains whatever information the user places on it, for example symbolic or binary (object) programs. No particular structuring is expected by the system.</mark> Files of text consist simply of a string of characters, with lines demarcated by the new-line character. Binary programs are sequences of words as they will appear in core memory when the program starts executing. A few user programs manipulate files with more structure: the assembler generates and the loader expects an object file in a particular format. However, the structure of files is controlled by the programs which use them, not by the system.</p>

<h3 id="32-directories">3.2 Directories</h3>

<p><mark>Directories provide the mapping between the names of files and the files themselves, and thus induce a structure on the file system as a whole.</mark> Each user has a directory of his own files; he may also create subdirectories to contain groups of files conveniently treated together. A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it cannot be written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system controls the contents of directories. However, anyone with appropriate permission may read a directory just like any other file.</p>

<p>The system maintains several directories for its own use. One of these is the <em>root</em> directory. All files in the system can be found by tracing a path through a chain of directories until the desired file is reached. The starting point for such searches is often the root. Another system directory contains all the programs provided for general use; that is, all the <em>commands</em>. As will be seen however, it is by no means necessary that a program reside in this directory for it to be executed.</p>

<p><span>
 S: This is a succinct description of path system of unix and Linux
</span></p>

<p>Files are named by sequences of 14 or fewer characters. When the name of a file is specified to the system, it may be in the form of a <em>path name</em>, which is a sequence of directory names separated by slashes <code>/</code> and ending in a file name. If the sequence begins with a slash, the search begins in the root directory. The name <code>/alpha/beta/gamma</code> causes the system to search the root for directory <code>alpha</code>, then to search <code>alpha</code> for <code>beta</code>, finally to find <code>gamma</code> in <code>beta</code>. <code>gamma</code> may be an ordinary file, a directory, or a special file. As a limiting case, the name <code>/</code> refers to the root itself.</p>

<p>A path name not starting with <code>/</code> causes the system to begin the search in the user’s current directory. Thus, the name <code>alpha/beta</code> specifies the file named <code>beta</code> in subdirectory <code>alpha</code> of the current directory. The simplest kind of name, for example <code>alpha</code>, refers to a file which itself is found in the current directory. As another limiting case, the null file name refers to the current directory.</p>

<p>The same nondirectory file may appear in several directories under possibly different names. This feature is called <em>linking</em>; a directory entry for a file is sometimes called a link. <mark>UNIX differs from other systems in which linking is permitted in that all links to a file have equal status.</mark> That is, a file does not exist within a particular directory; the directory entry for a file consists merely of its name and a pointer to the information actually describing the file. Thus a file exists independently of any directory entry, although in practice a file is made to disappear along with the last link to it.</p>

<p>Each directory always has at least two entries. The name in each directory refers to the directory itself. Thus a program may read the current directory under the name <code>.</code> without knowing its complete path name. The name <code>..</code> by convention refers to the parent of the directory in which it appears, that is, to the directory in which it was created.</p>

<p><mark>The directory structure is constrained to have the form of a rooted tree.</mark> Except for the special entries <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>, each directory must appear as an entry in exactly one other,which is its parent. Te reason for this is to simplify the writing of programs which visit subtrees of the directory structure, and more important, to avoid the separation of portions of the hierarchy. If arbitrary links to directories were permitted, it would be quite difficult to detect when the last connection from the root to a directory was severed.</p>

<h3 id="33-special-files">3.3 Special Files</h3>

<p><mark>Special files constitute the most unusual feature of the UNIX file system. Each …</mark></p></section></div>
