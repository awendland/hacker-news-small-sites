  <article>
    <p>I’ve now worked with “The Cloud” for long enough to see that there’s still a long way to
go before it becomes materially better than, say, the oldschool method of renting a
couple of servers with a co-location company and running your software there. The
latest fad is Serverless, which makes me feel a lot like we’ve arrived in 1970.</p>

<p>A long, long time ago, I was pretending to study business administration
while teaching myself to code in C. The university was in two worlds:
we had a lab with “personal computers” but also terminals to the mini
computer and assignments had to be made on either one depending on the
professors’ preferences. But both systems were at least “on-line” systems–interactive, with immediate feedback. A friend of mine was not so lucky:
he had an assignment for one of his courses in civil engineering that
had to be completed in Pascal and had to be handed in as a print-out
from the university’s mainframe.</p>

<p>He called me in for help, because he never wrote a line of code before. So I hopped
over to his place, a Turbo Pascal floppy disk in hand, and assumed that we would
make short work of the assignment. And we did, even though I never coded in Pascal
before: the IDE, even back then, was marvellous and a quick succession of trial-and-error
got us the results we wanted (they were some simple engineering calculations, much
quicker done on even the most primitive of calculators, but such are course assignments. At
least it was easy for us to verify the program was correct).</p>

<p>We hopped into the car and drove over the the university’s computer center, a ’70s brutalist
concrete bunker. We sat behind a terminal, typed in the code, surrounded it with the required
IBM Job Control Language that the teaching assistant helpfully added to the assignment, and
hit “Enter” (not “Return”, actually “Enter” - Enter The Job). A couple of minutes later, the
printer started and spit out a couple of pages. Between gibberish in all caps, there it was: a
compiler error. Back to square one - Turbo Pascal and IBM Mainframe Pascal clearly had some
differences. A couple of hours and reams of wasted paper later, we had what my friend wanted:
the results of a good run. The numbers matched our notes, and we could retreat to the nearest
bar for a well-earned beer.</p>

<p>Ever since that experience, I have stressed the value of feedback and especially of quick
feedback. Even in this minimal example, we spent more time tweaking the code for the dialect
than we spent on writing it in the first place. Slow feedback loops kill performance, and if
you don’t believe me, find an online version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game">The Beer Distribution Game</a> and play it. You’ll be surprised.</p>

<p>The pinnacle of interactivity was, and still is, Smalltalk. I worked in that language for a
couple of years and having your system compile and run most of your tests in less than a second
is addictive. It is incredible how much your performance increases on a fully interactive
programming system but it takes first-hand experience to fully appreciate it. It’s a strange
system, a strange language, a tough sell; therefore Smalltalk is still in a very undeserved
state of limbo.</p>

<p>After my Smalltalk years, I met a lot of large Java systems. They started out as horrible
hairballs, but when the idea of “dependency injection” got a foothold, things started to get
better. Except for the return of the Job Control Language, this time disguised in XML and
carrying friendlier names like “Spring”. Internally, the code was reasonably clean and modular,
but telling the computer how to run it took pretty much the same amount of typing, this time
not in a programming language but in a structured markup language. That language lacked all
the facilities that apply to writing good code, so principles like “Don’t Repeat Yourself” went
overboard and copy/paste programming ensued. New business logic? New controller, twenty lines of
Java boilerplate, 10 lines of Java business logic, 50 lines of XML to wire it to the rest of
the system.</p>

<p>At least, in hindsight, XML was a blessing: your editor would tell you whether your “this is
how the code is wired up” description had the right structure, and later on even whether you
used names that existed in your Java codebase.</p>

<p>These systems took ages to compile, hours to run all the unit tests, and clearly interactivity
went down the drain. So “split it all up” was not a bad idea. It was an unnecessary idea, mostly
driven by the shortfalls of mainstream programming languages, but necessity is the mother of
invention - even though your average Java business app was much simpler than the Smalltalk
IDE before you added a single line of code to write your app, it was already too complex to
maintain and “divide and conquer” was the answer. Service Oriented Architecture, and later
microservices, was born. Split your codebase, split your teams, create a lot of opportunities
for mediocre coders to grow into mediocre engineering managers, everybody was happy. Including
your hardware vendor, because suddenly you needed much more hardware to run the same workloads. Because
networks are slow, and whereas it can be argued whether a three tier system is actually a distributed
computing system, a microservices system certainly qualifies for that label.</p>

<p>The return of the Job Control Language this time was in the form of,
again, configuration data on how to run your microservice. Microservices
were somewhat fatter than the very fine-grained objects of the old days,
so there was less of it, but still - it was there. The feedback cycle
became worse as well: in the monolith-with-XML days, your XML editor
would get you mostly there and a quick local compile and run would
leave you all but certain that your configuration was working.
XML, however, was universally rejected in favour of things like JSON, Yaml, HCL,
Toml - all free of structure, with zero indication whether a computer
would find your prose gibberish or the next Shakespeare play until
you actually pushed your code to some test cluster. It suddenly felt
a lot like being back at that university interacting with a mainframe,
but at least you still owned the hardware and could introspect all the
way down, especially if you were doing “DevOps” meaning mostly that you
had administrative access to your hardware.</p>

<p>Microservices have trouble scaling, and they are very complex. Most companies that employ them
have no need for them, but the systems and programming languages they employ are sufficiently
lacking that this stacking of complexity on top of complexity becomes a necessity. It seems that,
contrary to what everybody is saying, software developers are in plentiful and cheap supply so
wasting a lot of their talent makes economic sense over the perceived cost of adapting more
powerful programming systems. C’est la vie. The feedback cycle is truly broken - testing a
microservice is merely testing a cog in a machine and no guarantee that the cog will fit the
machine - but we just throw more bodies at the problem because Gartner tells us this is the future.</p>

<p>So, we’re now at the next phase of this game: maintaining these very complex systems is
hard and not your core business, so outsource it (simplifying it would cost too many managers’
jobs, so that is not an option). The Cloud was born, first as a marketing label for an old
business model (offering “virtual private servers” to the public), but more and more as a marketing
label for an even older business model (the mainframe - we run it, we own it, you lease capacity).</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">Worse Is Better</a> and you can do worse than Virtual Private Servers, so through a short-lived detour through
containerizing microservices and deploying them on a distributed scheduler like Mesos, Nomad,
or Kubernetes, we have arrived at “Serverless”. You deploy individual stateless functions. But
not inside a Java monolith, that is old, but on top of a distributed system. You would have been
laughed out of the door if you had proposed that in 2000, and you should be laughed out of the
door right now, but such is the power of marketing. So what have we now? A “mono repo” codebase,
because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment
descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called
“Function”, and instead
of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe. You
deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all
batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to
walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half
century. Oh, and a “Function”
will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed
a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew
can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.</p>

<p>History will repeat itself, of course. Conceptually, hiding a lot of the scaling and coordination
machinery is not a bad idea; programming systems like Erlang and OTP have shown for decades how
well that can work and Elixir is giving the platform a well-deserved surge in popularity. But there’s
a big difference here: a platform like OTP handles pretty much everything that a platform like
AWS Lambda handles, but it does it in a single programming language. Tools of the trade are
available: you can refactor Erlang code, you can write Elixir macros, all to keep the system
clean, malleable, and free of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>.</p>

<p>It is called “Configuration as Code”, and it truly is a great idea (but hardly a new one). But XML
is not code, and neither is JSON, nor YAML, nor HCL. There is an essential quality lacking in all
of these markup languages, and that causes all the copy/paste programming I am currently seeing
everywhere, whether a …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

VisUAL has been developed as a cross-platform tool to make learning ARM Assembly language easier. In addition to emulating <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/supported_instructions.html">a subset of the ARM UAL instruction set</a>, it provides visualisations of key concepts unique to assembly language programming and therefore helps make programming ARM assembly more accessible.

</p><p>It has been designed specifically to use as a teaching tool for the <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering/internal/curriculumee2">Introduction to Computer Architecture course</a> taught at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London.

</p>




<h2>Key Features</h2>



<h4>Navigate Program History</h4>

<p>In addition to stepping through code, users can navigate program history by browsing past register values. This feature can help debugging and understanding complex code easier.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/history_browsing.png" alt="history browsing"></p>



<h4>Pointer Visualisation</h4>

<p>Pointers in ARM assembly can be quite difficult to understand, especially since ARM assembly has 9 different variations of pointer behaviour when it comes to load/store instructions. VisUAL provides an information pane that displays useful pointer information when needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/pointer_visualisation.png" alt="pointer visualisation"></p>



<h4>Shift Operation Visualisation</h4>

<p>VisUAL can demonstrate shift operations by playing them as animations. The animations use actual data values from the shift instruction being demonstrated.</p>

  <source src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/shift_visualisation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video></p>



<h4>Memory Access Visualisation</h4>

<p>All memory access operations, word-aligned or byte-aligned,  can be visualised. Base and offset addresses are shown, and any values that have been changed are highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_visualisation.png" alt="memory visualisation"></p>



<h4>Stack Visualisation</h4>

<p>Instructions to load/store multiple instructions in the form of a stack can be visualised. Stack behaviour is described, and the stack as well as stack pointer at the start and end of the stack are displayed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/stack_visualisation.png" alt="stack visualisation"></p>



<h4>Branch Visualisation</h4>

<p>Colour coded line highlights are used to indicate when a branch is being taken. For conditional instructions, status bits involved in condition checking are highlighted. An arrow points to the branch destination, acting as a visual cue to indicate a branch to another line of code is about to take place.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/branch_visualisation.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>



<h4>Subroutine Visualisation</h4>

<p>Whenever the link register is set to enter a subroutine, the linked subroutine return point will be highlighted and will remain highlighted until the subroutine exits.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/subroutine_visualisation.png" alt="subroutine visualisation"></p>



<h4>Error Correction Suggestions</h4>

<p>As opposed to providing cryptic compiler error messages, VisUAL provides context-specific error messages with explanations of exactly what is expected. In addition, whenever a runtime error occurs, the user is informed of the problematic instruction and what operation in the instruction resulted in the error.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/syntax_error.png" alt="syntax error"> <img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/runtime_error.png" alt="runtime error"></p>



<h4>Infinite Loop Detection</h4>

<p>Inadvertently typed code that may result in an infinite loop can cause code to malfunction. VisUAL detects possible infinte loops and prompts the user to select the appropriate response.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/infinite_loop_warning.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>

<h4>View Memory Contents</h4>

<p>By using the view memory contents window, data defined in memory can be monitored in real-time as it changes. This allows fast debugging of memory access instructions from a static viewpoint in addition to the dynamic viewpoint provided by the pointer and memory access visualisations.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_window.png" alt="memory contents window"></p>
    
<h4>View Symbols</h4>
    
<p>The symbols window provides a list of all code and data symbols that have been defined. This provides an easy method of lookup up symbols during execution.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/symbols_window.png" alt="view symbols window"></p>
    


<h4>Headless Emulation Mode</h4>

<p>VisUAL allows assembly code to be executed via the command line and logs the program state to an XML file. This is useful for power users for testing large batches of code. See the <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/logging_guide.html">logging guide</a> for details on how to use this.</p>

December 19, 2020 | https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>One of my goals for 2020 was to stop using Google's products. There are a lot of reasons why, but that's not the point of this post. I found out about Nextcloud last month and it turns out it's a great replacement for a lot of Google. I don't actually use all of its features, but I've migrated my calendar, reminders, contacts, bookmarks, video calls, photos, and news feeds and I'm really happy with it so far.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies that will host Nextcloud for you where you just sign up for an account like anything else, but in case you're interested in hosting Nextcloud for yourself this post is basically a brain dump of how I did that. It took me a while to cobble together all the pieces I needed to get everything working from end to end, so I'm hoping this might save someone else from having to do the same. If you know your way around servers and Nextcloud already you can just skim the headings like a checklist to make sure you don't forget an important step. But if you want a succinct overview of the actual steps I did and commands I ran, each section contains those details. By the end you'll see how I installed Nextcloud on my own server, secured it, set up backups, and set up external storage for my photos.</p>
<p>Some parts are pieced together from other partial guides or longer blog posts, so where relevant the references lead to those sources. This post is more of a quick start with just the essential steps. Anything in <code>&lt;pointy-brackets&gt;</code> is meant to be replaced. So the actual command I ran was e.g. <code>adduser kira</code>, not <code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2>What this list assumes you already have</h2>
<ul>
<li>A domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.</li>
<li>An account with a cloud server provider. I use <a href="https://www.linode.com/choosing-linode/">Linode</a>.</li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">Healthchecks.io</a></li>
<li>Your ssh key</li>
<li>$75/year. I pay $5/month for the server I use, $5/year for the domain name ($5.16 actually), and CAD$10/year for carbon offsets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Set up a server running Ubuntu and set up ssh access for yourself</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spin up a new server with your cloud provider. I use a "nanode", the smallest server available from Linode, with 1GB of RAM and 25GB of storage, which is plenty more than <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/16/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#server">Nextcloud's minimum specs</a>.</li>
<li>Select an operating system that can install <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd">snap packages</a>. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS). Nextcloud recommends at least either Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.</li>
<li>Add your ssh key to the server. There should be a way to do this through the UI where you manage your new server.</li>
<li>Copy the IP address of your new server</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1. ssh into your server as the root user and make yourself a new sudo user that can also ssh into the machine <sup><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04">1</a></sup></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ssh <a href="https://kiramclean.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="dba9b4b4af9b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>usermod -aG sudo &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>rsync --archive --chown=&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt; ~/.ssh /home/&lt;name&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Close this ssh session and log in as your new user to make sure it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>logout</code></li>
<li><code>ssh &lt;name&gt;@&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave this ssh session open. The rest of the commands below are meant to be run on your server, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h2>2. Point your new server to your custom domain</h2>
<p>There should be a way to do this in the admin section for your server. On Linode's there's a "Domains" section in the left admin menu. From there I clicked "Add a Domain" in the top right, then filled in the domain name, my email address, and selected "Insert default records from one of my Linodes" from the "Insert Defaults Records" dropdown, then I selected my new Nextcloud server from the list of Linodes. The steps might be slightly different depending what cloud server provider you're using. By the end you need DNS records pointing your domain name to your Nextcloud server. If you did this through Linode (or whatever you're using), you'll also need to update the nameservers with your domain registar.</p>
<h2>3. Set up a basic firewall</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow OpenSSH</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow https</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow http</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw enable</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Install Nextcloud</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo snap install nextcloud</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.manual-install &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Set up your domain, enable https, and install an auto-updating certificate from Let's Encrypt</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=&lt;your-domain.name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Enable 2FA on your Nextcloud account <sup>*</sup></h2>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your new personal cloud at the domain you configured using the username and password you chose above and install the 2FA app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner of the Nextcloud dashboard and select "Apps"</li>
<li>In the left side bar click on "Security", then search for the "Two-Factor TOTP Provider" app</li>
<li>Click "Download and enable"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up 2FA with this newly installed app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner and select "Settings"</li>
<li>In the left sidebar, click on "Security" (in the "Personal" section) then check the "Enable TOTP" box and follow the instructions to set up 2FA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to forget my password in the time between installing Nextcloud and trying to log in for the first time. If that happens to you, you can reset it by running <code>sudo nextcloud.occ user:resetpassword &lt;username&gt;</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>* Doing this means you will be required to generate "app passwords" in order to log in to your Nextcloud account in third party apps or other devices (to use Nextcloud to sync your calendar or reminders to your phone, for example.) There's a tiny box with a button that says "Create new app password" at the bottom of the "Security" admin section (under "Personal", not "Administration") where you can do that.</small></p>
<h2>7. Set up backups</h2>
<h3>7.1. Turn on "local" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable backups for your whole server for a first layer of backups. I did this when I was setting up my Linode (there was a checkbox in the "Optional Add-ons" section for it). Otherwise there's a "Backups" tab in the admin section where you can turn them on. Linode charges $2/months for this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7.2. Set up "offsite" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install and set up Backblaze</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a bucket in Backblaze for your backups</li>
<li>Make an app key with access to your backup bucket</li>
<li>Get the Backblaze cli and configure it
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code></li>
<li><code>sudo pip3 install b2</code></li>
<li><code>sudo b2 authorize_account &lt;keyID&gt;</code></li>
<li>Copy the key secret from the app key you just made to authorize the Backblaze cli</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new user to run the backups and disable password access for it, for security <sup><a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-backup-nextcloud/">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo adduser ncbackup</code></li>
<li><code>sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin ncbackup</code> <sup>*</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create directories for the backups and logs</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo mkdir -p /home/ncbackup/backups/logs</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the backup script and make it runnable <sup>**</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo touch /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo vim /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code> and copy the contents of the backup script below into your new file, or write your own that accomplishes the same things: <sup>***</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -e

DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')

# Output to a logfile
exec &amp;&gt; /home/ncbackup/backups/logs/${DATE}.txt

# Export all your config and data from Nextcloud
echo "Starting Nextcloud export..."
nextcloud.export
echo "Export complete"

# Compress backed up folder
echo "Compressing backup..."
tar -zcf /home/ncbackup/backups/${DATE}.tar.gz -C /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backups/ .
echo "Nextcloud backup successfully compressed to /home/ncbackup/backups"

# Remove uncompressed backup data
rm -rf /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backups/*

# Remove backups and logs older than 5 days
echo "Removing backups older than 5 days..."
find /home/ncbackup/backups -type f -mtime +5 -delete
find /home/ncbackup/backups/logs -type f -mtime +5 -delete

# Keep 14 days of backups in Backblaze
echo "Uploading to Backblaze..."
b2 sync --keepDays 14 --replaceNewer /home/ncbackup/backups b2://&lt;your-bucket-name&gt;
echo "Nextcloud backup completed successfully"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Let the <code>ncbackup</code> user run the backup script as the root user
<ul>
<li><code>sudo visudo</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the end of the file that opens:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># Allow ncbackup to run script as sudo
ncbackup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>
<small>
* If you want to undo this for some reason you can run <code>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash ncbackup</code>
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
** Note this means you will have 6 copies of all your data on your server all the time -- 5 backups and the live versions. The backups are compressed, but it can still add up to a lot of space. Keep an eye on how much storage your server is using. Running it out of space will probably be one of the first issues you run into. I explain how to get notified when that's close to happening at the end.
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
*** You don't have to use vim here. Your server probably has nano installed or you can install the editor of your choice. To change the default editor on your server, run <code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor</code>, and choose the one you want.
</small>
</p>
<h2>8. Schedule and monitor your backups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make yourself a healthcheck at <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">healthchecks.io</a> and copy the ping url</li>
<li><code>sudo crontab -u ncbackup -e</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the bottom of the file: <code>0 2 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh &amp;&amp; curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 -o /dev/null &lt;your-ping-url&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will run your backups once per day at 2am (in your server's timezone, probably UTC), but you can set whatever time and frequency you want, just remember to update your healthcheck to match.</p>
<h2>9. Test your backups</h2>
<p>Backups are only useful if you can use them to restore your data. Make sure yours work before you need them.</p>
<p>To test your entire server backups you can just try restoring the whole server using Linode's (or whoever's) UI. Testing the archived backups we uploaded to Backblaze is a little more involved but you'll be glad you know how to do it when you need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat steps 1-5, except you can just update the records for your domain that's already set up to point to your new server's IP address(es).</li>
<li>Download one of your backups</li>
<li>Copy the backup onto your new server. Run this in a terminal on your machine (not in an ssh session with a remote server):
<ul>
<li><code>scp /local/path/to/your/backup/ &lt;user&gt;@&lt;new-server-ip-address&gt;:~</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>ssh into your new server for the rest of these commands</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip, rename, and move the backup to a place where the Nextcloud snap installation will be able to access it, then make the root user the owner
<ul>
<li><code>tar -xvzf &lt;backup-name&gt;.tar.gz</code></li>
<li><code>sudo mv &lt;backup-data-dir&gt;/ …</code></li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

	<h2>Notes &amp; Descriptions</h2>
	<h3>Program Versions &amp; Sources</h3>
	<p>The emulation is running various versions of the original game, both from binaries copies of the original paper tapes and newly assembled from authentic code listings. The programs are loaded as virtual paper tapes (RIM-mode: Read In Memory) into the memory of the emulated DEC PDP-1.</p>
	<p><img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/hingham-space-warfare-2.png" alt="Spaceships (stylized) according to the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare" title="Spaceships according to the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare" width="81" height="94"></p><p><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 3.1"><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong>, the final version of Spacewar! as left by the original programmers (Steve Russell and the other members of the <em>Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare</em>), is presented here once in its original form and in a modified version showing scaled up graphics and effects for the benefit of small screen sizes. Further, there are both earlier and later versions, as <strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 2B"><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> (the program described in <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> by J. M. Graetz) and some examples of <strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 4.1f"><span></span>version 4</strong> (adding minor features and compatibility to an upgraded hardware). Finally, there is a special version of Spacewar 3.1, demonstrating the "Winds of Space" effect.</p>
	<p><em>(Please mind that the title screens are generated by the emulator and are not part of the original games.)</em></p>
	<p>There are two display resolutions to select from:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Low resolution</strong>, plotting at 512 x 512 px, 50% of the original display.<br>Special subpixel rendering is employed in order to boost the visible resolution beyond the physical resolution provided by the display element in the browser.<br>The result corresponds closely (if not being even a bit better) to the visual resolution of the original display: While the display featured a resolution of 1024 x 1024 plotting locations, only approximately 512 points on each axis were "resolvable to the unaided eye" <cite>(DP-35-2 / PDP-1 Instruction Manual / Part 3; DEC 1971; p. 5)</cite>.<br>Compare these contemporary photos: <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-1" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J.

	</ul>
	<p>Versions available (by the <i>"versions menu"</i> at the top left of the emulated display):</p>
	<ul>

		<li id="spacewar3.1"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong> <span>(24 Sep 1962)</span><br>This could be regarded as the "standard version" of Spacewar!. The program is dated <em>"24 sep 62"</em> and is loaded from an authentic binary paper-tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">spacewar3.1_24-sep-62.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1bigships');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1, scaled ships</strong> <span>(low resolution only)</span><br>Scaled up graphics and effects to show the game in greater detail on a small display. (Colission radii and turning pivots of the ships have been adjusted accordingly.) This is quite similar to the presentation seen in other emulations. Please mind that the changes have minor effects on the gameplay.<br>
		The code is based on the original PDP-1 <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/_text/" target="_blank" title="Text-files in the archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">assembler sources</a> by Steve Russell as available at <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a> and was modified and newly assembled in 2014. (N. Landsteiner, 2014; this is not an authentic version!)</li>

		<li id="spacewar2b"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> <span>(2 Apr 1962)</span><br>This is the first complete version version of the game as presented at MIT's annual <em>Science Open House</em> in May 1962. Notably this is also the very version the background starfield (Peter Samson's <em>Expensive Planetarium</em>) was designed for, as this is annotated in the source code by <em>"stars by prs for s/w 2b"</em> and dated <em>"3/13/62, prs".</em> The program features the pre-particle-system "Crock Explosion" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-5" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig5.jpeg', 417, 422);} else { return true;}">[4]</a> and optionally a faster movement of the starfield (sense switch 4), torpedoes are single shot only (no salvoes). Some of the differences are more cosmetical: The ships' exhaust flames are half the size of later versions, also the display of the starfield hasn't found its final form yet (starting at an other position as compared to later versions). Moreover, the original starfield routine, found here, is modulating the varying brightnesses of the stars by how often the individual stars are drawn, whereas later versions are using the built-in intensity levels of the <em>Type 30 CRT</em> display instead.<br>For more on the making-of of Spacewar! see <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar" by J. M. Graetz</a>.<br>
		<span></span>The code is run from a binary paper tape image (RIM) labeled "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank" title="&quot;spaceWar_SA-5.bin&quot; in &quot;InsidePDP1_80s_box3&quot; at textfiles.com">spaceWar_SA-5.bin</a>". This has been proven to be identical to loading the two paper tapes "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20050823/" target="_blank" title="'spacewar2B_2apr62.bin' at textfiles.com">spacewar2B_2apr62.bin</a>" and "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="'stars.bin' at textfiles.com">stars.bin</a>", both to be found at bitsavers.org.<br>
		(<em>"SA-5"</em> is not a version string, but indicates the program's start address being 5, which would start the program in a setup for reading the input from the console test switches rather than from MIT's special control boxes, as would be the case with the default start address. The label suggests that this was a tape sent from MIT to an other facility.)<br>
		Spacewar! 2B is known with a date as early as 25 March 1962. This earlier version shows minor differences regarding the polarity of the sense switch settings.<br>
		<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/spacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.png" alt="Spacewar! — The Hyperspace Minskytron signature" title="The Minskytron signature effected by &quot;warp-induced photonic stress emission&quot;" width="75" height="105">
		<span></span>The program is presented here with two patches applied, namely the hyperspace-patch to include Martin Graetz's original hyperspace routine, the "<strong><a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/inside/insidespacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.html" target="_blank">Minskytron hyperspace</a></strong>" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-4" target="_blank" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig4.jpeg', 419, 416);} else {return true;}">[5]</a> and its <em>"warp-induced photonic stress emission",</em> and the auto-restart patch for seemless playing. (There are exactly three jumps to hyperspace per player.)<br>
		This represents the the game as described and depicted in J.M. Graetz's seminal article <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> and as presented at the <em>MIT Science Open House</em> in May 1962. (It still lacks a scorer-patch, which seems to be lost.)
		The patches are provided by the paper tape images "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">hyperspace85.bin</a>" <em>(Hyperspace VIci, 2 May 1962)</em> and  "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20030408/" target="_blank">spaceWarRstrt.bin</a>" — an other tape provides the same patch as "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">spacewAutoRestartPatch.bin</a>". (The auto-restart patch was to be applied to the hyperspace-patch and is by this officially a patch to a patch. Thus, loading the full program had become a fairly complex affair then, involving up to 6 tapes.)<br>
		<span></span>Listings of Spacewar! 2B and the patches may be found <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/sources/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
		<span></span>Please mind that this is still the game early in development. The restart-patch is missing an edge case (pun in­tend­ed), where the ships would collide at the "antipode" in the corners of the display. The game requires a manual restart in this situation.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1f"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1f</strong> <span>(20 Feb 1963; mod. for CHM 2005 – 2008)</span><br>This is the version apparently running at the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> (CHM).<br>This is Spacewar! 4.1 modified by <strong>Peter Samson</strong> in 2005–2008 to include the <strong>scorer routine of Spacewar! 4.8</strong>. Moreover, version 4.1f features modified brightness settings for the background starfield (for use at the CHM), which are here remapped to usual values by the emulator. (Otherwise most of the stars would remain invisible.) Like other version of Spacewar! 4.x it requires the hardware multiply/divide option and features the single shot switch for torpedoes. The source code is dated <em>"spacewar 4.1  2/20/63 dfw"</em> and annotated <em>"mod for CHM, 2005-06-01 - 2005-11-28  --prs",</em> and <em>"changed delay in score display, 2008-08-22  --prs.".</em> The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/from_peter_samson/" target="_blank" title="Archive PDP-1 codes provided by Peter Samson at textfiles.com">sw41f.rim</a>) provided by Peter Samson via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.2"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.2a');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.2a (4.1/4.2 dfw)</strong> <span>(22 Feb 1963 ?)</span><br>This is an authentic representative of the 4.x-generation of Spacewar! (probably by "dfw", like version 4.1 above), requiring the hardware multiply/divide option of the PDP-1. Additionaly to some internal modifications it features, like all versions 4, a working single shot mode for torpedoes (sense switch 3). The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040106/russell2/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #2 at textfiles.com">spacewar4.2a_sa4.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.<br>A visually distinctive detail of versions 4.x (4.1 and later) is the <em>"Sun"</em> (heavy star), now drawn by a dashed line like the rocket blasts, thus separating it visually a bit more from the starships (see the <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/fullscreen.html#version=4.2a" title="Full-scale version of Spacewar! 4.2 emulated in HTML5/Javascript">high-res/full-scale version</a> for a close-up view.) Also, two ships colliding in free fall in the center will explode at the <em>"antipode"</em> rather than at the center as with earlier versions of the game.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.3"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.3');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.3</strong> <span>(17 May 1963)</span><br>This is a version by Monty Preonas (signing <em>"ddp"</em>), who also provided the adaptations for the automatic hardware multiply/divide option and the new gravity computations used by all flavors of Spacewar! 4 in his version 4.0 <em>(2 Feb 1962)</em> earlier.<br>
		Spacewar! 4.3 features, like Monty Preonas' flavor of version 4.2 and version 4.4 (also signed <em>"ddp",</em> but presumably by Joe Morris), a special <strong>on-screen score display</strong>, very much like the one of the 4.8-scorer-patch (see the note on scores below). Like all versions by Monty Preonas, it usues an implementation of the background starfield alike the one of Spacewar! 2B.<br>
		The game features a special <strong>Twin Star mode</strong> to be engaged by sense-switch 2 (accessible by the <em>options menu</em> <img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/menubutton_small.png" width="20" height="16" alt="options menu icon" title="options menu icon"> at the top right corner of the screen). This visually distorted mode puts the <em>Needle</em> in the center of the screen in between a doubled sun and draws any other objects relatively to this ship. Moreover, some items are drawn at a double offset and torpedoes are displaced for real, resulting in a quite vexing game play. This mode was probably initially intended as an <em>ego view</em> from the <em>Needle's</em> perspective and left <em>as-is</em> as an amazing novelty. (Compare "Spacewar! 2015" below.)<br>
		<span></span>The program, dated <em>"5/17/63",</em> was newly assembled from source code provided in the assorted listings available at <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102664173" target="_blank" title="'Stars by prs for s/w 2b', CHM, catalog no. 102664173">CHM catalog no. 102664173</a> (which apparently came from Joe Morris, compare <cite><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.sys.pdp10/cNG89mmlbK0/V0JPyn3Mg7sJ" target="_blank">Joe Morris, alt.sys.pdp10, Jannuary 6, 2005</a></cite>).</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.8"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.8');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.8</strong> <span>(24 Jul 1963)</span><br>Apparently the final version of MIT-Spacewar!, dated <em>"7/24/63"</em> and signed <em>"dfw"</em>. A patch for a special <strong>on-screen scorer</strong> is available for this version (see the note on scoring below).<br>
		The game was newly assembled including the dedicated scorer patch. Sources <em>("spacewar4.8part1_engl.txt", "spacewar4.8part2_engl.txt", and "spacewar4.8_scorer.txt")</em> are available at <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040817/" target="_blank" title="Spacewar 4.8! sources and sorer-patch at textfiles.com">textfiles.com</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1hafb"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1hafb');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1 Holloman Air Force Base Version</strong><br>This is a reconstruction of a version of PDP-1 Spacewar! as seen at the Holloman Air Force Base (New Mexico) and described by John W. Andrews in December 1966 for "The Gamesman" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Gamesman_4-1967-12/page/n31" target="_blank" title="Archived copy of The Gamesman, issue 4, Dec. 1967 (archive.org)">The Gamesman, Issue 4, Dec 1967, pp 30-32</a>). Altered starting positions are probably the most interesting feature of this version. (Controls have been swapped accordingly to accommodate for this.)<br>

  </div><div><p>A little over a month after releasing Bevy 0.3, and thanks to <strong>66</strong> contributors, <strong>178</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="wasm-webgl2">WASM + WebGL2</h2>

<p>Bevy now has a WebGL2 render backend! @mrk-its has been hard at work building the <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy_webgl2">Bevy WebGL2 Plugin</a> and expanding <code>bevy_render</code> to meet the needs of the web. He also put together a nice website showcasing various Bevy examples and games running on the web. </p>
<p>I think the results speak for themselves:</p>
<h3 id="bevy-webgl2-showcase"><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/">Bevy WebGL2 Showcase</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/"><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-4/webgl_showcase.png" alt="webgl2 showcase"></a></p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-main-function">Cross Platform Main Function</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>On most supported Bevy platforms you can just use normal main functions (ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web). Here is the smallest possible Bevy app that runs on those platforms:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However some platforms (currently Android and iOS) require additional boilerplate. This arcane magic is error prone, takes up space, and isn't particularly nice to look at. Up until this point, Bevy users had to supply their own boilerplate ... but no more! <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> adds a new <code>#[bevy_main]</code> proc-macro, which inserts the relevant boilerplate for you. This is a big step toward our "write once run anywhere" goal.</p>
<p>This Bevy App has all the code required to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

#[</span><span>bevy_main</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="live-shader-reloading">Live Shader Reloading</h2>
<p>authors: @yrns</p>
<p>Bevy can now update changes to shaders at runtime, giving you instant feedback without restarting your app. This video isn't sped up!</p>

<h2 id="ecs-improvements">ECS Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a Bevy update without another round of ECS improvements!</p>
<h3 id="flexible-ecs-parameters">Flexible ECS Parameters</h3>
<p>Prior versions of Bevy forced you to provide system parameters in a specific order:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// This system followed the [Commands][Resources][Queries] order and compiled as expected
</span><span>fn </span><span>valid_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) {
}

</span><span>/// This system did not follow the required ordering, which caused compilation to fail
</span><span>fn </span><span>invalid_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Newbies would fall prey to this constantly. These completely arbitrary constraints were a quirk of the internal implementation. The <code>IntoSystem</code> trait was only implemented for specific orders. Supporting every order would have exponentially affected compile times. The internal implementation was also constructed with a <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/9afe196f1690a6a6e47bf67ac740b4edeffd97bd/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/into_system.rs#L158">famously complicated macro</a>.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I completely rewrote how we generate systems. We now use a <code>SystemParam</code> trait, which we implement for each parameter type. This has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significantly Faster Compile Times</strong>: We're seeing a <b>~25%</b> decrease in clean compile times</li>
<li><strong>Use Any Parameter Order You Want</strong>: No more arbitrary order restrictions!</li>
<li><strong>Easily Add New Parameters</strong>: It is now easy for us (and for users) to create new parameters. Just implement the <code>SystemParam</code> trait!</li>
<li><strong>Simpler Implementation</strong>: The new implementation is much smaller and also way easier to maintain and understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>// In Bevy 0.4 this system is now perfectly valid. Cool!
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>commands</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that in <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, commands now look like <code>commands: &amp;mut Commands</code> instead of <code>mut commands: Commands</code>. </p>
<h3 id="simplified-query-filters">Simplified Query Filters</h3>
<p>Up until now, Bevy's Query filters were intermingled with components:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B, </span><span>(&amp;</span><span>Transform, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Confused? You wouldn't be the first! You can interpret the query above as "give me immutable references to the <code>Transform</code> and <code>Velocity</code> components of all entities that have the <code>A</code> component, <em>do not</em> have the <code>B</code> component, and have a changed Velocity component".</p>
<p>First, the nesting of types via With / Without makes it very unclear whats going on. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> parameter does. Is it just a filter? Does it also return a Velocity component? If so, is it immutable or mutable?</p>
<p>It made sense to break up these concepts. In <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, Query filters are separate from Query components. The query above looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Query with filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, </span><span>(</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;) {
}

</span><span>// Query without filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This makes it much easier to tell what a Query is doing at a glance. It also makes for more composable behaviors. For example, you can now filter on <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> without actually retrieving the <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>And now that filters are a separate type, you can create type aliases for filters that you want to re-use:</p>
<pre><code><span>type </span><span>ChangedVelocity </span><span>= (</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;);

</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, ChangedVelocity</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="system-inputs-outputs-and-chaining">System Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining</h3>
<p>Systems can now have inputs and outputs. This opens up a variety of interesting behaviors, such as system error handling:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
  </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
    .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>result_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>().</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span><span>error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>()))
    .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>result_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt; {
  </span><span>let</span><span> transform </span><span>=</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>SOME_ENTITY</span><span>)?;
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>found entity transform: {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>);
  </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>error_handler_system</span><span>(</span><span>In</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>: In</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>error_handler</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MyErrorHandler</span><span>&gt;) {
  </span><span>if let </span><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>) =</span><span> result </span><span>{
</span><span>      error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_error</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>);
  }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.System.html"><code>System</code>
</a> trait now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Has no inputs and no outputs
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>()</span><span>, Out = </span><span>()&gt;

</span><span>// Takes a usize as input and return a f32
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>usize</span><span>, Out = </span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>We use this feature in our new Schedule implementation.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-v2">Schedule V2</h3>
<p>Bevy's old Schedule was nice. System registrations were easy to read and easy to compose. But it also had significant limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one Schedule allowed</li>
<li>Very static: you were limited to using the tools we gave you:
<ul>
<li>stages are just lists of systems</li>
<li>stages are added to schedules</li>
<li>stages use hard-coded system runners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Couldn't switch between schedules at runtime</li>
<li>Couldn't easily support "fixed timestep" scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these problems, I wrote a new Schedule system from scratch. Before you get worried, these are largely <em>non-breaking</em> changes. The high level "app builder" syntax you know and love is still available:</p>
<pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>my_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-trait">Stage Trait</h4>
<p>Stages are now a trait. You can now implement your own <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.Stage.html"><code>Stage</code>
</a> types!</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>MyStage</span><span>;

</span><span>impl </span><span>Stage </span><span>for </span><span>MyStage </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>world</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> World, </span><span>resources</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Resources</span><span>) {
        </span><span>// Do stage stuff here.
        // You have unique access to the World and Resources, so you are free to do anything
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-type-systemstage">Stage Type: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.SystemStage.html"><code>SystemStage</code></a></h4>
<p>This is basically a "normal" stage. You can add systems to it and you can decide how those systems will be executed (parallel, serial, or custom logic)</p>
<pre><code><span>// runs systems in parallel (using the default parallel executor)
</span><span>let</span><span> parallel_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());

</span><span>// runs systems serially (in registration order)
</span><span>let</span><span> serial_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>serial</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());

</span><span>// you can also write your own custom SystemStageExecutor
</span><span>let</span><span> custom_executor_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomExecutor</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-type-schedule">Stage Type: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.Schedule.html"><code>Schedule</code></a></h4>
<p>You read that right! <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.Schedule.html"><code>Schedule</code>
</a> now implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.Stage.html"><code>Stage</code>
</a> trait, which means you can nest Schedules within other schedules: </p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> schedule </span><span>= </span><span>Schedule</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>()
    .</span><span>with_stage</span><span>("</span><span>update</span><span>", </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()

        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
    )
    .</span><span>with_stage</span><span>("</span><span>nested</span><span>", </span><span>Schedule</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_stage</span><span>("</span><span>nested_stage</span><span>", </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>serial</span><span>()
            .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        )
    );
</span></code></pre><h4 id="run-criteria">Run Criteria</h4>
<p>You can add "run criteria" to any <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.SystemStage.html"><code>SystemStage</code>
</a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.Schedule.html"><code>Schedule</code>
</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>// A "run criteria" is just a system that returns a `ShouldRun` result

    )
</span></code></pre><h4 id="fixed-timestep">Fixed Timestep</h4>
<p>You can now run stages on a "fixed timestep".</p>
<pre><code><span>// this stage will run once every 0.4 seconds
</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>add_stage_after</span><span>(</span><span>stage</span><span>::</span><span>UPDATE</span><span>, "</span><span>fixed_update</span><span>", </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()

    .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>my_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This builds on top of <code>ShouldRun::YesAndLoop</code>, which ensures that the schedule continues to loop until it has consumed all accumulated time.</p>

<p>Now that stages can be any type, we need a way for <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> to interact with arbitrary stage types:</p>
<pre><code><span>app

AMA, largest U.S. medical professional group, called for increased regulatory oversight in 2009 and 2011.

Each gland produces one or more hormones that are released into the bloodstream. When they reach a target organ, they bind to specific receptors, triggering a response. Hormones are critical to reproductive function and are essential to normal development of the body and brain. The glands must be able to adjust hormone release in response to the changing environment to enable a healthy life.</p><h3 id="chart-production-of-selected-chemicals-and-plastics-in-the-united-states-in-2019-by-type">Chart: Production of selected chemicals and plastics in the United States in 2019, by type</h3><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: American Chemistry Council; US Census Bureau; US International Trade Commission; ICIS; Chemical Week; AFPM; TFI</figcaption></figure><p>The Endocrine Society described EDCs as an exogenous [non-natural] chemical, or mixture of chemicals, that interferes with any aspect of hormone action Today, a vast number of chemicals generated are in use.

<p>I was recently reading the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/huawei-cyber-security-evaluation-centre-oversight-board-annual-report-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 UK government security evaluation of Huawei</a> which provides a humorous example: developers for one of the LTE base stations literally used a <code>#define</code> to redefine unsafe_functions like <code>strcpy</code> to safer varients like <code>strlcpy</code>.

<p><em><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790270/HCSEC_OversightBoardReport-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report from the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board</a>, page 29, March 2019</em></p>
<p>In net, the report found that about 11% of <code>memcpy</code>-like and 22% of <code>strcpy</code>-like function calls in the codebase were to the least safe variants. And assuming safety just from the function name is simplistic—even the <em>safe</em> variants could still be dangerous.</p>
<p>In Huawei’s defense, while they have been subjected to an unusual level of public scrutiny they are definitely not an outlier in having trouble getting developers to adopt secure coding guidelines. In the <code>memcpy</code> case, it’s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090519182728/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288454.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned at Microsoft</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/05/15/microsoft_banishes_memcpy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2009</a>, but I haven’t personally seen any other companies outside the FAANG (Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google) that have done the same. You can actually tell who has banned the bad POSIX functions empirically, by looking at binaries—a non-profit named CITL did a great overview of this and more in the IoT space. As you’d probably guess, the <a href="https://cyber-itl.org/2019/08/26/iot-data-writeup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results are dismal</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clintgibler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Gibler</a> and I <a href="https://r2c.dev/global-appsec-sf-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently presented</a> at Global AppSec SF 2020 about what we think are some of the core principles for successfully bridging the developer/security divide. If you’re looking for a quick takeaway, we suggest three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be fast: scanning should run in parallel and be <em>faster than the slowest test</em>. Otherwise you’re blocking developer workflow.</li>
<li>Be early: if you’re going to complain, the editor is better than commit-time is better than CI.</li>
<li>Autofix: don’t just complain, offer a fix. Even an imperfect suggestion is better than nothing.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>P.S. If you have a giant C codebase sitting around and you want to figure out how much <code>strcpy</code> is used, the two fastest ways are probably <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripgrep, a hyper-fast grep</a> (noisy, fastest) or <a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep, a semantic grep-for-code</a> (precise, slower; full disclosure—I work on Semgrep!). Here’s how you could do it in both:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ rg --quiet --stats strcpy -tc
<span>163</span> matches
<span>..</span>.</code></pre></div>
<p>But ripgrep includes some false positives, like commented code:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>45</span>:// string.h is not guaranteed to provide strcpy on C++ Builder.</code></pre></div>
<p>We could obviously try to improve our regex to avoid <code>//</code> at the start of the line, but then we’d have to consider <code>/*</code> also, plus a lot more if we really want to do it right, so it might be nice to have a proper parser, which is what Semgrep provides. If you’re curious about the syntax, there’s an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online tutorial</a> that takes a few minutes or you can <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the docs</a>.</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ semgrep -e <span>"memcpy(...)"</span> --lang<span>=</span>c <span>.</span>
<span>..</span>.
ran <span>1</span> rules on <span>1710</span> files: <span>80</span> findings</code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that Semgrep has some parse failures on Webkit; <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C support is still in alpha</a>)</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>At Shopify we aim to make what most merchants need easy, and the rest possible. We make the rest possible by exposing interfaces to query, extend and alter our Platform. These interfaces empower a rich ecosystem of Partners to solve a variety of problems. The primary mechanism of this ecosystem is an “App”, an independently hosted web service which communicates with Shopify over the network. This model is powerful, but comes with a host of technical issues. Partners are stretched beyond their available resources as they have to build a web service that can operate at Shopify’s scale. Even if Partners’ resources were unlimited, the network latency incurred when communicating with Shopify precludes the use of Apps for time sensitive use cases.</p>
<p>We want Partners to focus on using their domain knowledge to solve problems, and not on managing scalable web services. To make this a reality we’re keeping the flexibility of untrusted Partner code, but executing it on our own infrastructure. We choose a universal format for that code that ensures it’s performant, secure, and flexible: WebAssembly.</p>

<p>What is WebAssembly? According to <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" title="WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly.org</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.”</p>
<p>To learn more, see this series of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/" target="_blank" title="A cartoon intro to WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">illustrated articles written by Lin Clark of Mozilla</a> with information on WebAssembly and its history.</p>
<p>Wasm is often presented as a performant language that runs alongside JavaScript from within the Browser. We, however, execute Wasm outside of the browser and with no Javascript involved. Wasm, far from being solely a Javascript replacement, is designed for <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/" target="_blank" title="Non-Web Embeddings - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Web and Non-Web Embeddings alike</a>. It solves the more general problem of performant execution in untrusted environments, which exists in browsers and code execution engines alike. Wasm satisfies our three main technical requirements: security, performance, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Executing untrusted code is a dangerous thing—it's exceptionally difficult to predict by nature, and it has potential to cause harm to Shopify’s platform at large. While no application is entirely secure, we need to both prevent security flaws and mitigate their impacts when they occur.</p>
<p>Wasm executes within a sandboxed stack-based environment, relying upon explicit imports to allow communication with the host. Because of this, you cannot <strong>express</strong> anything malicious in Wasm. You can only express manipulations of the virtual environment and use provided imports. This differs from bytecodes which have references to the computers or operating systems they expect to run on built right into the syntax.</p>
<p>Wasm also hosts a number of features which protect the user from buggy code, including protected call stacks and runtime type checking. <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/" target="_blank" title="Security - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">More details on the security model of Wasm can be found on WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In ecommerce, speed is a competitive advantage that merchants need to drive sales. If a feature we deliver to merchants doesn’t come with the right tradeoff of load times to customization value, then we may as well not deliver it at all.</p>
<p>Wasm is designed to leverage common hardware capabilities that provide it near native performance on a wide variety of platforms. It’s used by a community of performance driven developers looking to optimize browser execution. As a result, Wasm and surrounding tooling was built, and continues to be built, with a performance focus.</p>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>A code execution service is only as useful as the developers using it are productive. This means providing first class development experiences in multiple languages they’re familiar with. As a bytecode format, Wasm is targeted by a number of different compilers. This allows us to support multiple languages for developer use without altering the underlying execution model.</p>
<h2>Community Driven</h2>
<p>We have a fundamental alignment in goals and design, which provides our “engineering reason” for using Wasm. But there’s more to it than that—it’s about the people as well as the technology. If nobody was working on the Wasm ecosystem, or even if it was just on life support in its current state, <strong>we wouldn’t use it</strong>. WebAssembly is an energized community that’s constantly building new things and has a lot of potential left to reach. By becoming a part of that community, Shopify stands to gain significantly from that enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We’re also contributing to that enthusiasm ourselves. We’re collecting user feedback, discussing feature gaps, and most importantly contributing to the open source tools we depend on. We think this is the start of a healthy reciprocal relationship between ourselves and the WebAssembly community, and we expect to expand these efforts in the future.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered WebAssembly and why we’re using it, let’s move onto how we’re executing it.</p>
<p>We use an open source tool called <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime" target="_blank" title="Announcing Lucet: Fastly’s native WebAssembly compiler and runtime" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lucet</a> (originally written by Fastly). As a company, Fastly provides a programmable edge cloud platform. They’re trying to bring execution of high-volume, short-lived, and untrusted modules closer to where they’re being requested. This is the same as the problem we’re trying to solve with our Partner code, so it’s a natural fit to be using the same tools.</p>
<h3>Lucet</h3>
<p>Lucet is both a runtime and a compiler for Wasm. Modules are represented in Wasm for the safety that representation provides. Recall that you can’t <em>express</em> anything malicious in Wasm. Lucet takes advantage of this and uses a validation of the Wasm module as a security check. After the validation, the module is compiled to an executable artifact with near bare metal performance. It also supports ahead of time compilation, allowing us to have these artifacts ready to execute at runtime. Lucet containers boast an impressive startup time of <em>35&nbsp;</em><em><span>μs</span></em>. That’s because it’s a container that doesn’t need to do anything at all to start up.&nbsp; If you want the full picture, Tyler McMullan, the CTO of Fastly, did a great talk which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdWaQOgvd-g" target="_blank" title="Lucet: Safe WebAssembly Outside the Browser by Tyler McMullen" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gives an overview of Lucet and how it works</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="A flow diagram showing how Shopify uses our Wasm engine: Lucet wrapped within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390">
<figcaption>A flow diagram showing Shopify's Wasm engine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We wrap Lucet within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules, which we call the Wasm Engine. This engine is called by Shopify during a runtime process, usually a web request, in order to satisfy some function. It then applies the output in context of the callsite. This application could involve the creation of a discount, the enforcement of a constraint, or any form of synchronous behaviour Merchants want to customize within the Platform.</p>
<h3>Execution Performance</h3>
<p>Here’s some metrics pulled from a recent performance test. During this test, 100k modules were executed per minute for approximately 5 min. These modules contained a trivial implementation of enforcing a limit on the number of items purchased in a cart.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showcasing the time taken to execute a module. The x axis representing the time over the test was running and the y axis is the time represented in ms" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321">
<figcaption>Time taken to execute a module</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates a breakdown of the time taken to execute a module, including I/O with the container and the execution of the module. The y-axis is time in ms, the x-axis is the time over which the test was running.</p>
<p>The light purple bar shows the time taken to execute the module in Lucet, the width of which hovers around 100 μs. The remaining bars deal with I/O and engine specifics, and the total time of execution is around 4 ms. All times are 99th percentiles (p99).To put these times in perspective, let’s compare these times to the request times of <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite" target="_blank" title="How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Storefront Renderer, our performant Online Store rendering service</a>:</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showing Storefront Renderer Response time" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459">
<figcaption>Storefront Renderer response time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates the request time to Storefront Renderer over time. The y-axis is request time in seconds. The x-axis is the time over which the values were retrieved. The light blue line representing the 99th percentile hovers around 700 ms.</p>
<p>Then if we consider the time taken by our module execution process to be generally under 5 ms, we can say that the performance impact of Lucet execution is negligible.</p>
<h2>Generating WebAssembly</h2>
<p>To get value out of our high performance execution engine, we’ll need to empower developers to create compatible Wasm modules. Wasm is primarily intended as a compilation target, rather than something you write by hand (<a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html" target="_blank" title="Writing WebAssembly By Hand" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">though you can write Wasm by hand</a>). This leaves us with the question of what languages we’ll support and to what extent.</p>
<p>Theoretically any language with a Wasm target can be supported, but the effort developers spend to conform to our API is better focused on solving problems for merchants. That’s why we’ve chosen to provide first class support to a single language that includes tools that get developers up and running quickly.At Shopify, our language of choice is Ruby. However, because Ruby is a dynamic language, we can’t compile it down to Wasm directly. We explored solutions involving compiling interpreters, but found that there was a steep performance penalty. Because of this, we decided to go with a statically compiled language and revisit the possibility of dynamic languages in the future.</p>
<p>Through our research we found that developers in our ecosystem were most familiar with Javascript. Unfortunately, Javascript was precluded as it’s a dynamic language like Ruby. Instead, we chose a language with familiar TypeScript-like syntax called <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/" target="_blank" title="AssemblyScript" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AssemblyScript</a>.</p>
<h2>Using AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>At first glance, there are a huge number of languages that support a WebAssembly target. Unfortunately, there are two broad categories of WebAssembly compilers which we can’t use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilers that generate environment or language specific artifacts, namely node or the browser. (Examples: <a href="https://github.com/tweag/asterius" target="_blank" title="Asterius: A Haskell to WebAssembly compiler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asterius</a>, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank" title="Blazor Build client web apps with C#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Blazor</a>)</li>
<li>Compilers that are designed to work only with a particular Runtime. The modules generated by these compilers rely upon special language specific imports. This is often done to support a language’s standard library, which expects certain system calls or runtime features to be available. Since we don’t want to be …</li></ul></div></div>

  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-flute.jpg" alt="Pytest Flute" title="Pytest Flute">

  <p>I occasionally enjoy solving algorithmic problems, for example <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">The Advent of Code</a>.
I’ve been doing them since I was a pimply PHP-slinging teenager, competing with my peers across the UK in the British Informatics Olympiad.
It was terribly nerdy and terribly fun.</p>

<p>Algorithmic problems are often used in technical interviews, which I find less fun.
Strict deadlines stress me out.</p>

<p>In either case, using automated tests makes these problems way easier.
I wish I knew this earlier!</p>

<p>Online algorithmic platforms, such as <a href="https://codility.com/">Codility</a>, provide their own automated tests.
You use these for basic validation on some examples, but edge cases are sneakily reserved for final marking.
To ensure your solution covers all the bases, you need to write your own tests.</p>

<p>In Python, there’s no better test framework than <a href="https://pytest.org/">Pytest</a> - I use it on all my open source projects.
It makes it easy for you to add tests for any Python code.
And it’s much better than Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>unittest</code> is an old horse and cart, while <code>pytest</code> is the batmobile.</p>

<p><img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-pytest.png" alt="Pytest homepage"></p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a small problem together using Pytest.
Here’s the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function <code>solve(items)</code> that takes <code>items</code>, a list of integers, and returns the smallest integer greater than 0 that appears in the list, or 0 if there is none.</p>

  <p>For example <code>solution([1, 2])</code> should return 1, and <code>solution([-1])</code> should return 0.</p>

  <p>The list <code>items</code> will contain up to 1,000,000 integers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let’s write the most basic sketch of a <code>solve</code> function.
Since 0 is a default value to return, if we always return that we can score some easy points.
Create a file called <code>example.py</code> with the contents:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s test the function manually by running it in the Python 3 interpreter. Open the command line and run the examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 14 2019, 21:08:36)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from example import solve
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([1, 2])
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([-1])
0</code></pre></figure>

<p>So we failed on the first example, but succeeded with the second.</p>

<p>Doing this each time we modify the code would get tiresome quickly.
We have to restart the interpreter, rerun the import and tests, and manually compare the outputs.
Writing automated tests now, before we’ve tried to solve the problem properly, makes the whole loop faster.
It also makes us think about all the cases up front.</p>

<p>Let’s write the tests and solve the problem with the <strong>Red, Green, Refactor</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="red">Red</h3>

<p>First, let’s add tests that fail.</p>

<p>Pytest can work with tests in the same file as our code, as simple functions with names starting <code>test_</code>.
We use Python’s <code>assert</code> statement to compare the results of our code with our expectations.</p>

<p>Add tests for the two examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_1</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_2</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then install Pytest and run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python -m pip install pytest

E        +  where 0 = solve([1, 2])

example.py:5: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.03 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the middle of the output, we see the tests in <code>example.py</code> running.
Pytest outputs an <code>F</code> for the failing test, and a dot <code>.</code> for the passing one.</p>

<p>The <code>FAILURES</code> section expands on the failure with the line that failed.
It then shows that <code>solve([1, 2])</code> returned <code>0</code> which doesn’t compare equal to the expected value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The tests we have are a start but they don’t cover all the cases.
We don’t have any lists that contain <code>0</code>.
Also two extremes are missing: the empty list and a list of 1,000,000 items.
Long lists could also contain lots of negative or positive integers, so we should try both of these.</p>

<p>Let’s add more tests.
We can make a list of 1,000,000 items in Python by multiplying a short list.
Add these tests at the end of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_empty_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>

<p>Run them again:</p>

<p>There are more failures - which is good!</p>

<h3 id="green">Green</h3>

<p>Now we can work to a solution that makes all the tests pass.
Replace <code>solve</code> with this first attempt:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================

example.py:30: AssertionError
====================== 2 failed, 4 passed in 0.17 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>We have two different failures now.
It seems we have yet to ignore negative numbers, woops!</p>

<p>Modify the solution to do so, by adding the <code>i &gt; 0</code> condition:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>):</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="collected">def solve(items):
    return min((i for i in items if i &gt; 0), default=0)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-running the tests produces the same, all-passing output as above.
Yay, we got the code down to one line!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.</p>
<p>A while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string "VMWare" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information. </p>
<p>Once I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper <a href="http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf">[1]</a> related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.</p>
<p>The end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.</p>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>Now that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info">[2]</a> can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'webgl'</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>debugInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getExtension</span><span>(</span><span>'WEBGL_debug_renderer_info'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_VENDOR_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>vendor</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>renderer</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, extension availability can be queried using the <strong><em>getExtension</em></strong> method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from <a href="https://webglreport.com/">[3]</a> WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="alt-text" src="https://bannedit.github.io/resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png" title="VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com">
<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>width</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>height</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>color_depth</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>colorDepth</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>bitspp</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>pixelDepth</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details on the screen object can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_screen.asp">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Can we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/">[6]</a></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>ram</span> <span>=</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>deviceMemory</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the <a href="https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/">[7]</a> Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past. Core Estimator also provides the Javascript libraries on github <a href="https://github.com/oftn-oswg/core-estimator">[8]</a>.</p>

<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome 2 CPU Cores Tested with Core Estimator</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues. </p>

<p>This is the third part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">II</a>, IV) look at the Dothraki from George R.R. Martin’s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>.  We’re looking at, in particular, the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up in the face of research.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">Last week</a>, we looked at the subsistence systems of historical Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans and found that the Dothraki subsistence system was less than a pale imitation of them, having stripped out nearly every activity from the daily routine of survival which wasn’t brutal or violent.</p>



<p>This week, we’re going to keep looking at the elements of culture beyond simple subsistence (with the caveat, noted last time, that subsistence systems often dictate over elements of culture).  Necessarily, this is going to make this post a bit more of an <em>omnium gatherum</em> catch-all, with a bunch of discrete topics.  In each case, it is going to make more sense to introduce the Dothraki practice and then contrast it the practices of the Great Plains and the Eurasian Steppe.</p>



<p>I want to note up front, <strong>we’re going to be talking here about slavery, sex, sexual violence, and regular violence</strong>, both as they occur in <em>ASoIaF</em>/<em>GoT</em> and how they occurred in the real world.  I try to keep this blog mostly G-rated, but history itself wasn’t always G-rated and <em>ASoIaF</em> certainly isn’t; reader discretion is advised.  In the interest of keeping clear which section is which, I have dropped my <em>hilarious</em> ‘An X of Ys’ joke section-title format and instead tried to give very descriptive section titles so you can decide if there is one or two you just want to skip.</p>



<p>Also, I want to note before we start that this post is going to be a bit more book-heavy than show-heavy, just because it is generally easier to pin down things which are explicitly said in the book rather than things implied by the visual language of the show.  <strong>That said, I think the show, if anything, magnifies the characterization the book presents on each of today’s topics</strong>, either dialing them up to 11 or (in the cases where the books have oddly excluded things) making that exclusion more intentional and explicit given the different nature of film (since in a book, if an object is not described in a scene, we may assume it is still there and just undescribed; in a visual medium, if it is not seen, it is not there).</p>



<p>And as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>Finally, as a reminder that we are not merely unfairly picking on some fantasy author who just wanted to create fictional societies without any tether to, or comment on, real societies which existed in the past or exist today, <strong>the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>A statement which claims, quite directly, that the Dothraki are modeled primarily off of both Eurasian Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans (with a ‘dash’ of fantasy).</p>



<h2>A Collection of Cultures</h2>



<p>(Ok, I had <em>one</em> more too-cute-by-half section title left)</p>



<p>The first thing to touch on here is not a cultural element but rather a fact about Dothraki culture, which is simply that:<strong> there is <em><span>a</span></em> ‘Dothraki culture.’  </strong>The Dothraki have a single language, a single holy city (Vaes Dothrak), a single system of social organization (Khals, etc), apparently a single set of dietary customs, a single religion with a well-understood prophecy of a future leader, and so on.  <strong>In short, there is a <em>single</em> Dothraki culture</strong> which is shared by all of the various <em>khalasars</em> of the Dothraki Sea.  Crucially this is not merely an observation made by characters <em>outside</em> of the Dothraki culture (that would be understandable – significant cultural divides are often invisible to outsiders who cannot mark the significance of ‘small’ differences), but is also a fact observed by the Dothraki themselves, explicit in things like the collective housing of all windowed <em>khaleesi</em> and even in the language the Dothraki use to talk about each other, especially in contrast to the Lhazareen and other non-Dothraki.  <strong>This is a single culture without any real ethnic divisions and is regarded as such by its members</strong>, not just outsiders.</p>



<p>And that is <em>nonsense</em>.</p>



<p>Even if we only take the Eastern <em>third </em>of the Eurasian Steppe (the Eurasian steppe actually divides quite neatly in thirds, broken up by the Ural mountains (dividing the western and central steppe), and the Fergana Valley (dividing the central and eastern steppe)), we have not <em>just</em> the Mongols, but Tatars, Keraites, Naimans, Merkits, Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Khitans, and (sort of) Jurchen.  <strong>Those are meaningful differences!</strong>  There are, for instance, two entire distinct language <em>families</em> on the Steppe (I should note that there is some dispute here about the lines between language families, but my impression is that the consensus now is that the Mongolic and Turkic languages are not directly related as they were once believed to be), each containing a number of often non-mutually intelligible languages within them (the Turkic language family has some 35 documented languages).  <strong>These groups were often not only linguistically distinct, but culturally and religiously distinct.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Great Plains were no less varied!</strong>  Isenberg’s chart (<em>op. cit.</em>, 59) – mentioned last week and based on US Government data – lists Assiniboine, Atsina, Comanche, Blackfeet, Koiwa (and Kiowa-Apache), Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho as the nomadic peoples of the Great Plains (it also lists 11 more sedentary Native peoples).  And that understates the variety because – remember – this is a survey from the <em>outside</em> which is going to miss significant variety (like not breaking out the Lakota from the Dakota, etc.)!</p>



<p>This brings us to two crucial points.  <strong>The <em>first</em> problem is that the lack of cultural and lingustic variety is itself an error on Martin’s part</strong>.  This isn’t quite a unique problem for the Dothraki – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">as I’ve noted, particularly with The North, many of the regions of Westeros are a lot less varied than they ought to be given their size</a> – but it is more pronounced here.  <strong>The Dothraki Sea is about as large on the map as <em>all six</em> of the Southern parts of the Seven Kingdoms, but has nowhere near the cultural diversity</strong> despite lacking a unifying government or hegemonic religion (as a rule, large nation-states are the <em>product</em> of state-building, not a prerequisite.  To put it bluntly, France is full of French people because the government in Paris saw fit to make it that way.  There is no such homogenizing institution in the Dothraki Sea).  Again, I don’t expect Martin to bring the story to a screeching halt to discuss this, but think about how much the feeling of a real culture could have been enhanced even a little by having Khal Drogo’s army involve multiple ethnicities of Dothraki nomads, or to have him refer to equivalents of the Merkits or Tartars (we may call these non-existent cultures the Nopethraki) occupying other parts of the Dothraki Sea and possibly trading at Vaes Dothrak.  Something just as simple as meeting other nomads either at the wedding or in Vaes Dothrak who spoke a different language (or given the size of Khal Drogo’s <em>khalasaar</em>, have him brag – as many historical rulers were want to do – about all of the many different Nopethraki peoples who also followed him).</p>



<p><strong>The second problem this creates is for this post</strong>.  While we have one fictional culture to compare, we have to compare it with <em>dozens</em> of real historical peoples – an obviously impossible task in this format (or probably any format).  For the sake of keeping this manageable, I am going to reduce my points of comparison specifically to the Mongols (c. 1150-1250) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_Nation">Sioux </a>(also known as the ‘Seven Council Fires’ though note that this is <em>also</em> a diverse grouping, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language">Lakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_language">Western and Eastern Dakota</a>).  Fortunately for me, these two sets are peoples <em>specifically</em> cited by Martin as inspirations for the Dothraki.  Where relevant, I will jump to other groups, but we’ll mostly focus on these two.  <strong>We are going to move topically to see how much the Dothraki are rooted in anything we can identify from these real historical cultures that supposedly inspired them.</strong></p>



<h2>Music and Art</h2>



<p><strong>Try as I might, I could not find any clear reference to Dothraki artwork. </strong> Vests are described repeatedly as painted (AGoT, 83, 193), but apart from the exceptional one made for Viserys (AGoT, 329), how they are painted doesn’t seem to ever be mentioned.  One might fairly call Dothraki hair braiding and belling an art (AGoT, 30), but while the number of braids matters, it doesn’t seem like the quality or artistry is ever commented on.  The statues that line the way to Vaes Dothrak are all captured, the “ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki have sacked” (AGoT, 324) and Vaes Dothrak itself lacks its own building style, instead being a mix of styles of peoples the Dothraki have enslaved (AGoT, 326-7).  Drogo’s palace has just “rough-hewn timbered walls” and Daenerys smiles to herself at the contrast between the expected grandeur and the actual building (AGoT, 327), apparently devoid of decoration.  It’s possible that the bride-gift weapons (<em>AGoT</em>, 86) were decorated – the materials in question were clearly lavish – but we are not told.  Later, Daario Naharis has a decorated <em>arakh</em> (in the shape of a naked woman, because <em>of course</em>, <em>ASoS</em>, 482), but he is …</p></div></div>

<p><strong><em>Ian Harris explains that more than half of commonly performed surgical operations may be placebos. Adequate studies using a blinded control group are essential.</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/surgery-surgeon-ongoing-operate.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><br>Ian Harris, a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, wrote a book titled&nbsp;Surgery, The Ultimate Placebo. I haven’t read the book, but I watched his excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzueFu1cq5U">YouTube video lecture</a>&nbsp;on the subject. It is an eye-opening evaluation of commonly performed surgical operations that have been tested and shown to be no more effective (and arguably worse) than placebo, or that have never even been tested. He covers the history of sham surgery studies, talks about placebo effects, and explains why so many surgeons ignore the evidence and continue to do ineffective operations. In the process, he provides a valuable education in critical thinking.</p>



<p>His introduction to skepticism at age 18 was a documentary on television where dowsers were subjected to an elegant controlled test by James Randi and Dick Smith. They buried ten pipes and challenged dowsers to determine which pipe the water was flowing through. When they knew which pipe was active, the dowsers all identified it correctly; but when they didn’t know, they were only right 12% of the time. He was impressed by how a simple test could easily refute a claim.</p>



<p>When he watched the same documentary again recently, he was impressed by the reaction of dowsers when shown that dowsing didn’t work. He recognized it as the same reaction he was seeing in surgeons when their operations were tested and shown not to work. They made up excuses, hypotheses about why the experiment might not have given the results they expected, and said they wouldn’t give up doing the operation, “because it works”.</p>



<p>In the early 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, a common operation for heart disease was internal mammary artery ligation. It seemed obvious that it worked: patients felt better. In 1939, a sham surgery experiment showed that an equal number of patients got better if the surgeon just made an incision but didn’t ligate the arteries. Surgeons heeded the evidence and stopped doing that operation.</p>



<p>He takes us on a historical tour of surgical operations that have been tested and shown not to work. Surgeons often reject the evidence and make up rationalizations as to why it might not have worked in those studies, but they remain convinced that it does work&nbsp;<em>in their hands</em>. When they refuse to stop doing that operation, their excuses sound just like those of the dowsers. They insist on continuing to do the operation “because it works” (in their experience). Billions of dollars are being wasted on hundreds of thousands of operations that have been shown not to work or that have never even been tested to see if they work better than doing nothing.</p>



<h2>False analogies and faulty reasoning</h2>



<p>Theory often says an operation&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;work, but&nbsp;<strong>biological plausibility means absolutely nothing</strong>&nbsp;unless tests can show that it&nbsp;<em>really does work</em>. Dr. Harris says “You can make up a biologically plausible mechanism for&nbsp;<em>anything you want</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>The parachute analogy</strong>&nbsp;says you don’t need a randomized controlled study of parachutes to find out if they work. Dr. Harris says he has seen it frequently invoked, usually for procedures that are later shown to be rubbish.</p>



<p><strong>Comparative effectiveness studies</strong>&nbsp;are done comparing two different methods of something like steroid injections for back pain, but they don’t tell us whether either of them work. They would be better called comparative ineffectiveness studies. The first step should have been to use a control group and compare steroid injections to no injections.</p>



<h2>Perceived effectiveness</h2>



<p>Perceived effectiveness is a combination of two things: the treatment’s specific effects plus its placebo effects.</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;<strong>shortcuts in thinking</strong>&nbsp;that all humans are hard-wired to take. They assume correlation means causation, and they fall for the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Post_hoc,_ergo_propter_hoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a></em>&nbsp;fallacy (assuming that if B follows A that must mean that A caused B). These shortcuts in thinking often lead to errors. Improvement might be due to something other than the surgery, like the natural history of the disease, regression to the mean, or concomitant treatments.</p>



<p>Improvement can be perceived by the patient (sometimes it is a false perception due to placebo factors or misinterpretations) and/or by the doctor, due to factors like measurement error, reporting bias, confirmation bias, etc. Doctors rate the effectiveness of their treatments higher than their patients do. The perception of the doctors is&nbsp;<em>wrong</em>; they consistently overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of their treatments.</p>



<h2>Treatment is not always needed</h2>



<p>He tells the story of Archie Cochrane, for whom the Cochrane Collaboration of systematic analyses was named. As the only doctor in a POW camp in World War II, he was responsible for 10,000 prisoners, many suffering from open wounds, dysentery, typhoid, and other serious diseases. His requests for doctors and medicines were denied by his German captors, who said doctors were superfluous. In six months, only 4 prisoners died, each of them shot while trying to escape. The rest all got better, without treatment.</p>



<p>Harris’ story&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1444794/?page=1">distorts the truth</a>, but it serves as a vivid illustration of an important fact: recovery often occurs without any treatment. Cochrane’s experience led him to question much of what was being done in the name of medicine. Patients were kept in bed for a week after a heart attack not because of any evidence, but just “because it makes sense”. Cochrane did a controlled study and found that bedrest was actually harming people.</p>



<h2><em>Surgery often acts as a placebo</em></h2>



<p>Harris covers the many factors that affect a patient’s response to a placebo. A systematic review found that placebo was just as effective as surgery in over half of the cases studied, and&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the recent trials comparing surgery to placebo have found that surgery was no better than placebo.</p>



<p>He demolishes all the arguments surgeons give for continuing to do these operations that have been tested and shown not to work. The real reason is that they continue to&nbsp;<em>believe the procedure is effective</em>, just as the dowsers continued to believe they could find water with a forked stick. Tradition and personal experience triumph over science and reason.</p>



<p>Science is just a systematic way to reduce error. Imperfect, but better than any other way. Blinded trials are the least biased way to determine effectiveness.</p>



<h2>Ethical concerns</h2>



<p>Some people object that doing sham surgeries is unethical. Placebos are unethical in clinical practice for treating an individual, but not in research where they are essential to finding the truth and balancing harms and benefits for large groups of people and for preventing future harms. Surely, it’s unethical to perform ineffective surgeries. On Science-Based Medicine, we are constantly questioning the ethics of selling dietary supplements with claims that have never been properly tested. Some herbal medicines might be harmless, but surgery always carries a risk of infection, tissue damage, and adverse effects. And it is expensive: millions of dollars are being wasted worldwide on procedures that expose patients to risk for no possible benefit.</p>



<h2>Conclusion: Evidence is essential</h2>



<p>He concludes by saying we should treat new surgical procedures like new drugs, and only pay for those that are part of a trial to find out if they work. Most surgical procedures being done today have not been subjected to blinded trials.</p>



<p>Advice to patients: it’s OK to ask for a second opinion, and you should always ask your surgeon for the evidence showing the benefits and risks of the procedure, and what you can expect to happen if surgery is not done.</p>

    <div><div><div><div><p>I bought the new M1 Apple Silicon MacBook Air, and this is an article about why I did it, what was my decision process, what are my first impressions, and how I've approached the initial setup. The artcile is just a quick brain dump for the purposes of sharing my experiences with my friends and other readers of my blog, so don't expect any benchmarks or anything like that, this is not a serious review.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-bought-new-computer">Why I bought new computer<small><a href="#why-i-bought-new-computer" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<p>My computer's display started slowly dying this year, suffering from gradually more and more serious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbR2VhHLuW0">ghosting</a>. By November it was so bad that I could barely read any letters after an hour or two of using the machine. It's MacBook 12" early 2015, which I bought a few years ago, second hand, refurbished.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>refurbished</em> should mean that the computer was used as a sample machine somewhere, e.g. in an Apple Store. When they didn't need it anymore, it got checked for defects and sold for a cheaper price as a second hand product in a very good shape. My theory is that the computer was almost unused by the time I've bought it, but perhaps it was open with the display shining all the time in the shop, so durability of the pixels suffered a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to that, the machine's performance is a total potato these days. I have always appreciated its portability (size and weight of a magazine) and silence (has no fan), but I've spent most of this year at home, so I didn't care about portability, and the world got more bloated, so the minimum requirements for a smooth user experience are higher than in 2015. So by the summer 2020 I found myself wishing a new machine, and it just happened that Apple was about to release something with the new processors. I decided to wait, because I thought that (at the time) the latest machines would get cheaper if Apple releases something new.</p>

<li><a href="https://singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">Apple Silicon M1: Black. Magic. Fuckery.</a> - compilation of various first impressions</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away</a> - general review</li>
<li><a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2">Why Is Apple’s M1 Chip So Fast?</a> - how they made it and why competition won't be able to compete</li>

</ul>
<p>After that, I decided I'll buy the new Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air, because it doesn't make sense to go for anything older if I plan to have the new computer for as many years as possible going forward. It's not <em>cheap</em> cheap, but it's still huge performance for a reasonable price. Honestly, I'm surprised I happen to be buying a freshly released Mac announced just a few weeks ago, when so far I've been buying only second-hand Apple hardware, but it just felt like it makes sense to do this, all things considered.</p>
<p>I decided I don't need more RAM than 8 GB, because nobody from the first reviewers managed to give the RAM a hard time. It seemed to me it's a different beast altogether and it doesn't make sense to just compare numbers and say that more is better. Apple allows you to buy a computer with more than 8 GB RAM, but I think it's just a trap how to satisfy and charge those who don't believe the reviews and just want more RAM whatever it takes.</p>
<p>I also decided I want 512 GB drive, as I'm used to that size and I didn't want to downgrade. Also, I had serious capacity problems with my 16 GB iPhone SE and my wife still has serious capacity problems with her 128 GB old Air, so I really wanted to avoid that in the future.</p>
<p>I decided I don't mind that Docker or any kind of virtualization isn't supported (yet), because I don't use it. I'm self-employed solo enterpreneur now and Docker or Kubernetes play no role in my dev stack, also I use no virtual machines, nothing like that. If I was about to get a regular job somewhere, I assume they'd provide me a dedicated work computer. Also, I think <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/download-and-try-the-tech-preview-of-docker-desktop-for-m1/">it's gonna be resolved soon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions<small><a href="#first-impressions" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<p>The new Air arrived this Tuesday, so as of writing this article, I work on it for 4 days. To be honest, upgrading from a years old machine with a dying display and a potato performance, to this shiny new beast, is… It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>The change in responsivity is really significant and I totally love it. I don't think I've ever used anything faster. With my potato machine I got used to going to bloated websites from my phone, as it felt that iPhone X can deal with them much better, but now the phone feels slow. <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">The optimized apps</a> are super snappy. Safari runs smooth and fast like crazy. Firefox the same. Spotify, Slack, Discord, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, all the annoying bloated websites, which I used to hate so much for the past months, now run like if they were the most optimized websites on the internet. Honestly, I have problems to grasp the speed by my brain. It's just too much of a difference compared to my previous experience. It's like riding on a sloth and then suddenly switching to a super sonic rocket. I feel like I click on a tab in my browser and it happens instantly, and then it takes billion milliseconds until my brain realizes the action has been already performed and I can proceed to whatever else I wanted to do. I can now actually say when something needs network, because everything else is super fast. Whenever there's the slightiest lag, it's because network is involved, and because my network is slow.</p>
<p>I wanted to go with clean installation, so I didn't do any kind of smart restore from backup or anything like that. Just setting up the new system and moving my files, installing a few programs, like in the old days. Thanks to fast USBs and SSDs on both the computers and my external drive, moving the data was very fast, took just a few minutes.</p>
<p>I didn't upgrade to Catalina with my old laptop, because I wanted to play my 32bit Steam games, so macOS Big Sur is a quite a change for me now. A lot of setting up in the beginning, but all quite straightforward. A few surprises, such as zsh being the default shell in macOS now (change by <code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code>). Finally I can set Finder to sort by name AND have folders at the top, at the same time. For me as a person who switched to macOS from other systems, it has always felt so silly that this wasn't possible.</p>
<h3 id="touchid">TouchID<small><a href="#touchid" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>Having TouchID as part of the computer is a nice surprise. As a person who has sweaty hands all the time, I didn't believe it's gonna work. But it's actually able to read my fingers without any problems. The iPhone SE couldn't deal with my fingers. It was a source of a lot of frustrations and one of a few major reasons why I switched to iPhone X in Feb 2020, which has FaceID (only if the pandemics didn't bring face masks right after that).</p>
<p>It's very comfortable to use TouchID to login to the operating system, to 1Password, or to confirm a purchase in App Store (although that had to be first set up somewhere deep in the System Preferences, bah). Opening 1Password with a single finger touch is definitely a major productivity win for me.</p>
<h3 id="battery">Battery<small><a href="#battery" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>On Wednesday I tested the battery. 9am I unplugged the computer from electricity with 100% battery, and it started complaning about power only around 10pm. That's 13 hours. That said, during that day, I did mostly internet stuff, perhaps played some music, had 1 hour long call over MS Teams, 1 hour long call over Google Meet, and from 7pm to 10pm I attended an online meetup over Zoom. Before I connected to the meetup at 7pm, it still had almost 30 % battery left. Of course, no fan sound, as the machine has no fan, and it was only lukewarm between the keyboard and the display, cold everywhere else. Amazing!</p>
<h3 id="games">Games<small><a href="#games" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>On Black Friday I bought <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, but it would crash on my machine. On the Apple Silicon Air, even though I run the game through Rosetta 2, I've put all the sliders in the performance settings to the highest positions, and it runs so smooth that when moving the game camera I actually experience problems to get my head around so many details happening on my screen. It's beautiful. Of course, the machine makes no sound, as it has no fan.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://applesilicongames.com/">list of games which are optimized</a>, but I just installed Steam using Rosetta 2, downloaded the games I wanted through it, and didn't bother further.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup<small><a href="#setup" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew<small><a href="#homebrew" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>Setting up and figuring up Homebrew was a major drag, especially because my connection isn't very fast and initializing Homebrew downloads a lot of stuff over git, so it's endless. Before I found out the ideal configuration, I had to do it several times. I don't like Apple Store very much, so I only use it for installing apps which are not available as Homebrew casks, e.g. <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/lungo">Lungo</a>. I install everything else using Homebrew.</p>
<p>Homebrew suggests using it through Rosetta 2 (translation layer), which is fine, but I wanted to be able to also install apps which are already native to Apple Silicon. People post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM">tutorials on how to have two Homebrew installations side by side</a>, but it still took me some time to figure everyhting out. My setup after some trial and error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't bother installing CLI apps natively. <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">It's a mess now</a> and you'll only run into issues. Unless you want to help the Homebrew team with debugging, of course.</li>
<li>I ended up having the default Homebrew installed through Rosetta 2, and I install everything with it, both CLI and GUI apps,</li>
<li>except GUI <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">apps which are already optimized for the new Macs</a>, such as Firefox, Spotify, VS Code, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow the common advice on how to install Rosetta 2 Homebrew and how to install the native one. I won't repeat the many already existing tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM">Install Homebrew Natively on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac</a> (see also comments)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/mikelxc/Workarounds-for-ARM-mac">Workarounds for ARM-based Apple-Silicon Mac</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of my setup are that I have this in my <code>.bash_profile</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Three years ago, Jo and his wife Robin shared their story: he had early-onset Alzheimer's. Now, as it continues its swift, relentless assault on Jo, Robin navigates the unthinkable</p><div>
																		<p>Robin Giles is waiting at the entrance of her London, Ont., apartment building when the little white bus pulls up at the curb. The door to the lift swings open to reveal her husband, Joël Aubin, sitting in his wheelchair, grinning broadly at her. His arms undulate through what looks like a slow-motion drumming routine, and he snaps his ﬁngers continuously.</p>
<p>The wheelchair lift has jammed, and after the bus driver makes several attempts to get it working, she asks Robin if she can get Jo—as he’s known to most everyone in his life—off the bus without his chair. “We can <em>try</em>,” Robin says.</p>
<p>She climbs aboard, takes Jo’s hands in hers and coaches him to stand and follow her down the aisle. As is nearly always the case when Robin is within range, Jo’s gaze rarely strays from her. She backs down the bus steps and talks him down them one at a time. It takes Jo a couple of tries to climb the high curb, then he settles into the wheelchair the driver has extracted through the rear door.</p>
<p>Jo turns to Robin. “Holy s–t!” he exclaims. Robin and the bus driver roar with laughter.</p>
<p>This is the routine—minus the glitch with the lift and Jo’s perfect comedic expletive—every weekday around 3 p.m. During the school year, when Robin is teaching, her dad meets the bus every day when Jo returns from a day program, and Robin comes home soon after.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Jo was diagnosed with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, an extremely rare form caused by a genetic mutation slithering through his family tree. Jo watched his mother die of the same illness when he was a teenager. Even in this early-onset form of Alzheimer’s, Jo is a terrible rarity: <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html">he was 37 years old when he was diagnosed.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ THE FIRST STORY ABOUT JO: <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html">Jo Aubin has Alzheimer’s. He’s 38.</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Jo is 41 and Robin is 40, and they are navigating unthinkable territory. The “bastard monster,” as Robin sometimes calls Alzheimer’s, has been swift and relentless, but the assault has been particularly vicious in the last six months. Jo’s ability to speak has all but disappeared, his mobility is reduced to a slow, assisted shuffle around their apartment, and he requires hands-on help with every task of daily life, from dressing and brushing his teeth to eating and safely sitting down in a chair.</p>
<p>So far, with the help of her family, the day program and the sheer force of her own will and devotion to Jo, Robin has managed to provide all his caregiving at home. Families of people with dementia land in different places on this issue, but to her, it’s beyond question that Jo is not here anymore; most everything that made him Jo has been stolen. “But it’s almost like an echo that’s left,” she says. “It’s like I want to take care of <em>this</em> Jo because it’s honouring the real Jo.”</p>
<p>When she’s forced to move Jo into a nursing home and Robin loses her ability to care every day for the echo of the man she married, that will mean he’s really gone. “Sometimes people very kindly say, ‘Oh, it will be better when Jo is living somewhere else.’ No, it won’t. That’s the part that people don’t understand. It won’t be better. It will be the worst part,” she says through sobs. “Because I don’t consider what I’m doing a negative thing.”</p>
<p>But Robin knows a reckoning is imminent. And she also knows, because they talked about it many times before Jo lost the ability to have those conversations, that he despised the idea of going into a nursing home. In recent months, Robin felt compelled to put Jo on two waiting lists, but what haunts her is that he still seems so aware, she can’t imagine wrenching him from the peaceful, comfortable world they’ve built around him at home. There are still those fleeting moments—like his response to the ordeal of navigating the bus steps—when the old Jo resurfaces and announces himself with surprising clarity.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to the bus driver, Robin guides Jo’s wheelchair onto the elevator and pushes the button for their floor.</p>
<p>“He’s not ready to go anywhere yet,” she says. She looks at Jo, then reaches over and ruffles his hair.</p>

(Photograph by Chris Donovan)</p></div>
<p>More than two years before Jo was diagnosed, bizarre little glitches began to suggest something was terribly wrong. There were Christmas gifts that made no sense, problems with software he’d used for years or basic household tasks that went ignored. He saw his family doctor repeatedly, but medication and counselling—based on the assumption that the problem was depression or anxiety—went nowhere. Eventually, Jo was less able to teach high school—he was working at the same school as Robin—and their marriage frayed.</p>
<p>Finally, Jo’s doctor referred him to a specialist, and in June 2014 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. A year after his diagnosis, <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html"><em>Maclean’s</em> chronicled his story to that point.</a> Jo—so articulate that it had always been a running joke among his friends—struggled slightly to make words do his bidding, but he explained what it was like to live with dementia. “It’s kind of like you’re going through a forest,” he said. “And the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Jo was adamant that he didn’t want to end up in a long-term care facility like the one in which he’d visited his mother—sometimes with Robin along for the ride when they began dating as teenagers in Kapuskasing, Ont.—and he hoped that Canada’s legalization of assisted death would allow him to avoid that. But when medical assistance in dying became law in 2016, excluded were “advance requests” that would have permitted people with dementia to set out terms for their death while they still had capacity to consent.</p>
<p>Now, that dark forest Jo described is closing in. “In a lot of ways, it’s good that you don’t know what was coming, because if you knew, you would probably run away screaming,” Robin says. “But like everything else, it’s a progression where you look back and think, ‘I don’t know how we got here.’ ”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/politics/assisted-death-the-the-difficulties-around-demnetia/">The case for advance directives in assisted dying</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>She thinks of life in chapters divided by school years. Last fall, Jo’s mobility was fine, and they could still go to the movies or grocery shopping, though she had to ensure he stayed with the cart. He could no longer speak in full sentences then, but he could tell her his preference if she gave him options.</p>
<p>Now, Jo’s communication is mostly reduced to quiet, monosyllabic responses to yes-or-no questions, along with the occasional full phrase, often in humorous contexts. This spring, he began to use a wheelchair at the day program and on the bus, because he was having trouble navigating steps and had fallen occasionally when he misjudged the location of a chair.</p>
<p>Mostly, Jo looks like any guy in his early 40s and just like he always has, because even as he’s had to switch to comfortable clothing with no buttons or zippers, Robin has stuck close to his personal style; his wardrobe is still heavy on band T-shirts. But there’s a sort of veil in his gaze now and a relaxed softness in his facial features. When Instagram or Timehop present Robin with old photos, she can see some important source of light in Jo that’s gone now. A trip to the beach two years ago seemed ordinary, but when the photo appears, she can remember the day vividly: a postcard from another world where such things were possible. “It’s pretty devastating,” she says. “But also it’s nice to remember those times.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1145941"><p><img data-sizes="auto" src="https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MAC09_JO_HAS_ALZHEIMERS03.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="810"></p><p>Jo is fed lunch at McCormick Home. (Photograph by Chris Donovan )</p></div>
<p>Doctors often use the term “insight” to discuss whether a person with dementia is aware of their condition; some people come in for an appointment furious at a spouse who keeps insisting they’re losing track of things when they’re sure they’re not. Jo was acutely aware of his illness early on, and he and Robin talked about it often. “He was just frustrated by the hand he was dealt, and he was always, always worried about being a burden,” Robin says. “We would tell him, ‘You’re not.’ ” Jo stopped having those conversations about a year ago.</p>
<p>Robin has continued to work full-time out of financial necessity and to maintain a little island of normalcy with a job she loves. There are two big reasons she’s been able to do that and still care for Jo at home: the McCormick Dementia Services day program, and her father, Kip Giles. “I literally don’t know what I would do without him,” Robin says.</p>
<p>Three years ago, she called him in Kapuskasing and asked if he would consider moving in with them for the school year. “I immediately responded within a second or two, ‘Sure, of course,’” Kip says. Robin’s mother, Kathy, had died of complications from heart problems and pneumonia in January 2015, so Kip was on his own, and his reasoning for immediately saying yes matches Robin’s explanation for her devotion to Jo: when your family is in trouble, you’re there—that’s it. “Why sit up here, 1,100 km away and be by myself, when I know my daughter needs my help?” Kip says. “Realizing that I was going to be able to help in any way that I could made me feel like a parent.”</p>
<p>One of the first times Kip met Jo was shortly after he and Robin started dating in high school, when there was a party going on next door. “I wouldn’t say he was completely inebriated, but he stumbled in the front door,” Kip says, chuckling. “My wife and I both turned and said, ‘Oh yeah?’” Jo’s home life was rough, so he more or less moved in with Robin’s family.</p>
<p>Now, each fall when Kip returns to London after spending the summer at home, it’s jarring to see the changes. His first reaction is always anger at what’s happening to Jo, though he keeps it to himself. One of Robin’s frequent refrains is, “It is what it is.” And Kip thinks …</p></div></div>

      Conventional wisdom says that startup equity is worthless. While most startups fail, there’s a chance your equity will become a life-changing pot of money. This guide explains how to make the most of your equity. 
    </p>
   
</section></div><h3>Let’s start with an example.</h3><div><section>    <p>
Suppose you join a Series A startup as the fifteenth employee. A few months in, and you’re feeling incredibly optimistic. Customer demand is skyrocketing; you can’t seem to build quickly enough to meet their needs. The startup has added six new employees since you joined and is frantically recruiting more—you’re already a “senior employee!” </p>
   
    <p>
You’ve been offered the opportunity to “early exercise” all of the stock options you’ve been granted. This will cost you $40,000. 
</p>
    <p>
It sounds expensive (and it is!) but say that, two years from now, your company reaches a billion dollar valuation—it’ll then cost you upwards of $400,000 to exercise this same tranche of stock options and cover all of the tax obligations. 
</p>
    <p>
Silicon Valley is full of stories where startup employees miss out on material tax savings, on the order of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars, because they ignored their equity compensation until it was too late. This guide helps you strategically maximize your upside as an early startup employee at a fast-growing company.
</p>
   
</section></div></div><div><h3>Deciding to exercise</h3><div><section>


    <p>
      Exercising your stock options represents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment in your company. At a high level, here are the pros and cons of making such an investment: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pros</b>    </p>

      
      <p>With the 409A rising, you’re incentivized to exercise 
        <span>sooner rather than later.<label for="sn-srtl"></label></span>
        
        <span>Furthermore, your options do expire eventually, so you can’t put off exercising them indefinitely.</span>
        This will kickstart the long-term capital gains clock and break your 
        <span>golden handcuffs.<label for="sn-goldenh"></label></span>
        
        <span>The term golden handcuffs refers to compensation incentives that discourage you from leaving your company. While your equity may pose a large reward, if you cannot afford to exercise it, you’re monetarily encouraged to stay at your company until at least the IPO.</span>
        </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cons</b>    </p>

      <p>Investing capital into stock directly tied to your single source of income greatly increases your overall concentration in a risky, illiquid asset.</p>
     
      <p><b>To answer the question of whether or not you should exercise, consider the following: </b></p>
      
</section></div><h4>1. Your liquidity constraints<br></h4><div><section>
       <p>Your liquidity constraints will limit the number of options that you are able to exercise. To determine these constraints, audit your personal finances. Consider metrics such as your current liquidity, movable assets, near-term liabilities, and financial goals.</p>
       <p>Cash flow timing plays an important role, as startups often take 5-10 years to exit (if ever). Investing in your startup therefore comes with a significant opportunity cost: you could deploy this same capital into other opportunities (e.g., public stocks or real estate) that could generate steady, dependable returns over the course of those 5-10 years. You’re really looking to come up with a projected, probabilistic return on investment for exercising your stock options (and compare that to your broader financial picture).</p>

Your view of the company<br></h4><div><section>
        <p>In deciding how much of stock to purchase, you are essentially quantifying your level of optimism in your company. While you’re unlikely to have access to every line-item on your company’s income statement, you do likely have access to key figures (e.g., revenue trends) to inform your analysis. In the end, you need to form your personal investment thesis—Why will your company win? What will prevent you from succeeding? What’s the best case scenario?</p>
        <p>At the same time, keep in mind that even startups with the most seemingly promising trajectories can stumble. WeWork is an obvious example: in early 2019, it was valued at $47 billion and was filing for an IPO. By the end of the year, its valuation had dropped to $8 billion. Pebble went from a $740 million valuation in 2015 to $40 million by 2016. Juul went from $38 billion in 2018 to $12 billion in 2020. Employees who exercised their options at the higher valuations fell out of the money (and overpaid in taxes).</p>

</section></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val.png" loading="lazy" width="720" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 88vw, 53vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val.png 1440w" alt=""></p><h3>Deciding</h3><div><section> 
<p>
     To quantify this decision, let’s explore another example. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have 100,000 options, with a strike price of $1
      </li>
      <li>
        The current 409A valuation is $1.20
      </li>
      <li>
        The 409A in 3 years will be $20
      </li>
      <li>
        In 5 years, your company will IPO, and each share will be worth $100
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here are the various strategies you can try: 
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      
      <li>
       Early exercise everything now
      </li>
      <li>
       Exercise all options in 3 years
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait until the IPO to exercise
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The table below estimates the hypothetical costs of exercising now, in 3 years, and in 5 years.
    </p>
</section></div><p>You can scroll right on the table above →</p><div><section>    
<p>
Importantly, these projections assume a successful outcome for your company and don’t account for relevant factors such as dilution, timing, and liquidation preferences. Early exercising performs worse than doing nothing in the event your startup fails. Exercising your stock options is making an investment in your company. You are betting on its future performance and if it fails, you will lose your principal investment. Consults your financial and tax advisors to make the right decision.
</p>
   
</section></div><h3>Liquidity</h3><div><section>    <p>
Deciding when to exercise is also a matter of timing. How soon do you need liquidity? It’s often possible to sell some of your equity before your company goes public (or gets acquired).    </p>
   
</section></div><h4>Tender offers<br></h4><div><section>
    <p>
From time to time, your company may hold what’s called a tender offer. In a tender offer, some  cohort of shareholders are given the opportunity to sell their shares for a set price per share. Most companies irregularly hold tender offers (once every couple of years), and generally restrict them to current employees who’ve reached some level of tenure. Deciding whether or not to opt-in the tender offer has trade-offs—every share you sell is potentially worth more (or less) in the future.     </p>
</section></div><h4>Secondary markets<br></h4><div><section>
    <p>
A number of secondary markets make it possible to sell shares to independent investors. There are also funds and brokerages designed to help you get financing to exercise your options. It’s not guaranteed that you’ll be able to participate in either of these vehicles; it depends on factors such as transfer restrictions, timing, and demand from investors.
</p></section></div><h3>Conclusion</h3><div><section>
    <p>
No matter what, early-stage startups are inherently risky. You could end up with a life-changing pot of money in five years, or your equity could end up being worthless. Furthermore, along the way, funding rounds and 409A re-evaluations can occur and change your financial situation at any time without warning. In light of this risk and uncertainty, it’s crucial that you take an active role in managing your equity strategically from the start.</p></section></div><div><p>This material presented on Compound’s Resources blog is for informational purposes only and<br>should not be construed as legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

	<p><i>December 18th 2020</i></p>

	<p>Building tiny projects in my free time is something that I love to do.</p>

	<p>My main goal is to test out ideas that I note down in my phone. Sometimes they work and I make a bit of money, but usually they don’t. Either way, it's a fun hobby.</p>

	<p>Recently I was lucky enough to sell a tiny website I'd built. Although the sale was small, the experience was great.</p>

	<p>The process of selling a website had always been a mystery to me. Therefore, in this post I'll tell you what it was like to sell a tiny project, and how I think anyone can.</p>

	<h3>🛠️ 1. Building a Project</h3>

	<p>Back in June, I built <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a>. It's a micro online store builder that lets you create a page to sell a single item on repeat.</p>

	<p>I hacked it together over two weeks, launched it, and wrote about the process. It was a basic MVP with nothing really fancy about it.</p>
	
	<p>To my surprise, a few hundred users created stores, and I even made a staggering £1.64 in revenue through the 1% cut I took on every sale.</p>

	<p>People were selling t-shirts, hats, poems; you name it. One guy even started a store to sell his soul. I saw some very interesting things.</p>

	<h3>👨‍💼 2. Meeting the Buyer</h3>

	<p>My online following is pretty small, but when I type up a blog post like this, people check out the projects I've built.</p>

	<p>One morning I received this email from such a person:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Tiny Projects,</p>
		<p>.. Anyway, it got me thinking about your One Item Store, and actually, I'm wondering if you have any interest in selling it.</p>
		<p>No pressure, but if you are open to it please let me know and I can make you an offer.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Part of me wanted to keep working on this project, but deep down I knew that I didn't have the drive. Besides, I was really interested to know what the offer was:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Buyer,</p>
		<p>I would definitely be open to offers if you were interested in taking it off my hands, especially as you've been following along Tiny Projects for a while.</p>
	</div>

	<p>A few hours later I got an offer.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Tiny Projects,</p>
		<p>Glad to hear you're open to the idea.  Would you consider <b>$4000</b> for it?</p>
	</div>

	<h3>⚔️ 3. Negotiating a Price</h3>

	<p>Was this a good price for a tiny project? How do you even value something like this?</p>

	<p>After doing some back of the envelope math, I sent back a counter-offer:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Buyer,</p>
		<p>.. With a bit of a polish up and some better store designs, One Item Store could have some potential. However, I'd personally be keen to sell and focus on other things. Would you consider <b>$7,500</b> for it?</p>
	</div>

	<p>We went back and forth with offers over the next few days:</p>

	<div>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> As for the price, how about <b>$4800</b>?</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> Would you be willing to meet me at <b>$6,500</b>?</p>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> The upper limit of my budget for this is <b>$5,000</b>.</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> If you met me at <b>$5,300</b> (£4,000), you have a deal.</p>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> Ok, you got a deal at <b>$5,300</b> :D</p>
	</div>

	<p>My price dropped, but I was happy and ready to cash out of the e-commerce world.</p> 

	<p>The buyer was also a talented developer &amp; really nice guy, with a good idea of how he wanted to integrate One Item Store into his <a href="https://initialcommit.com/" target="_blank">own website.</a></p>

	<h3>💸 4. Money For Code</h3>

	<p>How do you securely exchange code for cash?</p>

	<p>Although it would've been hilarious to do this transaction through a store on One Item Store, we decided instead to use an escrow service.</p>

	<p>It worked like this:

	</p><ul>
		<li>Buyer transfers $5,300 to the escrow service.</li>
		<li>I transfer the domain name, users, and Github repository to the buyer.</li>
		<li>Brief video call explaining the code.</li>
		<li>Buyer has 7 days to try everything out.</li>
		<li>Escrow service transfers $5,300 to me.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>That was it, the deal was done.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions</h3>

	<p>I'm aware that I wouldn't have sold this project if I didn't have a small audience.</p>

	<p>It's made me realise there's this really fun strategy for any developer trying to make money on the internet:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Build things you enjoy</li>
		<li>Write about the process</li>
		<li>Attract a small audience</li>
		<li>Attract opportunities (buyers, customers, job offers)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It's that simple. Code something for a few weeks, then type up how it went. Maybe publish it on your own blog like this.</p>

	<p>Five people will probably read it, and that's awesome. Next time it might be ten!</p>

	<p>Keep building lots of little things that pique your interest, talk about it, and great things will start happening.</p>

  </header>

  <p><em>This is the story of how I prepared for a decade to graduate in 3 months.</em></p>
<p>In 2012, I dropped out of college, where I was studying computer science, after just one semester. I already knew how to program and I thought I’d never need a degree.</p>
<p>Over the years, I found myself complaining a lot about it. I saw many opportunities, especially abroad, that were out of reach because I didn’t have the required papers. I felt ready for graduate school but couldn’t get admitted. I had to work harder to prove myself to employers. Although I never noticed any serious gap in my knowledge, I felt that something was missing. I started to resent my decision.</p>
<p>In June 2020, I attended a virtual <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a> meetup. As usual, I complained about not having a degree. This is when I first heard about <strong><a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a></strong> (WGU). Apparently, their online programs had <a href="https://sive.rs/kimo">no speed limit</a> and students could graduate as quickly as they could pass all the exams. I was skeptical, so I did some research.</p>
<p>Here’s what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s accredited</strong>. Their programs are accredited by the <a href="https://www.nwccu.org/">Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)</a>, the same accreditation body used by the University of Washington (#24) and the University of Oregon (#94).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s self-paced</strong>. Their competency-based approach allows students to complete courses as quickly as they can show mastery of the material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s affordable</strong>. Their flat-rate tuition of $3,200 per 6-month term means that the faster you complete the degree, the more money you save.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed too good to be true. I immediately submitted my application.</p>
<p>The next day, I received a phone call from an enrollment counselor. They confirmed everything I had read and told me that although they didn’t officially accept foreign students (I’m Canadian), they would try to make an exception. After a dozen phone calls, transfer/translation/evaluation of transcripts, proof of English proficiency, and tuition payments, I was officially enrolled in their <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program</a>.</p>
<p>I now had the opportunity to apply everything I had learned from <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">Scott H. Young’s MIT Challenge</a>, in which he completed MIT’s 4-year CS curriculum in just 12 months. Of course, my achievement wouldn’t be as impressive, given WGU’s less rigorous program and my prior experience in the field. Indeed, I wrote my first program at 10, I had years of professional experience as a software developer, and I had even studied the subject in college. Still, I would get a real CS degree in just 3 months.</p>

<p>In this post, I will take you through my entire academic journey, describing when, where, and how I completed each of the 34 courses (120 credits) required for this degree. Note that credits awarded for the first 3 courses (9 credits), taken between 2009 and 2012, were excluded from the quoted 3 months and $5000 total. “How I Got a Computer Science Degree in 11 Years for More Than $5000” didn’t sound right.</p>
<p><em>When consulting the tables below, “CUs” stands for “Competency Units”, which is WGU’s time-agnostic equivalent to “Credit Hours”. “Effort” represents the total amount of time (in hours) invested in a given course, from initial research to final assessment.</em></p>
<h2 id="cégep-édouard-montpetit-2009-2012">Cégep Édouard-Montpetit (2009-2012)</h2>
<p>From 2009 to 2012, I studied IT at Cégep Édouard-Montpetit and graduated with a Diploma of College Studies, which is roughly equivalent to an Associate’s degree in the US. From there, a Bachelor’s degree typically requires an additional 3 years of study.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with the program, other than mandatory class attendance, was its focus on Microsoft technologies: Visual Studio, C#, <span>ASP.NET</span>, SQL Server, IIS, etc. I was a die-hard Linux user who wrote essays about the evil of proprietary software in high school. Despite my initial resistance, I ended up learning quite a bit. Who knew I would later fall in love with Windows Phone, build a bunch of apps for it (including its first Bitcoin wallet), work as a Xamarin developer, and even spend 3 years porting <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI</a> to Android and iOS (<a href="https://platform.uno/">Uno</a>).</p>
<p>Out of 39 courses, I only managed to transfer 2 courses' worth of credits (6 credits) to WGU. They wouldn’t transfer any IT course. They wouldn’t take my calculus course because it was over 5 years old. Unlike a US Associate’s degree, which would satisfy all of WGU’s general education requirements, my foreign degree wouldn’t. Also, the subject and level of some of the courses were lost in translation, after going through a translation agency (French → English) and an international credential evaluation service (Québec → USA). If I had a recent (less than 5 years old) Associate’s degree, I could have expected to receive 10 courses' worth of credits.</p>

<h2 id="concordia-university-2012">Concordia University (2012)</h2>
<p>In 2012, I studied computer science at Concordia University and dropped out after 1 semester.</p>
<p>On my first day, I attended 2 lectures. I quickly realized that a 2-hour commute to listen to someone slowly recite a PowerPoint wasn’t the best use of my time. Lectures might exist for good reasons, but I wasn’t sophisticated enough to appreciate them. Instead, I read the PowerPoints myself, at home, and used Wikipedia to fill in the gaps. I only set foot on campus 3 more times, to take the midterm and final exams. Although I passed all 4 courses, I felt very confused about this whole university thing, where you spend a lot of time learning very little. So, I dropped out and gave up my scholarship.</p>
<p>Out of 4 courses, I only managed to transfer 1 courses' worth of credits (3 credits) to WGU.</p>

<h2 id="spanstudycomspan-2020"><span>Study.com</span> (2020)</h2>
<p>In July 2020, as I was going through WGU’s admission process, I decided to get a head-start by taking some courses online for academic credits. At that point, I was still hoping to graduate in 12 months (2 terms of 6 months). I figured that the more credits I transferred, the more likely I would complete the program in 2 terms. I still had no idea that 1 term would be more than enough.</p>
<p>Thankfully, US students have access to a lot of affordable options when it comes to taking online courses for credits. These are just a few of the many websites that offer courses with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_on_Education">ACE</a> credits in the $25-$200 per course range:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://study.com/">Study.com</a> ($199/month + $70/course after 2 included courses)</li>
<li><a href="https://sophia.org/">Sophia Learning</a> ($79/month + $0/course)</li>
<li><a href="https://straighterline.com/">StraighterLine</a> ($99/month + $59/course)</li>
<li><a href="https://saylor.org/">Saylor Academy</a> ($0/month + $25/course)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose <a href="https://study.com/">Study.com</a> because they had the largest course catalog (180+) and the most comprehensive transfer agreements with WGU. Their College Acceleration Edition plan costs $199/month and includes 2 exams, on top of which you can add up to 3 additional exams per month for $70 each.</p>
<p>Their courses are not the best I’ve taken, but they get the job done. They’re split into bite-size units, each with animated lectures and mandatory quizzes. The number of quizzes can be overwhelming, and I recommend looking elsewhere if you already know the material and just want to take the final exam. Some courses have projects, and most courses have a proctored final exam. Proctoring is done using your computer’s webcam, but the footage is only reviewed 7-10 days later, which can be a problem if you need to transfer credits quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they limit students to 5 courses per month, which is where I stopped.</p>

<p>On July 29<sup>th</sup>, after reaching <span>Study.com</span>’s monthly 5-course limit, I started looking for alternatives. Luckily, <a href="https://sophia.org/">Sophia Learning</a> had made all their courses free until the end of July due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The quality of their courses is better than average, and you can even choose from multiple lecturers. Courses are broken down into logical units, each with a set of challenges (quizzes) and a milestone (unit exam). Each course ends with a final milestone which is non-proctored (no webcam) and open-book, making them almost too easy.</p>
<p>I managed to complete 3 courses before the promotion ended.</p>

<p>On September 1<sup>st</sup>, I finally started my first and only term at WGU, with 23 courses (83 credits) left to go.</p>
<p>By then, I had already passed 9 pre-assessments (practice exams), which unlike course material were already available before the start of the term. On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months.</p>
<p>It made me realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was much more productive and motivated without an arbitrary speed limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could probably graduate in a single term of 6 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each student at WGU gets assigned a program mentor, who supports them from their first day through graduation. I had a phone call with mine every week, in which we discussed my progress and planned the week ahead. She quickly adapted to my pace of study and made sure I never got stuck waiting for an answer or for the next set of courses to be approved. I never expected that this human point of contact would have such a positive impact on my experience at WGU. Course …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I’ve had an easy time being <em>focused</em> lately. I say no to obligations or opportunities that I would have easily accepted before. I have fewer things on my todo list, which means I get to spend more time on the few things that I’ve said yes to when I sit down to be creative. I also have a stronger sense of my values – what’s important to me, and what’s less important – and that’s helped me leave more room in my schedule for myself. I’ve been thinking about why it’s easier for me to focus now, and what might have changed.</p>
<p>The most significant change in my thinking has been that <strong>I have a lot of conviction now that the few things I’m spending my time on – university, writing, side projects – are right for me.</strong> If a stranger had come up to me last year, told me I was doing it all wrong, and suggested I make different choices in my education or my work, I would have been easily swayed. Today, I feel myself standing on much firmer ground. Because I’m sure that I’m spending my time on the right things, it’s easy for me to say no to things that’ll take that time away from me for something else.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a moment in time when I suddenly decided that I was going to become focused, and started <em>having confidence</em> in what I do. Confidence doesn’t work that way – it’s <em>earned</em>, not <em>found</em>. To earn confidence (and the focus that comes with it), we need to explore our options, try things out, open all the different doors in front of us, and then say, “this is the best option for me, so I’m going to do this.” Only that kind of conviction, coming from true belief and not just blunt willpower, can give you the certainty you need to be focused on the few <em>right</em> things. I suspect this is the reason many students who take gap years or gap semesters return with more confidence and perspective. They’ve explored more of their options, and find themselves more focused.</p>
<p>All this has me convinced that <strong>focus isn’t just stubbornly saying “I’m going to say no to more things,” it’s studying all the options you have until you can say with conviction, “this is the right one for me."</strong> Paradoxically, this means attaining focus requires us to become <em>less focused</em> for a little bit, exploring our options enough to develop some conviction around what’s important or what feels right.</p>
<p>At any moment, we are either in a <em>divergent</em> phase of life, or in a <em>convergent</em> phase. During a divergent period, we’re usually focused on broadening our inputs. We go to school, take on internships, travel, try a career switch, and so on, exploring new paths. During a convergent time, we take what we’ve learned thus far to double down on just a handful of goals on which we can spend our energy – we become more focused. We grow fastest not by converging constantly onto some single point set from the start, but over cycles of divergence and convergence that come and go like seasons.</p>
<p>These cycles of divergence and convergence come from the heart, not from circumstance. You can’t force yourself to become focused by picking an option when you aren’t sure that it’s right. If your choice isn’t based on the confidence you have in that decision, your focus ends up pulled apart by the worry that you’ve missed out on the roads not taken.</p>
<p>Focus is a destination, not a path. And the only way to get there is to earn the confidence to feel that what you’re working on is the right one for you, so you can say no to everything else. And the only way to feel right in what you do is to try your chances with the paths that might be wrong, too. That isn’t wasted effort – it’s what’s required of us to earn our focus.</p>
<p>So if you feel lost or directionless, instead of making yourself pick a direction while lost at sea, consider drifting for a bit. Try things out. Open the unopened doors. Say yes to a few more things. And then when you feel the winds turning, set your sail to what feels right, indisputably and confidently right. It might take more time, and you might feel behind sometimes, but when you finally set off, you won’t need to look back.</p>

<p>2020 was actually a first-class year for technological innovation, but it will probably also go down in history as the year of the ultimate frustration of discouraged consumers, when the target group will end up not being able to buy what has been on their wish list for a long time: graphics cards and processors, power supplies and last but not least the ready-made solution in the form of the current consoles such as a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Why is such a shortage arising in the first place? The big brands that are ultimately at stake (Sony, Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD) all talk about “demand exceeding supply”. Oh, really?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1024x491.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="491" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1024x491.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-768x368.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-990x475.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1320x633.jpg 1320w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU.jpg 1766w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>It is a rather evasive explanation, without any communication about the actual state of their supply and production lines. Every company, regardless of its size, also employs highly experienced specialists who plan production and procurement for the long term and create a so-called forecast, which is nothing more than a complex foresight that takes all factors into account. It is certainly possible for a company to miss the mark, as the example of AMD and Vega shows, where in the end they forgot to plan the packaging in advance with sufficient resources. But that suddenly everyone is supposed to be equally wrong is then rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Of course, one can go in search of causes and traces, exchange ideas with colleagues, tap and evaluate various own sources and also include the findings of other specialized media, which often have incomparably better access to the makers behind the scenes. The first conclusion that could be drawn fairly quickly is the common statement of almost everyone that the situation is really serious at the moment and will continue at least until spring 2021, because its causes are manifold and more complex than many company representatives would like to communicate publicly. In the end it is a causal chain, where all the imponderables and shortcomings also impressively show the negative side of globalisation.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The explosion of demand exists, but is not the only reason</strong></span></h3>
<p>The explosive growth in demand for various IT products is undeniable. First of all because of teleworking in the home office: printers and laptops are sold well and one of the leading providers of webcams even reported a historic sales record. On the gaming side, 2020 will see the most attractive market launch in a long time, driving new customers and upgraders into the shops in equal measure. Consoles like the PS5 or Xbox Series X, graphics cards like NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3000 or AMD’s RX 6000, new CPUs like the Ryzen 5000 series and finally, of course, box office hits like Apple’s M1 are fuelling a hype that is leading to a shortage of supply, as many interested parties would like to take the performance leaps (which have not been seen for several years) with them.</p>
<p>One of the largest suppliers of graphics cards explains that orders for the GeForce RTX 3000 from resellers are much higher than last year. Although the cards go out like hot cakes when they arrive, it is also explained that there are no more availability problems in relation to the number of pieces requested than in previous years. The same is also true for manufacturers of stationary gaming PCs and system integrators, who would have RTX 3000 graphics cards at their disposal, for example, but the demand is indeed greater than estimated and more and more mass retailers are entering this market, skimming off large quantities. As a result, even graphics cards of earlier generations are now affected by lack of availability. At AMD, Ryzen 4000 as a notebook CPU is becoming scarce, as is Ryzen 5000, so many manufacturers are now even switching back to Ryzen 3000. And as for AMD’s new RX-6000 series, AMD itself is talking about a transition period of up to eight weeks before it expects to meet the demand for board partner cards.</p>

<h3><span><strong>Transport problems as a historical crisis that causes additional damage</strong></span></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, traffic has been out of control and panic has been rampant. But now, at the end of 2020, the situation is even worse than in spring. For example, an industry expert working for one of the leading providers of international transport services describes this unprecedented situation as “the biggest crisis ever” in transport between Asia and the rest of the world. Prices for container transport are also skyrocketing through the United States of America, which is attempting to monopolise most sea and air transport in order to import massive amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE) in addition to conventional goods.</p>
<p>Europe must therefore pay an ever higher price for its share in order to recover the lost transport capacity: the price has risen from around 2,000 to over 6,000 dollars for a single container, and only for pure port-to-port delivery. The same applies to air transport. A Chinese exporter explains that chartering a Boeing 747 today costs a whopping million dollars, compared to about 400,000 dollars as used to be the case. This is simply because you have to pay for the return flight of the plane, which is very likely to be empty, since there is currently a very large imbalance in the import-export market between China and Europe.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the price per kilo for air transport has doubled worldwide and Europe is increasingly resorting to the new Silk Road, which China has pushed very hard: conventional road and rail transport, the prices of which have even tripled in the meantime! Especially bulky peripherals, such as PC screens, are also suffering greatly: according to a well-known brand, prices rose by 15 or 25% in France, for example. According to the information, some computer components, sometimes even graphics cards, are now sent to Europe without their packaging as so-called “bulk goods” in order to save volume: they are packed into cartons on arrival later, if at all. Dead on Arrival? Not to be ruled out, which then causes even more frustration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_155103" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155103"><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1024x581.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1536x872.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-2048x1163.jpg 2048w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-187x105.jpg 187w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-990x562.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1320x749.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-155103">Delivery from the online retailer without any cardboard box (igor’sLAB Forum)</figcaption></figure>
<p>
But on the transport side, even the deadline for technological products, which are often small, light and of high quality, remains a constant issue. Because the real problem at the moment is the lead time: it takes about 4 to 5 weeks to get transport space at all, which is four times longer than normal. By road and rail, crossing certain borders between China and Europe now takes an average of 10 days, whereas it used to take 3 days. This is pretty bad timing in the middle of the Christmas season and this delay will continue until at least next March according to sources.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Production as a taboo subject with serious consequences</strong></span></h3>
<p>The manufacturing industry is also currently in a historically difficult situation. The manufacturers of various products such as processors, motherboards or graphics cards officially do not appear to be overly concerned about this, but unfortunately the reality often looks completely different, as the entire production chain is, for various reasons, sometimes extremely disrupted (broken chain). First of all, the Taiwanese foundry TSMC is completely overwhelmed by the demand. The reason is actually quite simple: With the exception of the current RTX 3000 (Samsung), all market launches of the year 2020 rely on the 7-nm chips from TSMC. ARM-SoC manufacturers such as Qualcomm also use 7 nm and have only recently moved capacity from Samsung to TSMC. TSMC is currently pretty much alone in the market with this technology and the production lines are therefore working at full capacity. A sudden increase in production is therefore not possible.</p>
<p>A special insulating film, the so-called ABF substrate (Ajinomoto Build-up Film), which is indispensable for etching chips in 7 and 5 nm, has also become increasingly scarce and scarce in recent months. The prices for this film are said to have risen by 40% and the waiting time is said to have increased to up to 4 months. If manufacturers are now declaring that the shortage is likely to continue for a long time to come, it is also because the few suppliers of ABF substrate, such as Unimicron, Kinsus or Na Ya, are declaring that they will not be able to increase their production for another three quarters.</p>
<p>Other components make things even more complicated: The small additional chips (controller, supervisor, etc.) from ST Micro, NXP or Infineon are also missing due to another deficiency: silicon wafers with 8 inch diameter. Many products then suffer from this, such as PC power supplies, but also consoles of the PS5 and Xbox series X and the graphics cards. Flash memory and DRAMs, on the other hand, do not seem to be in real short supply, and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are not as drastic as is often claimed, as the unaffected production capacities are now back to full capacity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1024x572.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1536x858.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-470x264.jpg 470w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-414x232.jpg 414w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-215x120.jpg 215w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-187x105.jpg 187w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-990x553.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1320x737.jpg 1320w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>The political situation between China and the USA makes the situation even worse. Many Chinese productions are blocked by American trade restrictions, which makes the logistics of component assembly very difficult. Trade between China and Taiwan, which used to be very fluid and easy, is now becoming increasingly delicate and difficult. If some manufacturers are talking about a better situation in February, it is also because they expect a change of the American president and a relaxation of sanctions.</p>
<h3><span>Shortage? Not for all</span></h3>
<p>Not all manufacturers are equally affected. It seems that NVIDIA and Apple have each secured a large amount of ABF substrate thanks to their market position. Apple is on the 5 nm TSMC lines alone with a small chip (119 mm²), which is easier to produce in large quantities. NVIDIA, for its part, avoids bottlenecks at TSMC by producing in 8 nm at Samsung, whose performance remains competitive despite much larger GPUs (392 and 628 mm²). The two giants are doing quite well in this respect. According to our information, the next GeForce RTX 3060 (Ti) …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>Beautiful PCB design has thrived in the past few years. With personal projects and event badges alike, hackers have been pushing the limits of the artistic beauty they can put in their circuit boards.</p>

<p>The community of PCB enthusiasts has experimented with combining colours of silkscreen, copper or ENIG, and solder mask to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/03/22/making-more-of-me-money/" target="_blank">make sweet graphics</a>. They’ve convinced PCB houses to <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/18508-mr-robot-badge/log/64526-how-i-created-the-mr-robot-badge" target="_blank">use multiple layers of silkscreen</a>, have <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/30/hackaday-superconference-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pcb-artwork-with-brian-benchoff/" target="_blank">stamped colours of their own</a>, and have even <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/01/13/the-way-of-the-pcb-artist-how-to-make-truly-beautiful-circuit-boards/" target="_blank">gone multidimensional</a>.</p>

<p>I got hooked on event badges after falling in love with <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/08/14/hands-on-with-the-shacamp-2017-badge/" target="_blank">SHA2017</a>, and have been involved in making badges for a bunch of events ever since. For every new badge we make, we have some innate drive to push the boundary a bit further to what was already done before, both in hardware and what experience it gives its users, and in the aesthetics of the badge.</p>

<p>So naturally, when people asked for the re-production of the ESP32 WiFi LED panel badge a bunch of us had made for CampZone 2019 <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/25/campzone-2019-badge-is-begging-to-become-a-huge-billboard/" target="_blank">that had inkjet printed dithered single-colour graphics</a>, I started thinking about what’s next. Stumbling upon a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20464215" target="_blank">hacker news post</a> that showed full-colour UV inkjet printed PCBs by an Australian company called <a href="https://www.littlebird.com.au/" target="_blank">Little Bird</a>, I was amazed. Even though the limitations of PCB design had previously resulted in super creative art, having full-colour graphics in your toolbox could open up so many more possibilities.</p>

<p>The comments section of the hacker news article showed that apparently UV printing had already been done on PCBs over a decade ago, but I hadn’t seen anyone in the badge scene use it before. So I got cracking with our (amazing!) production partner Norbert of <a href="https://shop.allnetchina.cn/" target="_blank">ALLNET China</a>, and together we started experimenting with printing on our PCBs. Boy, were we in for a ride! In the remainder of this post, I’ll try to summarise all of the things we learned along the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="first-attempts">First attempts</h2>
<p>We first started thinking about getting to full colour prints by using the same dithering technique we had used for CampZone 2019, but now with many colours, because I had no idea how normal UV printing worked. Luckily, my friend Hans (aka “the maker maker”, whom I got to know via Ian of <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/" target="_blank">Dangerous Prototypes</a>) mentioned that industrial UV printers can print on many materials out of the box, including PCBs.</p>

<p>Indeed, after getting some weird looks from a company that normally makes physical store signs with their UV printers, they were happy to put some of our old unpopulated CampZone 2019 PCBs in their printer and turn them into retrowave heaven:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/1st_try.jpeg" alt="Full colour art printed over scrap CZ19 badges"></p>

<p>This initial print used standard CMYK UV ink, plus a separate white UV ink for the whites.</p>

<p>The result looked great, but we hit the same problem others before us had hit: putting printed PCBs in a reflow oven messes with the colours a lot. You might remark that it makes more sense to print on the PCBs after they have been pick&amp;placed and soldered. However, the print accuracy of inkjet printers is a function of the distance between the print jet and the object. Our printer could only move 3mm above the PCB (which was not enough for our components), and even if it could move higher the print quality would be quite bad. So instead we worked on getting the UV ink handle reflowing better.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-making-white-stay-white">Lesson 1: making white stay white</h2>

<p>After reflowing, the boards looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/1st_try_baked.png" alt="UV printed boards with white ink after reflowing"></p>

<p>You’ll notice that all colours become a bit more dim. Red seems to lose more of its edge than green and blue. Most importantly though, the white ink is turned into a nasty aged yellow. Most of the colour changes we could live with, so we didn’t correct for them in our designs (you’ll see later that our final art worked nicely with the reflow process). In general one can try to correct for the changes in their source design, of course.</p>

<p>The whites were totally unacceptable though. It made the badge look old and yucky. We considered diving into the world of different UV inks, and finding a white ink that was more heat tolerant. Then we had a simple realisation: the perfect heat resistant white ink we all know already was simply white soldermask or silkscreen. Because we want to keep the front of the badge black to keep nice contrast, we opted for keeping the mask black and experimented with white silkscreen on the back.</p>

<p>So we modified our art such that the white parts were cut out of the design, which meant no ink would be placed there, and made PCBs that were completely covered with white silk outside of the component pads. The result was awesome, even after reflowing:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/2nd_try_white.jpg" alt="UV ink on white silkscreen after reflowing"></p>

<h2 id="lesson-2-getting-decent-alignment">Lesson 2: getting decent alignment</h2>

<p>At this point we had PCBs that looked nice, but were in no way usable to solder on: many pads were partially printed over.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_pads.jpg" alt="Pads were being partially printed over"></p>

<p>We were printing entire panels at a time, and observed that even when we got perfect alignment on one panel, the next would be wildly out of spec again.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_panel.jpg" alt="Printing whole panels at a time"></p>

<p>It turned out that even though the <em>contents</em> of a panel are extremely dimensionally accurate, the <em>edge rails</em> width was not. PCB houses use alignment holes and markers on the edge rails to align their processes, and don’t need to care if there was ~0.2mm extra width on the rails after such a mark or not.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_rails.jpg" alt="PCB edge rails are not necessarily uniformly cut"></p>

<p>Aside from this, it is in general hard to get sub-mm accuracy on big industrial UV inkjet printers. For future projects, we will at least try to get better repeatability between panels by making a (very thin) jig that is a bit wider and taller than a panel, that has pins on which we slide the alignment holes of the panel. This allows you to fasten the jig to the printbed, and assure that <em>once you have tediously aligned the jig</em> the future panels will print reasonably well.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-3-more-pin-margin--more-better">Lesson 3: more pin margin == more better</h2>

<p>The alignment issue of the previous section was enlarged because we were stubborn. We felt that having close to no whitespace around pads (0.1mm) would look so much better, so literally any misalignment would immediately cause pads to be partially overprinted. It does look incredible in our opinion, but was the cause for a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. We struggled to get our failure rates below 50% (which is ridiculously high; normally we would want &lt;1%).</p>

<p>This makes the <a href="https://pixel.curious.supplies/" target="_blank">Founder’s Edition</a> extra special, as it is highly likely our last project that will have this insanely tight printing margin!
<img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pixel_badge_back.png" alt="Full colour art on the Pixel Badge"></p>

<p>For future projects, we will probably use a ~1mm margin around pins to make our life easier. For making this margin less apparent, we’ll likely incorporate the underlying mask or silk colour in the design. That way you’re not looking at chunks of white across the board :)</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>

<p>By sharing what we did, we hope to make you all excited about getting full-colour art on your designs. We’d be super psyched especially to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=badgelife" target="_blank">#badgelife</a> community pick up this neat trick for other event badges.</p>



<p>And, if you’re still looking for something to do this Christmas and like WiFi-enabled LEDs you can program in Python: you can still get one of our <a href="https://pixel.curious.supplies/" target="_blank">Pixel Badges here</a>. Happy holidays!</p>

December 17, 2020 | https://micromdm.io/blog/big-sur-softwareupdate/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://micromdm.io/blog/big-sur-softwareupdate/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><br><span>Date: Thu, Dec 17, 2020</span><br><span>Reading Time: 7 minutes</span></p><p>If you work with Apple in some capacity, you know that they’re not very likely to admit mistakes. I’m not aware of Apple publishing postmortems after outages or providing details about known issues. So it’s up to the developer and admin communities at large to help each other learn about outages and potential causes. With the release of macOS 11.1 this week I’ve been debugging a new issue with the Mac software update process, one which will affect most enterprise users. I decided I should write about it and let everyone know what the issue is, workarounds, and how to avoid it. I’ve also been paying close attention to some recent changes to the software update mechanism, so I’ll try to mention them below as well.</p><h2 id="a-macos-11-bug-prevents-upgrades-to-the-next-version">A macOS 11 bug prevents upgrades to the next version</h2><p>After macOS 11.1 was released earlier this week, many users <a href="https://twitter.com/Contains_ENG/status/1339399335298166785">started reporting</a> that they were not able to see the software update. Others reported that they saw it, but were not able to download it. I personally experienced this issue when 11.1 was in beta and filed a case with Apple about it, but then moved on to other problems. When the final release came out this week, there were widespread reports of it on the MacAdmins Slack. Reading through system logs, I as well as other admins were able to find what appears to be the root cause. <strong>Under certain conditions, macOS 11.0.1 and macOS 11.1 hosts are requesting the update server send the 11.0.1 update, instead of requesting the next available one. The server rejects this update as it’s already either installed or older.</strong> This somehow corrupts the state of the software update process, and the update is no longer visible as an option in System Preferences.</p><figure><img src="https://micromdm.io/big_sur_softwareupdate/log.jpg"></figure><h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3><ul><li>The update is visible again immediately after the restart. But it’s unclear if the update can always be installed after it’s visible since the condition that made it fail to download the first time can be triggered again.</li><li>Removing the MDM enrollment profile causes the update to be seen again. I and several others tested this extensively, and it’s definitely the enrollment profile, not some other policy managed by MDM. This is obviously a terrible workaround and I’d hesitate to mention it to users as it could cause security agents to stop working, and countless approval dialogs we’re so familiar with. Not to mention some of you have the MDM enrollment profile as non-removable or users who are not administrators, so they don’t have permission to unenroll. Getting them back enrolled in the MDM might prove to be a challenge too.</li><li>Distributing the full 11.1, and eventually the 11.2 installers.</li></ul><h3 id="can-apple-fix-this-bug-without-manual-intervention">Can Apple fix this bug without manual intervention?</h3><p>Apple is well aware this is a problem now, so I am confident the issue will be addressed in 11.2. Unfortunately, it is a client-side issue affecting both 11.0.1 and 11.1 clients. So there’s not much Apple <em>can</em> do to provide a fix. One potential solution I see is for Apple to detect the wrong request and instead of rejecting the download, offer the right file archive instead. But this is a complex system and it’s unclear if the server-side changes alone are enough.</p><p>Something else Apple could try is to side load a patch through another software update. There’s background configuration and malware removal tools that are likely capable of fixing the issue on the system. But it’s an ugly hack and one I’d personally stay clear of even if the option was available.</p><p>In my opinion, the most likely outcome is that the bug will be fixed in 11.2, but clients that have already upgraded to Big Sur (or any M1 macs you might’ve bought) will have to work around the problem themselves. If we’re lucky Apple will publish a support article and that will be that.</p><h2 id="what-else-you-need-to-know">What else you need to know</h2><p>Big Sur has changed the software update mechanism entirely, especially on Apple Silicon macs. It’s a long time coming and Apple spoke about some of this at WWDC in the MDM and IT sessions, so it shouldn’t be entirely surprising. But a lot was left unsaid for us to discover on our own.</p><ul><li>Combo update packages are <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/17/apple-has-stopped-providing-standalone-installers-for-macos-updates/">no longer published</a> on the Apple website. This might surprise many of you who rely on distributing them. The main reason is that the entire format of the updates has changed, and it’s also no longer possible to install updates without the Mac having access to the internet. The updates must come from Apple, and they must be managed by <code>softwareupdate</code> and related processes on the system.</li><li>On Apple Silicon, third party processes are no longer able to script the <code>softwareupdate</code> command. Running the software update command as a root process now prompts for the administrator password, who also needs to be a secure token user. There are only two possible options for OS updates to be applied; either the human user of the device itself or the MDM process <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-macos/using-secure-and-bootstrap-tokens-apdff2cf769b/1/web/1.0">which has special permission</a>. It might also be possible for the Mac to update itself with the auto-update mechanism, but there are too many bugs right now to observe how well that works. My personal experience is that it doesn’t and I’m greeted with a password prompt to enter the next day…</li><li>Specifying a custom URL for the <code>softwareupdate</code> process to pull updates from is no longer possible. Apple advertised this deprecation for all of last year, so it should surprise no one but it hurts. <a href="https://github.com/wdas/reposado">Reposado</a> was one of several great tools that made it possible to have unstable/beta/stable tracks within an organization.</li><li>—ignore is gone as a flag. It <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/10-15-5-2020-003-updates-changes-to-softwareupdate-ignore/">was gone</a> in 10.15.5 briefly too, so you likely know about this one. This time it’s gone for good and never coming back. An MDM server can delay the client from seeing OS updates for up to 90 days only, but that is the absolute maximum going forward. Even for a future major release like macOS 12. If this is important to you, file feedback for Apple to provide a second deferral option, specific to major version numbers.</li></ul><p>I work with the MDM protocol a lot day-to-day and have been <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/os_update/">testing</a> software updates for a while. I was even <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/wwdc20-what-s-new-in-managing/">optimistic</a> about what it would look like in Big Sur back in June. Apple had promised it’s an entirely new implementation, closer to what is available on iOS and that everything would work better than before. But we’re not off to a good start, and all the concerns I had for several years now are back. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/commands_and_queries">design</a> of OS updates in MDM is brittle, requiring multiple remote procedure calls to accomplish something that was previously done by a few lines of shell scripting. And that would be bad on its own, but the bad design is coupled with a buggy implementation; there are many known issues, besides the one I described above. Unless something drastically changes, we’re likely to see many months, if not years of software update bugs that are entirely out of our control.</p><p>Apple was never particularly great at building systems for the enterprise. But, until recently, the Unix components were available for software developers and system administrators to work with. The end result ended up being that if you made an investment within your organization, macOS was a great experience for end-users. It took a lot of work, but it was all achievable. Today, Apple is no better at developing systems that are required in the enterprise. But the ball is entirely in their court. Apple still makes great tools for consumers, and there will be a demand from employees to provide them with Apple gear. But, if Apple can’t start acting on our collective feedback, the experience of using a Mac in the workplace will quickly become unbearable to most.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Austria on July 30, 1947. Famously, he reached stratospheric levels of notoriety and success in three wholly distinct professional fields: bodybuilding, acting, and politics, culminating in his eight years as the Governor of California.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For the past 73 years, Schwarzenegger has gone by Arnold, Ahnuld, Governator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Austrian Oak</a>, Terminator, Running Man, and dozens of other nicknames. In part because he’s charismatic and there’s nicknames aplomb to describe him, sure.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>But also because his last name is hard to spell. Like, really hard.</strong> We would know, because Water Cooler Trivia participants have spelled Schwarzenegger 255 different ways. And we’ve dug deep to explore that data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>255 different spellings. <a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/feature-emojis"><strong>We don’t grade responses based on spellings</strong></a>, so these are the spellings we’ve accepted as correct. We’ve got the full list of them at the end of this article, but we wanted to dig deeper into the data<br></p><h2>First things first: here’s the trivia question<br></h2><blockquote><strong>“What is the name of the Austrian bodybuilder who has been Mr. Universe three times and Mr. Olympia seven times?”</strong><br></blockquote><p>The answer, as you’ve surely guessed by now, is Arnold Schwarzenegger. We first wrote this question in April 2019, and since then…</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>3,019 different participants</strong> across 306 different groups have submitted a response</li><li><strong>2,681</strong> (89%) of folks got the question correct</li><li><strong>1,616</strong> (60%) of correct responses were spelled correctly [editor’s note: we suspect phone and browser autocorrect software lent a helping hand here]</li><li><strong>255</strong> different spellings of Schwarzenegger during that time<br></li></ul><p>And now, let’s look at the different ways in which Schwarzenegger has been spelled by Water Cooler Trivia participants.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. What are the most common misspellings?</h2><p>When you remove the correct spelling, you are left with 1,060 participants who spelled Schwarzenegger in 254 different ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The most common misspelling is to simply add a <strong>T </strong>after the <strong>R</strong>, a.k.a <strong>Schwartzenegger</strong>. This makes sense, as Schwartz itself is a fairly common German surname. 116 different respondents, 4% of all correct responses, spelled Arnold’s surname with that bonus <strong>T.</strong><br></p><p>Next up was <strong>Schwarzeneger</strong>, which removes a letter rather than adding one, this time removing one of the two <strong>G</strong>s. Again, this matches intuition. Double letters are hard to remember and frequently don’t add anything phonetically to a word. 88 different participants spelled it with this missing <strong>G</strong>, or 3% of all correct responses.<br></p><p>In third place was <strong>Schwarzenager</strong> with 56 people (2% of correct responses) both dropping that same <strong>G </strong>and then also swapping an <strong>E </strong>with a <strong>G. </strong>We get it, spelling is hard.<br></p><p>Below is a chart of the ten most common misspellings, and for the intrepid, here’s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqEL1IZvox3Aypi0YDStZ3QJ2_WuMTPwp7pOJ2batPE/edit#gid=756356712">full list</a> of misspellings.</p><figure id="w-node-73dd971f4f5a-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf08dd766ee0807d28_YMx1QfTHzO6c61u44T5MnhVihFk7AuJUa3aJXoUvDh8sLDYthwp4CYFclY0sUekxH3MYA1U9T9lu0OY0GBnxEtnBW-jUzNYQfk5iRSXSBP2musv3twFKBiNuMHwAPsVhEvrRVvUz.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. Wait, how many letters is it?</h2><p>It’s 14 letters. S-c-h-w-a-r-z-e-n-e-g-g-e-r. But not everyone realized that.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of the 255 total different spellings,&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>169</strong> (66%) had fewer than 14 letters</li><li><strong>24</strong> (9%) had more than 14 letters</li><li><strong>61</strong> (24%) correctly had 14 letters but were spelled incorrectly</li><li><strong>1</strong> (0.4%) correctly had 14 letters and was spelled correctly<br></li></ul><p>The most popular length was 13 letters with 31% of distinct spellings and 13% of all correct responses.</p><figure id="w-node-b1be6443de1a-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf088a2f4f273d8970_jDn-VaUiTJ_o9aGXBHJpAgFsSNJ4qViTLF0n0X5ZsN1kWQFbC7nS7JO88_K3BwfEaYJEkkT60LeNMN6-x7CwXgXXpJPsO7JLx7fPFXYMxPmM2bmSAaVNS0g1ttJBCkZDVdFqo_jX.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. So it starts with an S... then a C… then...</h2><p>Schwarzenegger starts with the letter S. That’s fairly obvious. In fact, of the 255 distinct spellings that accepted as correct, 100% of them started with the letter <strong>S</strong>. However, once you move on to the second letter, <strong>only 58% of the spellings had C as the second letter.</strong><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, the share of “correct” letters in terms of positions descends as you get further in the word, with a few noticeable deviations: interestingly, misspellings tend to correctly guess that the 11th letter is a <strong>G</strong> and the 14th letter is an <strong>R</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><figure id="w-node-3153958d4ef7-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf6ef4066cb3b8bc5a_SVo29XaQjA6jKuUkHuTPk1t2s967m2NoVPJrmpRPCGKe3Hrzg40C8kdhQvOqWkjw_BH_8noZ2ds0YGXkppq-B22DsD0PZ6auFQTHvSlEjpjzYw7r1Htdz5sFgWl7oAdN6pVAGp-6.png" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Double Letters</h4><p>On that topic, Schwarzenegger has a double letter in it: two G’s as the 11th and 12th letter. This was a common source of misspellings, as 1<strong>47 of the distinct spellings (58%) guessed that there was only one G</strong> in the politician’s surname.<br></p><h4>Edit Distance</h4><p>Known as edit distance or Levenshtein distance, this is a measure of how many changes you need to make to a word or phrase in order to translate it into another word or phrase. <strong>So “bake” has a distance of one from “cake” or “ake” or “baked”.</strong><br></p><p>When you search the internet for <strong>Girrafe</strong> and the search engine asks <strong><em>“Did you mean Giraffe?”</em></strong><em> </em>they are making that guess because your search query only had an edit distance of two from the more common query term <strong>Giraffe</strong>. One deletion (the first <strong>R</strong>) and one insertion (the second <strong>F</strong>) turns your query into the correct word.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So, basically, this is a way to see <strong><em>how bad </em></strong>certain spellings were. Or, more optimistically, how generous we at Water Cooler Trivia are as graders.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Okay, with all that prologue finished, here’s the edit distance stats for the 255 distinct spellings of Schwarzenegger. Note that we are only surfacing the 1,060 responses that were incorrectly spelled.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>34% had an edit distance of only one</strong>!</li><li>And another 28% were only off by two characters!</li><li>18% of misspellings had an edit distance of at least four</li></ul><figure id="w-node-00b9f866edfc-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcfee56eb8449ae2563_Qw6LyfdHxuw1-KuhsN3NFHyHzwr-1PnjCWoBqcc6pBTMNmr1DKqO-LmCkjcwMx-wn3K4inzJcTAnSOQCLQokxfe_psFkS6F8YkA4ohbuvw5kcvg7D9ApQtGulyfaG4kXCjRYgV-r.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. What does Schwarzenegger even mean?</h2><p>I was wondering that too. It turns out the name has Germanic roots, divided neatly into two terms.</p><ul role="list"><li>"schwarzen" means "black"</li><li>&nbsp;"egg" refers to a ridge<br></li></ul><p>So the Governator’s surname <strong>translates most literally into English as Black Ridge</strong>, which happens to be the name of a U.S. <a href="https://www.blackridge.us/"><strong>technology services company</strong></a>.</p><h2>Closing thoughts...</h2><p>Looking to learn about more commonly-misspelled names or commonly-mistaken knowledge?
