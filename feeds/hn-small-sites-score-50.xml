	<p>Looking at Mozilla’s finances, it’s reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla’s deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That’s over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I’ll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft’s troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it’s in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</p>

<p>With the troubles at Mozilla, Google is one step closer to replicating the WeChat and Facebook walled-garden model on the Web. A quick survey a the field of play shows just how far Google has come in capturing the once open Web.</p>

<h2 id="browser-war-is-over">(Browser) War is over</h2>

<p>Chrome’s ability to dictate web standards will only get stronger over time. Safari and Firefox have been able to apply some shame to Chrome on things like disabling third-party cookies, but soon it’ll just be Apple left with a voice.</p>

<p>But Google doesn’t even need Chrome to dictate standards since it controls the Web’s front door. AMP, a technology no one asked for, is now on over 70% of all marketing websites for no other reason than Google said so.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that most people now access the web via mobile devices, 75% of which run Google’s Android.</p>

<h2 id="original-sins">Original Sins</h2>

<p>Two deficiencies have determined the course the Web has taken: lack of native search and lack of native payments.</p>

<p>Lacking native distributed search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web. The Web’s orignal architects were off base on hyperlinks; it turns out people just want to skip right to the answer they’re looking for. There was once the beginnings of an alternative in public bookmarking sites, but social networks came and sucked all the air out of that space.</p>

<p>Lack of a safe and easy way of exchanging funds was a big factor in advertising becoming the dominant business model on the Web. No-charge services became the norm because, for a long time, there was no reasonable way to pay for them. Enter advertising to fill the void. I think it’s safe to say that Google’s AdWords is the dominant advertising platform on the open Web, which means it holds a commanding position in the Web’s finances.</p>

<p>I’m also going to throw in an honorable mention to poor native video support (it is hyper_text_ after all). It’s beating a dead horse to point out that Google also serves up the vast majority of videos streamed on the Web.</p>

<h2 id="so-then">So then…</h2>

<p>So Google controls the Web’s search and video infrastructure. It can and does dictate standards and media formats. It also controls a huge chunk of the revenues available when publishing and selling on the Web. It even controls the operating system and browser through which most people interact with it.</p>

<p>Google’s capture of the Web is a <em>fait accompli</em>. Only legislation will keep the World Wide Web from finally becoming Web by Google (TM).</p>

          <small>8 August 2020</small>


<p>by Greg Vaughn</p>

<p>I’ve noticed changes in how I prefer to develop software since I’ve been
focusing my career on Elixir. It allows me to think bigger thoughts and to
develop with lower friction and less fear. I don’t want to go back.</p>

<h2 id="it-began-with-fault-tolerance">It Began with Fault Tolerance</h2>

<p>Many people are introduced to Elixir because of its focus on concurrency.  Joe
Armstrong even called Erlang a “concurrency oriented” language. (Note: most of
my points are generic to any BEAM language, but my experience comes from an
Elixir perspective, so please excuse bias in my terminology). I find it helpful
to consider concurrency a logical consequence of a more primeval concern: fault
tolerance. Achieving BEAM-style fault tolerance comes from isolated processes
which do not affect any other if they crash, plus a supervisory process being
informed when another process dies.</p>

<p>The core point of processes is to contain the “blast radius” of damage caused
by an error. It just so happens that the isolation qualities that enable that
also make them great candidates for concurrency.</p>

<h2 id="let-it-crash">“Let It Crash”</h2>

<p>When I first heard the “Let It Crash” mantra of the Erlang community, it
sounded crazy based on my prior development exerience. It’s important to
understand that it is not a license for irresponsibility, or that we should not
care about the system crashing. What it is, at the core, is a recognition that
our systems will have errors (even <em>if</em> we write bug-free code, hardware will
bug us eventually) and that with an architecture of managing the “blast radius”
of damage, then little parts of the system crashing are no longer a scary
thing.</p>

<p>Less fear – yes, please! I’ve learned to write my Elixir code with a focus
on “blast radius” as a driver for when to reach for processes. Even in cases where I
don’t need concurrency, I’ll use a process to enclose the damage an error might
cause. I use supervision trees and durable work queues to recover from those
minor crashes of processes.  I’ve learned to prefer upserts over inserts to
allow my logic to be retried safely for greater idempotency. These two ideas
of processes to enclose possible errors plus idempotency have become second
nature to me in any Elixir code I write.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>

<p>This automatic ability to recover from errors changes the complexion of topics
like test coverage enforcement, static types, extensive code reviews, etc. All
those, at heart, are about preventing errors from being introduced in the first
place (yes, I recognize their secondary benefits too). Those are still good
things (I am not advocating irresponsibility), but with the solid safety net of
fault tolerance from BEAM, we are able to look at them from a different
perspective and see that they do add some friction and inertia to delivering
software.  Perhaps we can temper our reliance upon them in favor of greater
delivery speed in some circumstances. Less fear means more freedom to choose.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-thoughts">Bigger Thoughts</h2>

<p>Elixir re-ignited my intellectual interest in software development. I found,
via Erlang and BEAM history in general, a huge body of wisdom in distributed
systems that I can learn from, and new tools in my toolbox of how to think
about software. With processes so lightweight, pervasive, and offering freedom
from fear of crashing, my perspective shifted in exciting ways. If I think I’m
writing a “web application” then my thoughts are immediately limited. I now
think of building systems. I can think bigger thoughts because I have better
abstractions to build them upon.</p>

<p>Some teams are happy to use Elixir to write web applications, to fit it into
their pre-existing microservice deployment model. I urge developers to reach
for those bigger thoughts that fault tolerant lighweight processes enable. You
can consider each process a logical microservice, but you don’t need the
friction of deploying it separately, and serializing to/from json, and
containers, and orchestration, and distributed logging, et.al.  You can deploy an
entire system of millions of interacting logical microservices in a single BEAM
release.</p>

<h2 id="game-changer">Game Changer</h2>

<p>Elixir and BEAM certainly have been a game changer for me. I’m more fearless when I
build systems, and I hope I can share that freedom with others. The BEAM has spoiled
me, but in a good way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Youâ€™ve had a long week but fortunately itâ€™s Friday and things are looking up. After grinding through the day, you stop on the way home to buy groceries for dinner. After getting the necessities, you decide on impulse to buy a dozen cookies. Youâ€™re on a diet, but you reassure yourself that youâ€™ll eat only one, two at most, to celebrate the arrival of the weekend. Once home, you enjoy your celebratory cookies as planned. Two are enough, but despite your best efforts you continue eyeballing those remaining cookies. Wouldnâ€™t they go great with milk? Maybe just one more with a glass? Before you know it, youâ€™ve polished off a dozen cookies and several glasses of milk, and youâ€™re cursing your poor self-control.</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, at least it was fat-free milk. Also, youâ€™re not alone. Research that prompted people to record whatâ€™s happening multiple times a day <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">found</a> that self-control failures are a frequent and common occurrence of everyday life. Whether itâ€™s pizza, beer or doing anything but exercising, we all have our vices, and many of us would like to have better self-control. But what is self-control exactly? A working definition is that itâ€™s the ability to do whatâ€™s in your best interests in the long run â€“ such as managing your weight â€“ over whatâ€™s enjoyable right now â€“ such as gorging on cookies.</p>
<p>In 2007, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister put forward what has become the most influential psychological model of self-control. His <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00534.x">strength model</a> likens willpower to a muscle. If you start doing pushups, youâ€™ll feel only a minor burn. But keep it up, and that minor burn will grow into a full-blown conflagration, at which point you wonâ€™t be able to keep going. Baumeister suggested that the same thing happens when you use self-control. If you overwork your self-control muscle, youâ€™ll eventually run out of willpower, and lose the ability to exert self-control.</p>
<p>The success of Baumeisterâ€™s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307740/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney/">book</a> <em>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength</em> (2012), co-authored with John Tierney, suggests that the strength model resonates with many people. As a doctoral student studying self-control, I can understand why. The model eloquently explains many of our most vexing self-control failures. In the cookie example, the tumultuous week, capped off by an agonising day, sapped your willpower, leaving you unable to resist those cookies. Additionally, it conforms to our commonsense beliefs about self-control. After all, everyone knows that self-control is hard and, more often than not, we need herculean willpower to overcome temptation.</p>
<p>If the strength model is correct, what does this mean for improving your self-control? Applying the muscle analogy, one possibility might be to strengthen your â€˜self-control muscleâ€™. Researchers have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22149456">tested</a> this by asking people to do things such as brush their teeth with their nondominant hand for two weeks. Such exercises are quite challenging because they force you to curtail deeply ingrained habits using â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™. But does self-control training actually work? According to a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691617697076">meta-analysis</a> of many relevant studies, self-control training seems to be effective at improving â€˜self-control staminaâ€™ â€“ the ability to exert inhibitory self-control for longer periods.</p>
<p>So, is that the solution to greater self-discipline? Exercise your self-control muscle and get better at inhibitory self-control?</p>
<p>Your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules</p>
<p>Unfortunately, itâ€™s not so simple. You might have noticed how I switched back and forth between â€˜inhibitory self-controlâ€™ and the broader concept of â€˜self-controlâ€™, but the two are not synonymous. Though boosting your inhibitory self-control or â€˜willpowerâ€™ might sound appealing â€“ perhaps you imagined yourself using inhibitory self-control to force yourself not to eat the cookies, just like you would if you forced yourself to brush with the opposite hand â€“ itâ€™s not clear that inhibitory self-control actually works this way in everyday life.</p>
<p>Take the findings from a 2017 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550616679237">study</a> that involved volunteers recording their daily experiences of temptation for a week. The individuals who experienced more temptation were less likely to achieve their long-term goals, even if they also reported using more inhibitory self-control. This suggests that using inhibitory self-control to resist those cookies might help you in the moment, but not in the long run. So even if you use inhibitory training (eg, the teeth-brushing challenge) to build a brawny self-control muscle, your heroic efforts are likely to leave you looking more like Sisyphus than Hercules.</p>
<p>Research in my own lab and others suggests that, if you want to improve your self-control, what you should do instead is focus on proactively reducing, rather than reactively overpowering temptation. Fortunately, there are several ways and opportunities to do this.</p>
<p>Before getting to the specifics, it helps to think in terms of a model that the American psychologist Angela Duckworth and her colleagues <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691615623247">proposed</a> â€“ â€˜the process model of self-controlâ€™. It organises self-control strategies according to when theyâ€™re initiated in the â€˜temptation generation cycleâ€™. This cycle describes the stages we must go through before we get to the point where we actually act upon a temptation â€“ see the figure below.</p>
<p>For example, to gorge on those cookies at the end of your working week, you first had to go through a <em>situational stage</em>, where you put yourself in a compromising situation with tempting cookies. From there, you transitioned to an <em>attentional stage</em>, where you directed your attention back towards those cookies. After that, you went through an <em>appraisal stage</em>, where you thought about how good those cookies would taste (especially with a glass of milk). All this led to a <em>response stage</em>, where you broke down and eventually ate all the cookies. To put it bluntly, a lot of things had to go wrong for you to end up giving in to temptation. The good news is that this means you could have applied self-control at several instances prior to when you tried and failed to exert <em>inhibitory</em> self-control (or â€˜willpowerâ€™ in everyday talk).</p>
<figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1214/Williamson-self-control-Figure.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption><em>Figure supplied by the author</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Letâ€™s start with the situational stage. You donâ€™t need to be well-versed in social psychology to recognise the power of the situation. Most teachers will tell you itâ€™s easier for students to focus when they sit in the front of the classroom. With this in mind, you could have employed what Duckworthâ€™s team call â€˜situational self-control strategiesâ€™. For instance, instead of sitting in front of a box of cookies and forcing yourself not to eat them, you could have either not bought them in the first place â€“ known as â€˜situation selectionâ€™ â€“ or simply removed them from sight by placing them in a cabinet (or thrown them out) â€“ â€˜situation modificationâ€™.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that these situational strategies are quite effective. For example, one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158155">study</a> that instructed high-school students to use situational strategies (such as removing buzzing cellphones and other temptations from sight) found that they made more progress towards their academic goals, compared with others who were simply instructed to use inhibitory self-control. Similarly, dieting <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666318305889?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint">research</a> suggests that a simple yet overlooked way to lose weight is to avoid situations where tempting, high-calorie foods are readily available. For example, when you go grocery shopping, plan to avoid walking through the bakery. That way, you are less likely to encounter cues (pleasant smells and sights) that strengthen temptation. Think â€˜out of sight, out of mindâ€™.</p>
<p>But what if you canâ€™t use situational strategies? After all, you might have no choice but to walk through the bakery, or perhaps youâ€™ll upset your kids if you throw away the cookies. Thankfully, there are other â€˜psychological strategiesâ€™, initiated during the attentional and appraisal stages, that can be useful when the situation is uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Some clues come from Walter Mischelâ€™s classic â€˜marshmallow testâ€™ that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/152988602317319285">involved</a> children attempting to resist a single beckoning marshmallow for 15 minutes, for the reward of two if they were successful. Among other crucial variables, Mischel and his collaborators, including the American psychologist Ozlem Ayduk, suggested that one reason some kids were so good at resisting temptation was their ability to use â€˜cooling strategiesâ€™. For instance, research in Mischelâ€™s lab found that children would wait longer if they distracted themselves by simply turning away from the marshmallow. He also found that they could wait longer if he taught them to â€˜reappraiseâ€™ the temptation by thinking of the marshmallows as â€˜puffy round cloudsâ€™.</p>
<p>Importantly, these strategies work for adults too. In a series of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219883606">studies</a> I conducted with Ben Wilkowski at the University of Wyoming, we found that the use of distraction (for instance, directing attention away from the temptation to go out by focusing on work thatâ€™s particularly interesting) and reappraisal (reminding oneself there will be many opportunities to go out, but only one opportunity to take the upcoming exam), along with the situational strategies discussed earlier, consistently helped college students make progress towards their long-term goals. So, it might be useful to direct your attention away from the cookies by simply picking up a book or reframing the cookies in a way that makes them seem less desirable. You know, from where Iâ€™m sitting, the cookies look kind of old.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the message from the latest research on willpower is that itâ€™s time to stop lamenting your poor self-control and accept that you have a weak self-control muscle.

<p>I recently had the opportunity to participate in the Fall 1 2020 batch of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, I only attended for one day. Still, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">keeping</a> <a href="https://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2015/07/20/retrospective/">with</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@byshiny/my-recurse-center-batch-winter-2-2019-is-the-best-5e9593386ab">the</a> <a href="http://dev.jdherg.com/posts/2015/07/20/the-recurse-center-a-qa-for-past-me/">spirit</a> <a href="https://ljungblad.nu/post/63534520693/new-york-and-recurse-center-prev-hacker-school">of</a> <a href="https://johnloeber.com/w/hackerschool.html">the</a> <a href="https://blog.jabid.in/2017/08/10/rc.html">times</a>, I thought I would write a retrospective. Time to look back on my RC journey!</p>

<p>I had heard of the Recurse Center some years ago, through (I believe) <a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu’s blog</a>. The basic idea is that RC is a “self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City”. My mental model for what this looked like is something like this: people from various walks of life come together in a common space to do cool/fun software stuff. Longer term or overarching goals vary somewhat from person to person (e.g. some may want a career change, some want to goof off, some want to learn something very specific), but broadly speaking the participants are there to learn, play, and improve as programmers. As a business, RC operates via supplying recruiters with a pool of talented and motivated job candidates. But for the participants itself it is free, and there is no particular pressure to take a job. Sounds pretty awesome!</p>
<p>Looking back at what I was hoping to get out of RC, the main things were</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to get better at software development, and in my experience one of the best ways to do this is through collaboration with others.</li>
<li>I get excited about sharing things I have learned with. I’m rather introverted, but when it comes to topics I am interested in (e.g. math, programming) there is a lot of joy in communication.</li>
<li>I was interested in learning more about alternative institutions for “adult education”. In today’s age, most people have to navigate an uncertain career path, which involves learning new skills, thinking about how to “rebrand” themselves, and so on. I spent some years in academia (including 5 years teaching), so I am fully aware of how that system works and the baggage it carries with it (<strong>cough</strong> lots of time and debt <strong>cough</strong>). Likewise, now that I’ve been in industry for a few years, I have also come to recognize how unseriously “career development” is taken by many employers (though good managers take it upon themselves to look out for their employees in this regard). For these reasons and more, I have felt institutions like the Recurse Center can play an increasingly important role in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I thought the Recurse Center had a lot to offer above and beyond an independent sabbatical. But it’s not easy to make it out there to NYC.</p>

<p>I had flirted with the idea of applying to RC for some time, but personal circumstances made committment to it difficult. The first time I considered attending was in 2016, after finishing a math phd. At the time, I did not have the money to support myself living in NYC without a job for 3 months, and so let go of the idea. The second time I considered attending was last year. I was working in the Bay Area as a software engineer and had enough money to pay the bills, but I was also engaged in a long-distance relationship at that time, and was hesitant to uproot myself in a way that would put more physical and emotional distance between myself and my partner (the good news is we’re married and living together now!).</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Recurse Center has shifted to an online-only format, and suddenly my excuses for not attending had evaporated. I applied for a batch and went through the standard interview process: first a quick Zoom call to talk about big picture stuff (personal motivation and so on), followed by a pair programming session (I worked on a toy computer algebra system in Python). And like that, I had been accepted!</p>
<p>I was quite excited to attend. But the last step was also the scariest: I had to quit my job. There’s a nerve wracking element to quitting a job during a pandemic, but I felt that in my current role I had stopped growing in a positive direction and imagined that attending RC would give me some time and space to move things forward. So I did it – I put in my notice at work, and spend the last two weeks trying my best to leave my (former) teammates in a position for success with me gone.</p>

<p>The RC interview process was relatively simple: there had been two Zoom calls scheduled, and the information about these was displayed on the Recurse website immediately upon login. Once I had been accepted, though, things got a bit messier.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that running an online educational retreat differs substantially from an in-person one. In the week leading up to the first day of my batch I received a dozen or so emails covering various operational details, invitations to join Zulip (the chat / discussion software used), to join the GitHub organization, requests to fill out my Recurse profile, links to documents with titles like “Remote RC Orientation Guide”, and so on. It was a lot to take in, and I was wrapping up my last week at work, but I figured that I would get the hang of things once the batch officially started.</p>
<p>I also was assigned an onboarding buddy, who I chatted with the Saturday before my first day. This was quite fun, as we happened to have a number of overlapping interests, so the conversation naturally took care of itself. This experience reinforced in my mind that I had made the right decision to attend: spending a few weeks / months hacking around on software stuff with people like this seemed like a real treat.</p>
<p>The last thing I remember from onboarding was a link to a shared calendar, to which anyone could create a new event. There were already quite a few on there, such as a weely meeting for people trying to learn more mathematics, another weekly meeting for a ML reading group, a daily leetcode practice time, “office hours” held by various RC staffers, some fun stuff, like a streamed cello practice on saturdays, music / book clubs, and many more.</p>
<p>One of my concerns about attending remotely is the time difference between participants. I’m on Pacific time, the Recurse Center itself is on Eastern time, and many of the participants for the remote batches are even further away: some in South America, some in Europe, and so on. But most seemed to be based out of North America, and it was a relief to see the calendar events: although some were at times which I likely wouldn’t attend (e.g. there was an Elm hacking session at 3am my time), most were mid-morning to early afternoon PST.</p>
<p>Pretty cool! I went to bed Sunday night, looking forward to my first day at RC.</p>

<p>My first day started like many of my recent days: I woke up, fed the cat, made some coffee, and then sat down at my computer. There were a few convesations on Zulip. I RSVP’ed for the ML reading group and mentioned I’d be happy to join them at whatever point they were at (this group had started a few weeks earlier, so they had already read 6 chapters of a book). I chatted with someone re: asyncio in Python. We talked about how you can view `async def` as syntactic sugar over ordinary python coroutine stuff, what the event loop is doing, and so on.</p>
<p>I observed, but did not participate in some slightly touchier conversations. One discussion was about a blog post re: Google, “don’t be evil”, and the actual nature of incentives. As you would expect, people feel rather strongly about this, and two camps emerged (one roughly “capitalism bad; eat the rich”, the other “welcome to realpolitik; smash your illusions”) before it was shut down by RC staff. I confess much of my interest in this particular conversation was just in getting a feel for the norms around such a discussion (i.e. to understand expectations around how I conduct myself or discuss controversial topics, and so on – basically, I just want to talk code and math and otherwise don’t want to piss anyone off). The Recurse Center has a formal code of conduct and set of community guidelines, but at any organization there are also many the unwritten rules. In this case, for example, I am not sure whether the discussion actually violated any explicit guideline, but once a RC staffer asked them to stop it, the participants did so.</p>
<p>And so it goes. Anyways, after this, I started scoping out the first project to work on: I wanted to write a toy version of the <a href="http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/">mill</a> build tool in python to use for another project I had been involved with (basically a big hairy pipeline for astronomical data reduction). I thought through this some, drafted some notes on its design, and ate a late lunch.</p>

<p>There is a common dream which many people experience at some point in their life: they show up to school for the first day of classes, only to realize that they have forgotten to get dressed. I’d never thought about what form this would take for online school. With Zoom, anybody can show up in their underwear, thinking perhaps that the camera is off. But I was dressed!</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, RC used six distinct channels for communicating information to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>direct email, which was the main channel used before I was accepted to the batch</li>
<li>threads on the “Recurse Community” site, which supports something like a message board (but which will also send you emails)</li>
<li>discussions in Zulip (which seemed to be the most active – many conversations every day)</li>
<li>the 1-1 I had with my “onboarding buddy”</li>
<li>the wiki pages, mentioned above</li>
<li>the calendar itself, which is the main way in which events are communicated and coordinated. It’s how I found friends to talk about ML with, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a “Virtual RC” space, which is something like a 2D HTML5 canvas MMO where you can move your avatar to various “rooms”. It’s kind of cute; someone was camped outside by a tree.</p>
<p>Bombarded by all of this information, much of which came last week when I was trying to wrap things up at my job, I basically a) added a tag in gmail to at least get all the RC related notifications under one heading, b) made sure to read the “Remote RC Orientation …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Try it <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/try.html">here</a>! The online version is mainly good for small programs currently; see <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/running.html">running.md</a> for more options.</em></p>
<p><strong>BQN</strong> is a new programming language in the APL lineage, which aims to remove inconsistent and burdensome aspects of the APL tradition and put the great ideas on a firmer footing. BQN is aimed at existing and aspiring APL-family programmers, and using it requires a solid understanding of functions and multidimensional arrays. However, because of its focus on providing simple, consistent, and powerful array operations, BQN should also be a good language for learning array programming and building stronger array intuition.</p>
<p>BQN maintains many of the ideas that made APL\360 revolutionary in 1966:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human-friendly <strong>infix notation</strong> with no precedence rules to remember.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in array operations</strong> handle any number of dimensions easily.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> allow basic functions to be applied in more powerful ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>It incorporates concepts developed over years of APL practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/leading.html"><strong>leading axis model</strong></a>, which allows for simpler built-in functions.</li>
<li>Trains and combinators for <strong>tacit programming</strong>.</li>
<li>Lightweight <strong>anonymous functions</strong> (like <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Dfn">dfns</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But BQN is redesigned from the ground up, with brand new ideas to make these paradigms easier to use and less likely to fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>based array model</strong> makes non-arrays a fundamental part of the language, and removes the surprise of floating arrays and the hassle of explicit boxes. New <strong>array notation</strong> eliminates the gotchas of <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Strand_notation">stranding</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html"><strong>context-free grammar</strong></a> where a value's syntactic role is determined by its spelling makes it easier for machines and humans to understand code.</li>
<li>Oh, and it naturally leads to <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/functional.html"><strong>first-class functions</strong></a>, a feature often missed in APL.</li>
<li>The <strong>new symbols</strong> for built-in functionality allow the syntactic role of a primitive to be distinguished at a glance, and aim to be more consistent and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-name-is-bqn">What kind of name is "BQN"?</h2>
<p>It's three letters, that happen to match the capitals in "Big Questions Notation". You can pronounce it "bacon", but are advised to avoid this unless there's puns.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-bqn-look-like">What does BQN look like?</h2>
<p>Rather strange, most likely:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŠ‘+</span><span>`</span><span>âˆ˜</span><span>âŒ½</span><span>â�Ÿ</span><span>12</span><span>â†•</span><span>2</span>  144
</pre>
<p>For longer samples, you can <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/c.bqn">gaze into the abyss</a> that is the self-hosted compiler, or the <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/src/r.bqn">shallower but wider abyss</a> of the runtime, or take a look at the friendlier <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/md.bqn">markdown processor</a> used to format and highlight documentation files. There are also <a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/examples/fifty.bqn">some translations</a> from <a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/50/">"A History of APL in 50 Functions"</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="array-model">Array model</h2>
<p>Most of BQN's functionality deals with the manipulation of multidimensional arrays. However, it discards many of the complications of traditional APL <a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Array_model">array models</a>. Unlike in APL, non-array data is possible, and common: numbers, characters, and functions are not arrays (see the full list of <a href="#types">types</a> below). This avoids some difficulties that show up when trying to treat scalar arrays as the fundamental unit; in particular, there is no "floating" so a value is always different from a scalar array that contains it. This system has been <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/586656.586663">proposed</a> in APL's past under the name <strong>based array theory</strong>.</p>
<p>Currently, the intention is that arrays will not have prototypes, so that all empty arrays of the same shape behave identically. Different elements of an array should not influence each other. While some APLs force numbers placed in the same array to a common representation, which may have different precision properties, BQN will enforce 64-bit floating-point precision, and only use representations or methods compatible with it (for example, integers up to 32 bits).</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>BQN syntax consists of expressions where computation is done with a little organizing structure around them like assignment, functions, and list notation. Expressions are where the programmer is in control so the design tries to do as much as possible with them before introducing special syntax.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Like APL, BQN uses four <em>syntactic roles</em> for values in expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>, like APL arrays or J nouns</li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong>, or verbs in J</li>
<li><strong>1-Modifiers</strong>, like APL monadic operators or J adverbs</li>
<li><strong>2-Modifiers</strong>, like APL dyadic operators or J conjunctions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These roles work exactly like they do in APL, with functions applying to one or two subject arguments, 1-modifiers taking a single function or subject on the left, and 2-modifiers taking a function or subject on each side.</p>
<p>Unlike APL, in BQN the syntactic role of a value is determined purely by the way it's spelled: a lowercase first letter (<code><span>name</span></code>) makes it a subject, an uppercase first letter (<code><span>Name</span></code>) makes it a function, and underscores are used for 1-modifiers (<code><span>_name</span></code>) and 2-modifiers (<code><span>_name_</span></code>). Below, the function <code><span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span></code> treats its left argument <code><span>ð�•Ž</span></code> as a function and its right argument <code><span>ð�•©</span></code> as a subject. With a list of functions, we can make a table of the square and square root of a few numbers:</p>
<pre>    <span>âŸ¨</span><span>Ã—</span><span>Ëœ</span><span>,</span><span>âˆš</span><span>âŸ©</span> <span>{</span><span>ð�•Ž</span><span>ð�•©</span><span>}</span><span>âŒœ</span> <span>1</span><span>â€¿</span><span>4</span><span>â€¿</span><span>9</span>
â”Œâ”€         
â•µ 1 16 81  
  1  2  3  
          â”˜
</pre>
<p>BQN's built-in operations also have patterns to indicate the syntactic role: 1-modifiers (<code><span>ËœÂ¨Ë˜â�¼âŒœÂ´`</span></code>) are all superscript characters, and 2-modifiers (<code><span>âˆ˜â—‹âŠ¸âŸœâŒ¾âŠ˜â—¶âš‡âŽ‰â�Ÿ</span></code>) all have an unbroken circle (two functions <code><span>âŒ½â�‰</span></code> have broken circles with lines through them). Every other built-in constant is a function, although the special symbols <code><span>Â¯</span></code>, <code><span>âˆž</span></code>, and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> are used as part of numeric literal notation.</p>

<h3 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h3>
<p><em>Combinators</em> only control the application of functions. Because a non-function operand applies as a constant function, some combinators have extra meanings when passed a constant. For example, <code><span>0</span><span>Ëœ</span></code> is the constant function that always returns 0 and <code><span>0</span><span>âŠ¸</span><span>&lt;</span></code> is the function that tests whether its right argument is greater than 0.</p>

<p>Choose isn't really a combinator since it calls the function <code><span>âŠ‘</span></code>, and Under is not a true combinator since it has an "undo" step at the end. This step might be implemented using the left operand's inverse (<em>computational</em> Under) or its structural properties (<em>structural</em> Under).</p>
<p>Other modifiers control array traversal and iteration. In three cases a simpler 1-modifier is paired with a generalized 2-modifier: in each case the 1-modifier happens to be the same as the 2-modifier with a right operand of <code><span>Â¯1</span></code>.</p>

<h2 id="literal-notation">Literal notation</h2>
<h3 id="constant-notation">Constant notation</h3>
<p>BQN has single-token notation for numbers, strings, and characters.</p>
<p>Numbers allow the typical decimal notation with <code><span>Â¯</span></code> for the negative sign (because <code><span>-</span></code> is a function) and <code><span>e</span></code> for scientific notation (or <code><span>E</span></code>, as numeric notation is case-insensitive). <code><span>âˆž</span></code> and <code><span>Ï€</span></code> may be used as special numeric values. Complex numbers are also allowed, with the components separated by <code><span>i</span></code>.</p>
<p>Strings are written with double quotes <code><span>""</span></code>, and characters with single quotes <code>''</code> with a single character in between. A double quote within a string can be escaped by writing it twice; if two string literals are next to each other, they must be separated by a space. In contrast, character literals do not use escapes, as the length is already known.</p>
<h3 id="separators">Separators</h3>
<p>The characters <code><span>â‹„</span></code> and <code><span>,</span></code> and newline are completely interchangeable and are used to separate expressions. An expression might be an element in a list or a line in a function. Empty sectionsâ€”those that consist only of whitespaceâ€”are ignored. This means that any number of separators can be used between expressions, and that leading and trailing separators are also allowed. The expressions are evaluated in text order: left to right and top to bottom.</p>
<h3 id="list-notation">List notation</h3>
<p>Lists (1-dimensional arrays) are enclosed in angle brackets <code><span>âŸ¨âŸ©</span></code>, with the results of the expressions in between being the list's elements. Lists of two elements or more can also be written with the ligature character <code><span>â€¿</span></code>. This character has higher binding strength than any part of an expression. If one of the elements is a compound expression, then it will need to be enclosed in parentheses.</p>

  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>ZzFXM is a tiny JavaScript function that generates stereo music tracks from patterns of note and instrument data.
  Instrument samples are created using a modified<sup>[<a href="#note-code-1">1</a>]</sup> version of the super-tiny <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> sound generator by <a href="https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank Force</a>.
   </p><figure><pre><code>//! ZzFXM (v2.0.1) | (C) Keith Clark | MIT | https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM
zzfxM=(f,n,o,t=125)=&gt;{let z,e,l,r,g,h,x,a,u,c,d,i,m,p,G,M,R=[],b=[],j=[],k=0,q=1,s={},v=zzfxR/t*60&gt;&gt;2;for(;q;k++)R=[q=a=d=m=0],o.map((t,d)=&gt;{for(x=n[t][k]||[0,0,0],q|=!!n[t][k],G=m+(n[t][0].length-2-!a)*v,e=2,r=m;e&lt;x.length+(d==o.length-1);a=++e){for(g=x[e],u=c!=(x[0]||0)|g|0,l=0;l&lt;v&amp;&amp;a;l++&gt;v-99&amp;&amp;u?i+=(i&lt;1)/99:0)h=(1-i)*R[p++]/2||0,b[r]=(b[r]||0)+h*M-h,j[r]=(j[r++]||0)+h*M+h;g&amp;&amp;(i=g%1,M=x[1]||0,(g|=0)&amp;&amp;(R=s[[c=x[p=0]||0,g]]=s[[c,g]]||(z=[...f[c]],z[2]*=2**((g-12)/12),zzfxG(...z))))}m=G});return[b,j]}</code></pre><figcaption>The ZzFXM song generator function — 418 bytes (gzip)</figcaption></figure>   <p>ZzfxM was developed to create music for size-limited productions (i.e. js13k Games). The song format is loosely based on the tracker MOD format, using sequences of repeating patterns to create long songs from small chunks of music data.
  Songs are <em>highly</em> compressible. Once gzipped they're tiny — typically, a few hundred bytes.</p>


  <h2>Playing a song</h2>
  <p>Audio samples are compiled by passing instrument, pattern and sequence data to <code>zzfxM()</code>. The function returns a pair of arrays containing sample data for the left and right stereo channels.
  To play the rendered song, call <code>zzfxP()</code> using the generated sample data. The <code>zzfxM</code> function returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode">AudioBufferSourceNode</a>, which you can use to control the song (stop it, looping etc.).</p>

  <figure><pre><code>const songData = [
  [/* zzfx instruments */],
  [/* patterns */],
  [/* sequence */],
  /* speed (BPM) */
];

const buffer = zzfxM(...songData);    // Generate the sample data
const node = zzfxP(...buffer);        // Play the song
</code></pre><figcaption>Example code</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
    <li id="note-code-1">[1] The modifications allow ZzFX to create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.</li>

<p>Just what exactly <em>is</em> a type?</p>

<p>A common perspective is that types are <em>restrictions</em>. Static types restrict the set of values a variable may contain, capturing some subset of the space of “all possible values.” Under this worldview, a typechecker is sort of like an oracle, predicting which values will end up where when the program runs and making sure they satisfy the constraints the programmer wrote down in the type annotations. Of course, the typechecker can’t <em>really</em> predict the future, so when the typechecker gets it wrong—it can’t “figure out” what a value will be—static types can feel like self-inflicted shackles.</p>

<p>But that is not the <em>only</em> perspective. There is another way—a way that puts you, the programmer, back in the driver’s seat. You make the rules, you call the shots, you set the objectives. You need not be limited any longer by what the designers of your programming language decided the typechecker can and cannot prove. You do not serve the typechecker; the typechecker serves <em>you.</em></p>

<p>…no, I’m not trying to sell you a dubious self-help book for programmers who feel like they’ve lost control of their lives. If the above sounds too good to be true, well… I won’t pretend it’s all actually as easy as I make it sound. Nevertheless, it’s well within the reach of the working programmer, and most remarkably, all it takes is a change in perspective.</p>

<p>Let’s talk a little about TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is a <em>gradually-typed</em> language, which means it’s possible to mix statically- and dynamically-typed code. The original intended use case of gradual typing was to <em>gradually</em> add static types to an existing dynamically-typed codebase, which imposes some interesting design constraints. For one, a valid JavaScript program must also be a valid TypeScript program; for another, TypeScript must be accommodating of traditional JavaScript idioms.</p>

<p>Gradually typed languages like TypeScript are particularly good illustrations of the way type annotations can be viewed as constraints. A function with no explicit type declarations<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup> can accept <em>any</em> JavaScript value, so adding a type annotation fundamentally restricts the set of legal values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, languages like TypeScript tend to have subtyping. This makes it easy to classify certain types as “more restrictive” than others. For example, a type like <code>string | number</code> clearly includes more values than just <code>number</code>, so <code>number</code> is a more restrictive type—a <em>subtype</em>.</p>

<p>An exceptionally concrete way to illustrate this “types are restrictions” mentality is to write a function with an unnecessarily specific type. Here’s a TypeScript function that returns the first element in an array of numbers:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>getFirst</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span>: <span>number</span><span>[])</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>arr</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function would work perfectly well given a list of strings, but if you write <code>getFirst(["hello", "world"])</code>, the typechecker will complain. Of course, in this example the restriction is thoroughly self-imposed—it would be easy to give this function a generic type—but sometimes it’s not quite so easy. For example, suppose we write a function where the return type depends upon the type of the argument:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>function</span> <span>emptyLike</span><span>(</span><span>val</span>: <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>|</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>val</span> <span>===</span> <span>"number"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Now if we write <code>emptyLike(42) * 10</code>, the typechecker will once again complain, claiming the result could be a string—it can’t “figure out” that when we pass a number, we always get a number back.</p>

<p>When type systems are approached from this perspective, the result is often frustration. The programmer knows that the equivalent untyped JavaScript is perfectly well-behaved, so the typechecker comes off as being the highly unfortunate combination of stubborn yet dim-witted. What’s more, the programmer likely has little mental model of the typechecker’s internal operation, so when types like the above are inferred (not explicitly written), it can be unclear what solutions exist to make the error go away.</p>

<p>At this point, the programmer may give up. “Stupid typechecker,” they grumble, changing the return type of <code>emptyLike</code> to <code>any</code>. “If it can’t even figure this out, can it <em>really</em> be all that useful?”</p>

<p>Sadly, this relationship with the typechecker is all too common, and gradually-typed languages in particular tend to create a vicious cycle of frustration:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Gradual type systems are intentionally designed to “just work” on idiomatic code as much as possible, so programmers may not think much about the types except when they get type errors.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Furthermore, many programmers using gradually-typed languages are already adept at programming in the underlying dynamically-typed language, so they have working mental models of program operation in terms of the dynamic semantics alone. They are much less likely to develop a rich mental model of the static semantics of the type system because they are used to reasoning without one.</p></li>

  <p>Gradually typed languages must support idioms from their dynamically-typed heritage, so they often include ad-hoc special cases (such as, for example, special treatment of <code>typeof</code> checks) that obscure the rules the typechecker follows and make them seem semi-magical.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Builtin types are deeply blessed in the type system, strongly encouraging programmers to embrace their full flexibility, but leaving little recourse when they run up against their limits.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>All this frustration breeds a readiness to override the typechecker using casts or <code>any</code>, which ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the typechecker rarely catches any interesting mistakes because it has been so routinely disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>The end result of all of this is a defeatist attitude that views the typechecker as a minor tooling convenience at best (i.e. a fancy autocomplete provider) or an active impediment at worst. Who can really blame them? The type system has (unintentionally of course) been designed in such a way so as to lead them into this dead end. The public perception of type systems settles into that of a strikingly literal nitpicker we endure rather than as a tool we actively leverage.</p>



<p>After everything I said above, it may be hard to imagine seeing types any other way. Indeed, through the lens of TypeScript, the “types are restrictions” mentality is incredibly natural, so much so that it seems self-evident. But let’s move away from TypeScript for a moment and focus on a different language, Haskell, which encourages a somewhat different perspective. If you aren’t familiar with Haskell, that’s alright—I’m going to try to keep the examples in this blog post as accessible as possible whether you’ve written any Haskell or not.</p>

<p>Though Haskell and TypeScript are both statically-typed—and both of their type systems are fairly sophisticated—Haskell’s type system is almost completely different philosophically:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Haskell does not have subtyping,<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-2-return">2</a></sup> which means that every value belongs to exactly one type.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>While JavaScript is built around a small handful of flexible builtin datatypes (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects), Haskell has essentially no blessed, built-in datatypes other than numbers. Key types such as booleans, lists, and tuples are ordinary datatypes defined in the standard library, no different from types users could define.<sup><a href="#2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-definition" name="2020-08-13-types-as-axioms-or-playing-god-with-static-types-footnote-3-return">3</a></sup></p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In particular, Haskell is built around the idea that datatypes can be defined with multiple <em>cases</em>, and branching is done via pattern-matching (more on this shortly).</p></li></ul>

<p>Let’s look at a basic Haskell datatype declaration. Suppose we want to define a type that represents a season:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>data</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>Spring</span> <span>|</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>|</span> <span>Fall</span> <span>|</span> <span>Winter</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are familiar with TypeScript, this may look rather similar to a union type; if you’re familiar with a C-family language, this may remind you more of an enum. Both are on the right track: this defines a new type named <code>Season</code> with four possible values, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>are</em> those values?</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>In TypeScript, we’d represent this type with a union of strings, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>type</span> <span>Season</span> <span>=</span> <span>"spring"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"summer"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"fall"</span> <span>|</span> <span>"winter"</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>Season</code> is a type that can be one of those four strings, but nothing else.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>In C, we’d represent this type with an enum, like this:</p>
  <div>
   <div>
    <pre><span></span><span>enum</span> <span>season</span> <span>{</span> <span>SPRING</span><span>,</span> <span>SUMMER</span><span>,</span> <span>FALL</span><span>,</span> <span>WINTER</span> <span>};</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
  <p>Here, <code>SPRING</code>, <code>SUMMER</code>, <code>FALL</code>, and <code>WINTER</code> are essentially defined to be global aliases for the integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, and the type <code>enum season</code> is essentially an alias for <code>int</code>.</p></li></ul>

<p>So in TypeScript, the values are strings, and in C, the values are numbers. What are they in Haskell? Well… they simply <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>The Haskell declaration invents four completely new constants out of thin air, <code>Spring</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Fall</code>, and <code>Winter</code>. They aren’t aliases for numbers, nor are they symbols or strings. The compiler doesn’t expose anything about how it chooses to represent these values at runtime; that’s an implementation detail. In Haskell, <code>Spring</code> is now a value <em>distinct from all other values</em>, even if someone in a different module were to also use the name <code>Spring</code>. Haskell type declarations let us play god, creating something from nothing.</p>

<p>Since these values are totally unique, abstract constants, what can we actually do with them? The answer is one thing and <em>exactly</em> one thing: we can branch on them. For example, we can write a function that takes a <code>Season</code> as an argument and returns whether or not Christmas occurs during it:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>containsChristmas</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>containsChristmas</span> <span>season</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span>
  <span>Spring</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Summer</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- southern hemisphere</span>
  <span>Fall</span>   <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>
  <span>Winter</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>  <span>-- northern hemisphere</span>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><code>case</code> expressions are, to a first approximation, a lot like C-style <code>switch</code> statements (though they can do a lot more than this simple example suggests). Using <code>case</code>, we can also define conversions from our totally unique <code>Season</code> constants to other types, if we want:</p>

<div>
 <div>
  <pre><span></span><span>seasonToString</span> <span>::</span> <span>Season</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>S…</span></pre></div></div></article></div></section></div>

installed, check that you have <code>GOPATH</code> set correctly, and it will end
up in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code>. And make sure that its in your path by checking

<h2 id="using-an-old-blackberry-as-a-portable-ssh-or-telnet-terminal">Using an old BlackBerry as a portable SSH (or Telnet) terminal</h2>
<p>You used to see BlackBerries everywhere. Sites such as CrackBerry detailed sightings of celebrities using them constantly. Nowadays, not so much. However, I believe they still have some usecases today. One of these is as a portable terminal. Here's why one might want to use one of these devices as a terminal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice built-in physical keyboard</li>
<li>Long standby battery life
<ul>
<li>Easily swappable batteries (see my Altoids tin filled with batteries below!)</li>
<li>The 7290 I'm using reportedly has a 216 hour standby battery life, and unlike modern phones this number seems to hold up relatively well even with network enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affordable
<ul>
<li>You can easily find these devices for ~$20 on eBay</li>
<li>You can get a 100 MB data plan from US Mobile for $2/mo. not including fees (closer to $5/mo. with fees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extremely portable
<ul>
<li>Much smaller than other devices one might use for this kind of thing
<ul>
<li>OpenPandora</li>
<li>GPD Pocket</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much shorter than most modern phones</li>
<li>Cellular connection means you don't need a wireless router around</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decently rugged
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as prone to failure after drops as modern smartphones (in my experience)
<ul>
<li>The screen is recessed, so it doesn't take the brunt of falls</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Easy to setup
<ul>
<li>You can simply browse to <a href="http://xk72.com/wap">http://xk72.com/wap</a> on the phone itself to install an SSH client (MidpSSH) over the air</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I've been using a BlackBerry 7290 on the US Mobile network, which still supports GSM for now. It's notable that the SSH negotiation is decently slow (~30-45 seconds), but is decently usable after connected (things are still a little sluggish however). Furthermore, I had to reenable the weak DSA public key algorithm as well. This doesn't bother me so much as I basically have a middleman server that allows this weak standard that I talk to everything else through rather than enabling it on every server.</p>
<p>To make things easier on myself, I wrote an <a href="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/postlogin.txt">interactive script</a> that is sourced by <code>.bashrc</code> upon logging in that asks what I actually want to connect to and then does so for me.</p>
<p>In the future, I might move to a BlackBerry 8700(c/g) as they support EDGE (much faster network speed), have much faster CPUs, and a higher standby time. I am not sure what I am going to do in the long run, as 2G networks in the US will probably all be shut down by the end of the year with 3G soon to follow. I guess I can just enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Here are the lines I added to my <code>sshd</code> config for the BlackBerry to be able to connect:</p>
<pre><code>HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Ciphers +3des-cbc
</code></pre>
<p>And here are some pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/connected.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Connected and at the interactive prompt</em></p>
<p><img src="https://rqsall.com/posts/files/top.jpg"></p>
<p><em><code>top</code> output from one server</em></p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Some thoughts on Mozilla for people who don’t know Mozilla.</em></p>

<p>By now everyone in the tech world has heard of the major layoffs at
the Mozilla Corporation, the organization that creates and distributes
the Firefox web browser. (For those who haven’t heard, about 250
people were laid off, about a quarter of the work force.) Lots of
people in the tech world have spoken their piece about the
significance of this event and what it means for the future of
Mozilla, the web, and so on.</p>

<p>Rather than write something of and for the tech world, I wanted to
briefly explain what’s going on for those of my readers who don’t know
HTML from XML, and who are more familar with the worlds of nonprofits
and regular old businesses. I used to work for Mozilla, and have more
knowledge of it and (I hope) insight into it than most people, but
I’ve been gone from Mozilla for ten years now. Thus what I write below
is based on observing it from a distance, like seeing an old friend
whose life has long since diverged from mine.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I work for a tech company, and I don’t usually write about
other tech companies. So I will strongly emphasize that what I write
here are my personal opinions only, and do not represent the positions
of my present employer or past employers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-mozilla">What is Mozilla?</h2>

<p>Mozilla is actually two things, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation, which are often confused and conflated in public
discourse. (There’s actually at least one other piece, but these two
are the main ones.) The Mozilla Foundation, founded in 2003 to take
over development of the source code for the Netscape web browser, is a
501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization, with a staff of 80 people
and a budget of about $27 million in 2018, the last year for which
figures are available. The Mozilla Corporation, founded in 2005, is a
for-profit business, wholly owned by the Mozilla Foundation, with a
staff of about a thousand and revenue of about $440 million, again
from the 2018 financials.</p>

<p>This organizational structure was designed to allow the Mozilla
Corporation to engage in business activities which would be
incompatible with 501(c)(3) status, with a portion of the revenues
from those activities directed to the Mozilla Foundation to help fund
its activities. Having a nonprofit parent also means that the
management and employees of the Mozilla Corporation can help serve the
public benefit goals of the Mozilla Foundation, while still having
interesting jobs, being paid reasonably well, and feeling themselves
to be part of the overall Silicon Valley high-tech milieu.</p>

<p>Second: The customers of the Mozilla Corporation are not the users of
Firefox (among whom you may count yourself). The Mozilla Corporation’s
customers are large corporations like Google that pay for things that
will help them make money, most notably having their Internet search
service be the default in the Firefox browser. And to complete the old
saying, “If you’re not the customer…”, then the 200+ million Firefox
users are the product, potential viewers of ads served up by Google or
others.</p>

<p>(The existence of the Firefox browser as a competitor to Google’s
Chrome browser also supposedly helps Google avoid unwelcome antitrust
attention, especially now that Microsoft has abandoned its own browser
development efforts to base its own browser on the Chrome code. But
it’s unclear how important this consideration actually is to Google
senior management.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the Mozilla Corporation these search engine
relationships proved extremely lucrative, jumping from less than $5
million in 2004 to over $50 million in 2005, the first year in which
the Mozilla Corporation reported financial results, and eventually
growing to a high of about $540 million in 2017.</p>

<p>But as the number of Firefox users decreases (due to the growing
market dominance of the Chrome browser), and those users click on
fewer online ads (for example, because they’re spending less during
the COVID-19 pandemic), the willingness of Google and other customers
to pay the Mozilla Corporation for those users decreases
accordingly. Thus the Mozilla Corporation cutting a quarter of its
workforce.</p>

<p>(In contrast, to my knowledge the Mozilla Foundation itself is not
laying off anyone, at least at this time. It gets its funding from a
combination of royalties from the Mozilla Corporation for use of the
Firefox and Mozilla trademarks, government and foundation grants, and
individual donations. For 2018 the royalties accounted for about half
of the Mozilla Foundation’s budget, with grants and individual donations
each accounting for about a quarter of the budget.)</p>

<p>So, if you’re an avid user of the Firefox browser and want to chip in
a few dollars to help support its development, there’s actually no way
for you to do so, at least not at present. Your donations will go to
the Mozilla Foundation, which will use them to help fund its outreach
and advocacy initiatives, of which it has several. The Mozilla
Foundation itself does not develop Firefox—or any other software, to
my knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="whence-mozilla">Whence Mozilla?</h2>

<p>How has Mozilla (or, more correctly, the Mozilla Corporation) come
to its present pass? The best way I can explain it is that the Mozilla
Corporation is not really a business in the way we’d normally think of
a business, profit-focused and subject to market discipline.</p>

<p>Instead you can think of the Mozilla Corporation as being analogous to
the Bell Labs or Xerox PARC of yore, R&amp;D organizations funded by a
seemingly-unending stream of profits earned by other businesses that
enjoyed dominant positions in their respective markets. In this sense
Google is to Mozilla as AT&amp;T was to Bell Labs, or Xerox to Xerox
PARC.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation provided a home
for some of the smartest software developers around. Like those
organizations, the Mozila Corporation has initiated a myriad of
projects ranging from the mundane and useful (like the Firefox
browser) to the esoteric and speculative. Like those organizations,
the Mozilla Corporation has given away much of what it has produced in
the form of public goods available to everyone at no charge.</p>

<p>Like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, the Mozilla Corporation has indulged a
taste for “build it yourself” vertical integration, and in particular
for creating its own bespoke development tools and software stack. For
example, like those organizations the Mozilla Corporation has created
its own operating system (FirefoxOS), its own programming language
(Rust), and (of course) its own graphical user environment in the form
of the Firefox browser (not to mention yet another web browser, this
one more research-oriented, and various experiments in software for
virtual reality environments).</p>

<p>And finally, the Mozilla Corporation is engaged in the same struggle
that Bell Labs and Xerox PARC found themselves in: trying to convert a
research-oriented organization into an actual business, and capture
for itself more of the value that it has been providing to the world
(and to its past, present, and future competitors) for free.</p>

<h2 id="whither-mozilla">Whither Mozilla?</h2>

<p>What will happen to Mozilla, and to the Mozilla Corporation in
particular? The basic situation is that Mozilla has tried to be at
least three things simultaneously: an advocacy organization, a
developer and distributor of mass market consumer software and related
services, and (as noted above) a research lab.</p>

<p>Being an advocacy organization is relatively inexpensive, but the
other two functions are not: software development (including
research-related activities) and branding and marketing together
consumed almost three quarters of the combined Mozilla Corporation and
Foundation expense budget of $450 million in 2018. Thus when COVID-19
hit and the Mozilla Corporation hit a brick wall in terms of search
engine revenue, its choice was apparently either to stop being a
consumer software and services company, or to stop being a research
lab.</p>

<p>In the end Mozilla Corporation senior management apparently decided to
go for being a consumer software and services company, and to ditch
any activities not related to that, including research projects.
Having done so, the Mozilla Corporation faces a number of problems:</p>

<p>First, as noted above the Mozilla ethos is arguably more like that of
an R&amp;D lab than of a business proper. Just getting Mozilla
employees to think of themselves as working in the service of a
profit-driven business, and to act in accordance with that thought
every single day, may be an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Second, Mozilla is arguably becoming superfluous, at least as far as
its own largest customer, Google, is concerned. Google has its own
browser and browser development team, its own research lab, and
presumably an inclination to want to spend its R&amp;D money on things
it can control and direct itself. Google also has the ability and the
opportunity to capture the remaining base of Firefox users, at least
those that are monetizable.</p>

<p>There will always be a core of enthusiastic Firefox users, but a lot
of them switch their search engine to something other than Google, run
ad blockers, and don’t click on online ads. Thus they are for the most
part irrelevant from Google’s point of view. At some point the major
value Firefox has for Google will be as presumed insulation from
antitrust enforcement efforts targeting Chrome, but such insurance,
even if it’s of value to Google, doesn’t necessarily require a large
Firefox user base.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s …</p></section></div>

<section>

<a name="1:1"></a>
<a name="1:2"></a><div><a name="1:2"><h4>2. Introduction</h4></a>
<p>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's <a href="https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048">2048</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/justinmeiners/lc3-rogue">Roguelike</a>. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.
</p>
<p>The final code is about 250 lines of C (<a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3.c">unix</a>, <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/src/lc3-win.c">windows</a>).
All you need to know is how to read basic C or C++ and how to do <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/BinaryMath/BinaryMath.html">binary arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> This VM is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate program</a>. This means you are reading the source code right now! Each piece of code from the project will be shown and explained thoroughly, so you can be sure nothing is left out. The final code was created by <a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate">"weaving"</a> the blocks of code together.
</p>

<h3> What is a virtual machine?</h3>
<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.
</p>
<p>The amount of computer hardware the VM attempts to simulate depends on its purpose. Some VMs are designed to reproduce the behavior of some particular computer, such as video game emulators. Most people don't have an NES lying around anymore, but we can still play NES games by simulating the NES hardware in a program. These emulators must <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Tricky-to-emulate_games">faithfully recreate</a> every <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests">detail</a> and major hardware component of the original device.
</p>
<p>Other VMs don't act like any real computer and are entirely made up! This is primarily done to make software development easier. Imagine you wanted to create a program that ran on multiple computer architectures. A VM could offer a standard platform which provided portability for all of them. Instead of rewriting a program in different dialects of assembly for each CPU architecture, you would only need to write the small VM program in each assembly language. Each program would then be written only once in the VM's assembly language.
</p>

</p>
<p><img src="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/img/vm.gif" alt="vm for each architecture">
</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> A compiler solves a similar problem by compiling a standard <em>high-level language</em> to several CPU architectures. A VM creates one standard <em>CPU architecture</em> which is simulated on various hardware devices. One advantage of a compiler is that it has no runtime overhead while a VM does. Even though compilers do a pretty good job, writing a new one that targets multiple platforms is very difficult, so VMs are still helpful here. In practice, VMs and compilers are mixed at various levels.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</a> is a very successful example. The JVM itself is a moderately sized program that is small enough for one programmer to understand. This has made it possible to be written for thousands of devices including phones. Once the JVM is implemented on a new device, any Java, Kotlin, or Clojure program ever written can run on it without modification. The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">further abstraction</a> from the machine. Most of the time, this is a pretty good tradeoff.
</p>
<p>A VM doesn't have to be large or pervasive to provide a similar benefit. Old <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/anotherWorld_code_review/">video games</a> often used small VMs to provide simple <a href="https://sf2platinum.wordpress.com/page/1/">scripting systems</a>.
</p>
<p>VMs are also useful for executing code in a secure or isolated way. One application of this is garbage collection. There <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/24.2.html">is no trivial way</a> to implement automatic garbage collection on top of C or C++ since a program cannot see its own stack or variables. However, a VM is “outside” the program it is running and can observe all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection">memory references</a> on the stack.
</p>
<p>Another example of this behavior is demonstrated by <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html">Ethereum smart contracts</a>. Smart contracts are small programs which are executed by each validating node in the blockchain network. This requires the node operators to run programs on their machines that have been written by complete strangers, without any opportunity to scrutinize them beforehand. To prevent a contract from doing malicious things, they are run inside a <a href="http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html#ethereum-virtual-machine">VM</a> that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc. Ethereum is also a good application of the portability features that result when using a VM. Since Ethereum nodes can be run on many kinds of computers and operating systems, the use of a VM allows smart contracts to be written without any consideration of the many platforms they run on.

<p>Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3">LC-3</a>. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html">compared to x86</a>, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.
</p>
<p>First, we need to simulate the essential hardware components of the machine. Try to understand what each component is, but don't worry right now if you are unsure of how it fits into the larger picture. Start by creating a C file. Each of the code snippets in this section should be placed in the global scope of this file.
</p>
<h3> Memory</h3>
<p>The LC-3 has 65,536 memory locations (the maximum that is addressable by a 16-bit unsigned integer <code>2^16</code>), each of which stores a 16-bit value. This means it can store a total of only 128kb, which is a lot smaller than you may be used to! In our program, this memory will be stored in a simple array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Memory Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>/* 65536 locations */
uint16_t memory[UINT16_MAX];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Registers</h3>
<p>A register is a slot for storing a single value on the CPU. Registers are like the "workbench" of the CPU. For the CPU to work with a piece of data, it has to be in one of the registers. However, since there are just a few registers, only a minimal amount of data can be loaded at any given time. Programs work around this by loading values from memory into registers, calculating values into other registers, and then storing the final results back in memory.
</p>
<p>The LC-3 has 10 total registers, each of which is 16 bits. Most of them are general purpose, but a few have designated roles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>8 general purpose registers  (<code>R0</code>-<code>R7</code>)
</li>
<li>1 program counter (<code>PC</code>) register
</li>
<li>1 condition flags (<code>COND</code>) register
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general purpose registers can be used to perform any program calculations. The program counter is an unsigned integer which is the address of the next instruction in memory to execute. The condition flags tell us information about the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Registers <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    R_R0 = 0,
    R_R1,
    R_R2,
    R_R3,
    R_R4,
    R_R5,
    R_R6,
    R_R7,
    R_PC, /* program counter */
    R_COND,
    R_COUNT
};
</pre>



</div>
<p>Just like the memory, we will store the registers in an array:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Register Storage <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>uint16_t reg[R_COUNT];
</pre>


<p>Used in section <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:11">11</a></p>
</div>
<h3> Instruction Set</h3>
<p>An instruction is a command which tells the CPU to do some fundamental task, such as add two numbers. Instructions have both an <strong>opcode</strong> which indicates the kind of task to perform and a set of <strong>parameters</strong> which provide inputs to the task being performed.
</p>
<p>Each <strong>opcode</strong> represents one task that the CPU "knows" how to do. There are just 16 opcodes in LC-3. Everything the computer can calculate is some sequence of these simple instructions. Each instruction is 16 bits long, with the left 4 bits storing the opcode. The rest of the bits are used to store the parameters.
</p>
<p>We will discuss, in detail, what each instruction does later. For now, define the following opcodes. Make sure they stay in this order so that they are assigned the proper enum value:
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Opcodes <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};
</pre>



</div>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Note:</strong> The Intel x86 architecture has hundreds of instructions, while others such as ARM and LC-3 have very few. Small instruction sets are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISCs</a> while larger ones are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISCs</a>. Larger instruction sets typically do not provide any fundamentally new possibilities, but they <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/risccisc/">often make it more convenient</a> to write assembly for. A single instruction in CISC might take the place of several in RISC. However, they tend to be more complex and expensive for engineers to design and manufacture. This and other tradeoffs cause the designs to come <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/269/why-would-anyone-want-cisc">in and out of style</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Condition Flags</h3>
<p>The <code>R_COND</code> register stores condition flags which provide information about the most recently executed calculation. This allows programs to check logical conditions such as <code>if (x &gt; 0) { ... }</code>.
</p>
<p>Each CPU has a variety of condition flags to signal various situations. The LC-3 uses only 3 condition flags which indicate the sign of the previous calculation.
</p>

<div>
<p><span>{Condition Flags <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/index.html#1:3">3</a>}</span></p><pre>enum

    FL_POS = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, /* P */
    FL_ZRO = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, /* Z */
    FL_NEG = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, /* N */
};

	<p>Write code that’s compatible with how your brain works.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Video</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE">Philip reading this essay</a>.</p>
<p>The 1956 paper <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/">The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus
Two</a></em> is the most widely cited paper
in the 126 year history of the journal <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Review">Psychological
Review</a></em>. The author
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armitage_Miller">George A. Miller</a> is
considered one of the founders in the field of cognitive science. His
historic claim is that you can only juggle <strong>between 5 and 9 things</strong> in
your brain at any one time.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, despite some
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4486516/">controversy</a> over
the years, this 7 ± 2 figure has withstood the ongoing
<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">reproducibility
crisis</a>
and it appears to capture a deep truth about how our brains actually
function.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical of the claim because seven sounds like an
absurdly small number, surely if you are doing something complex like
writing software, or planning a wedding for that matter, you are juggling
dozens to hundreds of things? As it turns out you are not. At least not at
once.</p>

The first 225 digits of <a href="https://dancohen.org/2010/03/08/the-last-digit-of-pi/">Pi</a>.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>In 2005 <strong>Lu Chao</strong> recited <a href="https://www.livescience.com/50134-pi-day-memory-experts.html">67,890
digits</a> of
Pi, a mind-boggling demonstration of a gifted and well-trained mind. Yet
given a series of random single-digit numbers he can on average recall less
the than nine of them, to be exact he’s been measured to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span#Digit-span">digit
span</a> of 8.83 which
fits perfectly within Miller’s finding. Amazing!</p>
<p>Chao memorizes Pi the same way story tellers once memorized long tales
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, yet he can only
juggle a handful of things at one time. I find this actually to be very
comforting, he is not a freak of nature, at least not as freaky as you
first thought.</p>
<p>The illusion we can hold many things in mind is almost identical to the
illusion that our field of view is high resolution everywhere. It’s
incredibly compelling because the instant we wonder <em>what’s over there</em> we
do a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a> and are
immediately rewarded with a high resolution view of exactly <em>what’s over
there</em>. We ask the question and we get an instant answer, so it feels like
the answer was there the whole time.</p>

fovea is, it's actually only about as big as quarter held at arm's length.

<p>Thinking in general works very much like vision. This is not surprising
since it’s implemented using the same brain hardware. As we rapidly flit
from idea to idea, from concept to concept, we page in the necessary
details, but at no time do we have more than about nine individual things
in the front of our minds.</p>
<p>How do we navigate a complex world with this seemingly crippling limit on
the size of our working memory? Two of the primary tools that we use are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)">chunking</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>When we think of a car we naturally divide the car into a handful of high
level chunks like the <em>engine</em>, the <em>dashboard</em>, the <em>seats</em>, the <em>wheels</em>.
When we mentally zoom into the engine, however, it effortlessly resolves
into more parts: the <em>engine block</em>, the <em>pistons</em>, the <em>spark plugs</em>. And
we can keep zooming in, although how far we can zoom in highly depends on
how much we know about cars and the world in general.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object Oriented
Programming</a> one
of the simplest ways to tame complexity is to limit your objects to around
seven <em>attributes</em>. In some languages attributes are called <em>member
variables</em> or <em>fields</em>. Many programmers immediately balk at this
suggestion. Sure, that works for toy examples, but I’m writing serious
software and my objects sometimes need 10, 20 or 50 attributes. You must be
working on easy stuff, they will say. My problems are special, so my code
has to be different.</p>
<p>The biggest trap of software development is that it’s easy, trivial in
fact, to write software that you yourself cannot understand, and in turn no
one else can understand. Even a novice, <em>especially</em> a novice, can in a few
weeks write software that literally no one on the planet can easily think
or reason about. That’s depressing, but also kind of impressive in a way.
With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>Objects which have too many attributes are a major cause of software that’s
too complicated to understand. Some people conclude the problem is Object
Oriented Programming itself. This is not a crazy idea, there are <a href="https://tobeva.com/resources/technical/programming/functional/">other
ways</a> to program, and they do
have advantages, but in my experience most of the flaws attributed to
Object Oriented Programming stem from having done it poorly, and boy is it
easy to do poorly.</p>







<div>
	<p><img src="https://tobeva.com/articles/brain-oriented-programming/complex_hua73d922edef0eeb6c3d75f190e4c0729_39455_350x0_resize_q75_catmullrom.jpg" width="350" height="197"></p><p>
Complexity grows without bound.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>The key thing to realize is a single object with a lot of attributes is
itself <em>not</em> Object Oriented. Instead, it’s a 1970s style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured
Program</a> in disguise.
The attributes of the object are the <strong>global variables</strong> of the program,
and the object’s methods are the program’s <strong>functions</strong>. Every function
can freely access every global variable which is what causes many of the
problems.</p>
<p>A structured program with more than seven global variables is trouble, and
if many objects in your program are effectively messy structured programs
themselves, you are in serious trouble indeed. At a high level you are
doing Object Oriented Programming, but at a low level you are right back in
the 1970s struggling to deal with one confusing program after the next.</p>
<p>How do we save this sinking ship? We save it by actively and aggressively
keeping the number of attributes per object <strong>at or below seven</strong>. If you
fail to do this you are punting the problem <em>to your future self</em>, a
problem that by definition your future self is going to have a hard time
solving.</p>
<p>Just today I had a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> class called
<code>PerfEvent</code> with these attributes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>start_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>start_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>end_ns</span> <span>=</span> <span>end_ns</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>process_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>process_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>thread_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread_id</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s eight attributes, since eight is only one over the limit, should we
wait until the object grows bigger? No, let’s deal with it <em>now</em>. To reduce
the number of attributes we introduce two new classes or structs: <code>Span</code>
and <code>Origin</code>. Each only has two attributes, but now the original object has
been slimmed down to six attributes, all is well again:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Span</span><span>(</span><span>start_ns</span><span>,</span> <span>end_ns</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>category</span> <span>=</span> <span>category</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>Origin</span><span>(</span><span>process_id</span><span>,</span> <span>thread_id</span><span>)</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>kwargs</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>phase</span> <span>=</span> <span>phase</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although it’s a minor change, compare the two versions, the improved one
simply <em>looks</em> better, even if you stand far back and squint.</p>
<p>It seems minor, but if you don’t make these types of changes as you go it
will eventually lead to <em>intractable</em> complexity, the type of complexity
that causes projects and companies to fail, the type of complexity that
seduces humans into wasting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">billions of
dollars</a>
every year writing software that does not work.</p>
<p>The benefits of introducing sub-objects goes far beyond just reducing the
number of attributes. While accessing the attributes is slightly more
verbose, I like the sound of <code>self.span.start_ns</code> compared to just
<code>self.start_ns</code>, but more importantly we can now pass <code>Span</code>'s and
<code>Owner</code>'s to functions, slimming down and chunking <em>their</em> argument lists.</p>
<p>We’ve introduced two natural and useful concepts that will pay ongoing
dividends, but even better don’t just think of how your code is today,
think about how it’s going to grow over time. Your single monolithic object
has sprouted two buds. You can now push functionality down into these buds,
and they can grow into branches, which later can sprout buds of their own.</p>
<p>For example we can now give <code>Span</code> a <code>get_duration_ns()</code> method. Again it seems
minor, but writing <code>span.get_duration_ns()</code> is better than writing
<code>span.end_ns - span.start_ns</code> especially if you are going to do that in
many different places.</p>
<p>The real magic though is that the benefits of being disciplined will accrue
like <a href="https://youtu.be/GtaoP0skPWc">compound interest</a> as you convert your
monolithic object into an intricately structured tree which buds and
sprouts and branches organically. You will benefit from this better design
every minute you are working on the software, and the software will benefit
greatly from your improved mood and ability to sustain focus.</p>

A carefully tended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai">Bonsai</a> tree.
</p>
	
</div>
<p>Code, like most human created artifacts, can be beautiful, so there is an
aesthetic pay off here, but the real jackpot is that if you assiduously
tend and groom this tree you will create a software design that slides into
your head with minimal fuss and friction, and slides similarly into the
heads of other people.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that we find natural environments to be more soothing than
the made world, than the concrete jungle. The design of the natural world
tends to be more in harmony with how our brains think about that world.
Game recognizes game.</p>
<p>Over time, you will grow a system that you and others can <strong>understand</strong>,
<strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>extend</strong>. When people look at your code years
from now, maybe even in the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">far
future</a>, they will benefit from your
diligence and hard work. And the punchline is doing all this is not hard.
In fact, it’s <em>much easier</em> to do this work than not to not do it.</p>
<p>It’s easier and more pleasant to work with something that’s well crafted
and simpatico with your thinking. It’s hard and unpleasant to constantly
wrestle with something you don’t understand. Trim, prune and shape your
objects early and often. Your brain will thank you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Over the years, I've worked on building search traffic for two kinds of sites.</p> <p>The first, was working for companies that already had hundreds of thousands or millions of monthly users and were trying to build their traffic via a team of writers. I did this first for Verbling (as a side component to my work as a full-time dev), and then later for Codementor, as a remote growth consultant.</p> <p>The second, was my own sites or apps where 100% of the content was produced by me. I've also helped several other independent solo-founders do essentially the same for their own projects. Today's advice is for 2nd type of site—the ones with just one writer.</p> <p>For a quick point of reference, I'll what I'm currently working on so you can get an idea of how applicable my experience is or isn't to you:  <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a>. It targets an extremely small programming niche and is hovering around Alexa 700k (10-15k uniques/month with decent visit time). I add new content about once a week. Previously, I built a considerably larger personal blog that peaked at about Alexa 300k, but it's no longer up.</p> <h2 id="work-with-the-search-engine"><a href="#work-with-the-search-engine">#</a> Work <em>with</em> the search engine</h2> <p>There's a lot of competition for attention from search engines and an entire industry of people trying to game them. It's possible to do that successfully in the short term, but people who do that generally get crushed when new search ranking updates. The more egregious marketers sometimes get penalized or banned entirely.</p> <p>There are certain technical SEO basics to pay attention to, such as having a reasonable site structure, a sitemap and appropriate meta-tags. I'm going to assume you've got that covered. WordPress or any other modern CMS will do an adequate job out of the box.</p> <p>So with the above assumptions, what's a good way to cut through the competition?</p> <h2 id="pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating"><a href="#pay-attention-when-a-search-is-frustrating">#</a> Pay attention when a search is frustrating</h2> <p>The single most successful strategy I've found for getting search engine traffic for a more niche site has been to pay very close attention when something is difficult to find online. This isn't very difficult to do, since it's easy to notice when something is frustrating. The key is to be aware and take notes.</p> <p>Look at your browser history and write down <em>the exact queries</em> you typed into Google, Duckduckgo or your search engine of choice. Ask yourself <em>what</em> you were hoping to find online and why you tried each query after the first.</p> <h2 id="create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find"><a href="#create-what-you-hoped-your-search-would-find">#</a> Create what you hoped your search would find</h2> <p>Then, after you've learned what you were trying to learn during your frustrating search, create the very thing you were trying to find.</p> <p>Usually a search is difficult because the ideal answer doesn't exist in a single document online or video. Instead, finding the answer involves piecing the information together from numerous sources. If that was the case with your frustrating search, then the next step is to create the answer to the search and publish it.</p> <p>Occasionally after a long and frustrating search, you <em>will</em> find a single resource that answers exactly what you wanted. In this case the question is, "Why didn't my first several searches return this document?" Maybe it used different terminology than you did. Maybe it was comment on an ancient forum post. Maybe it was on an extremely slow site. Make your own version of the resource you finally found, but fix whatever issue made it difficult to find.</p> <h3 id="an-example"><a href="#an-example">#</a> An example</h3> <p>One direct example of using this strategy was when it took me about 20 minutes of searching to find out how to do a certain kind of query with Elixir's main DB-related library, Ecto. Elixir maps are stored in Postgres as JSONB fields, and I wanted to query fields within the JSONB.</p> <p>I saw I'd made 8 searches, starting with <em>"query nested fields of a map ecto"</em>. Ultimately the whole answer to what I was looking for was split between a Thoughtbot post, a Stack Overflow answer and a Postgres documentation page.</p> <p>Then I wrote a short article called, <a href="https://alchemist.camp/articles/querying-nested-map-ecto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Querying nested fields of a map with Ecto</a> that contained exactly the information I'd been looking for, and it's since brought in a thousand visitors from search in under a year.</p> <h2 id="why-does-this-work"><a href="#why-does-this-work">#</a> Why does this work?</h2> <p>This strategy tends to be stable because it works with the search engine and doesn't tend to get crushed by updates the way more aggressive techniques do. It leads to creating genuinely helpful resources for people to find online and Google has every incentive to return them in its results.</p> <p>Content created this way tends to rank well because the entire strategy revolves around escaping competition. If there is a lot of competition around a query, it's generally well-answered and you'll find an adequate (though possibly spammy, advertising-stuffed) result within a search or two. The searches that are <em>really</em> frustrating are usually not going to have much competition.</p> <p>Unless your interests are <strong>truly</strong> rare, others will search for what you did and find your page.</p>  <br></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Why</h2>
<p>One encoding covering <em>most</em> of the world’s writing systems. Standard
encoding of the web, most operating systems, Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Before Unicode, each script (or script family) had its own encoding, or
worse, lots of different incompatible encodings. Unicode is a superset
of almost all of them, so can be used for interchange.</p>
<p>It’s been around for <a href="http://www.unicode.org/history/unicode88.pdf">over 30 years</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: code examples are Perl-centric so far, because it has really good Unicode
support and I know it; if you have examples for other languages, please do post
a comment!</em></p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p><img alt="Unicode character examples" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/unichar-examples.png"></p>
<p>Unicode defines a <em>code point</em> (number) for every character, such as <span><span data-code="0061" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A (U+0061)">a</span></span>, <span><span data-code="00E3" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE (U+00E3)">ã</span></span>,
<span><span data-code="06D0" data-name="ARABIC LETTER E" title="ARABIC LETTER E (U+06D0)">ې</span></span>, <span><span data-code="4E0D" data-name="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D" title="CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E0D (U+4E0D)">不</span></span> and <span><span data-code="2603" data-name="SNOWMAN" title="SNOWMAN (U+2603)">☃</span></span>. As of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.2.0/">Unicode 6.2</a> there are <strong>109,976</strong> code points!
<em>(You can mouseover any highlighted character for more information.)</em></p>
<p>It also includes <em>combining characters</em> such as <span><span data-code="0300" data-name="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT" title="COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT (U+0300)">◌̀</span></span> which can be added to
other characters; this way, Unicode does not need a code point for every possible
combination of letter and accent. On the other hand, Unicode <em>generally</em> doesn’t care
about fonts or stylistic differences: it gives <img alt="a (double-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a1.png">
and <img alt="a (single-story)" src="https://richardjharris.github.io/static/images/a2.png"> the same codepoint.</p>
<p>It’s <em>more than just a character set</em>: it also covers standard encodings such
as UTF-8; <nobr>lower/upper/title</nobr> case mapping; collation (sorting); line breaks;
rendering; right-to-left script handling, and more.</p>
<h2>Normalization</h2>
<p>For compatibility with other encodings Unicode sometimes includes <em>precomposed</em>
versions of characters, for example, these three:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span data-code="00C5" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)">Å</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (U+00C5)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="212B" data-name="ANGSTROM SIGN" title="ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)">Å</span><span> ANGSTROM SIGN (U+212B)</span></span></li>
<li><span><span data-code="0041" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)">A</span><span> LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)</span></span> + <span><span data-code="030A" data-name="COMBINING RING ABOVE" title="COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)">◌̊</span><span> COMBINING RING ABOVE (U+030A)</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>For these to be treated as the same string in equality tests etc. you should
run all input through <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalisation</a>. The most common form is
<abbr title="Normalisation Form C (canonical decomposition + canonical composition)">NFC</abbr>, which uses pre<strong>C</strong>omposed characters where possible, and defines a strict ordering
of diacritics if more than one exists. <abbr title="Normalization Form D (canonical decomposition)">NFD</abbr> <strong>D</strong>ecomposes characters where possible.<sup id="fnref:gory"><a href="#fn:gory" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what form you use as long as you are consistent; NFD is
faster in general (fewer codepoints) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129/74496">tchrist</a> suggests running input
through NFD and output through NFC.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility decomposition</strong> also maps characters such as <span><span data-code="FB03" data-name="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI" title="LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI (U+FB03)">ﬃ</span></span>, <span><span data-code="2168" data-name="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE" title="ROMAN NUMERAL NINE (U+2168)">Ⅸ</span></span>
and even <span><span data-code="2075" data-name="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE" title="SUPERSCRIPT FIVE (U+2075)">⁵</span></span> to ‘ffi’, ‘IX’ and ‘5’ respectively. This <abbr title="Normalization Form KC (compatibility decomposition + canonical composition)">NFKC</abbr> normalisation
helps when searching for text.</p>

</pre></div>


<h2>Casefolding</h2>
<p>Casing is not so simple in the Unicode world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some strings actually change length when they change case: <span><span data-code="00DF" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S (U+00DF)">ß</span></span> uppercases
  to ‘SS’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="017F" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S (U+017F)">ſ</span><span> LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S</span></span> should be seen as equal to ‘s’ and ‘S’ in case-insensitive comparisons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><span data-code="03A3" data-name="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3)">Σ</span><span> GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA</span></span> has <em>two</em> lowercase forms: <span><span data-code="03C3" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA (U+03C3)">σ</span></span> at the beginning or middle of the
  word, and <span><span data-code="03C2" data-name="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA" title="GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2)">ς</span></span> at the end of a word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casing is <em>mostly</em> consistent across locales, but Turkish is an exception: it
  has both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I">Dotted and dotless I</a>, in both lower and upper cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure your code handles these cases, and any new ones, Unicode provides a
<em>one-way</em> ‘casefold’ operation that allows case-insensitive comparison:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::</span><span>CaseFold</span><span>;</span>   <span># or: use v5.16;</span>
<span>sort</span> <span>{</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$a</span><span>)</span> <span>cmp</span> <span>fc</span><span>(</span><span>$b</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>@stuff</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Casefolding does <em>not</em> include normalization, so do that too.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>Sorting (or <em>collation</em>) is <strong>locale specific</strong> and just as riddled with
pecularities as casing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>German and Swedish both have ä and ö but sort them differently - German
    treats them as variants of the same letters without umlauts (i.e. ‘a<strong>ä</strong>bcdefghijklmno<strong>ö</strong>pqrstuvwxyz’)
    whereas Swedish considers them new letters, and puts them at the end (‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<strong>äö</strong>‘)</p>
<p>It’s important that things are sorted in the order the user expects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorting varies by application too; phonebooks are often sorted differently to book
    indices, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Chinese characters and other ideographs, there are many possible orders, e.g.
    pinyin (phonetic), by stroke count, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collations can be <em>tailored</em> based on user preferences, e.g. lower or upper-case first?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not enough to just sort by binary comparison. And codepoints aren’t generally in any
sensible order either. Fortunately Unicode specifies a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/">Collation Algorithm</a>
that is immensely customisable, covers all the edge-cases, and does clever things to make
it reasonably fast. Here’s an example:<sup id="fnref:locale"><a href="#fn:locale" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>
<span>use</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>;</span>
<span>my</span> <span>$collator</span> <span>=</span> <span>Unicode::Collate::</span><span>Locale</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>locale</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>'DE'</span><span>);</span>
<span>my</span> <span>@sorted</span> <span>=</span> <span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>sort</span><span>(</span><span>@array</span><span>);</span>
<span>$collator</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cmp</span><span>(</span><span>$word</span><span>,</span> <span>$another_word</span><span>);</span>  <span># -&gt; -1, 0 or 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <abbr title="Unicode Collation Algorithm">UCA</abbr> can do other clever things, such as sort ‘10’ after ‘2’ numerically, or sort
the character ‘?’ as if it was the string ‘question mark’.</p>
<h2>Encodings</h2>
<p>The big ones are <code>UTF-8</code>, <code>UTF-16</code> and <code>UTF-32</code>. Each one guarantees a reversible
mapping of almost every codepoint<sup id="fnref:every"><a href="#fn:every" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to a byte sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-32</strong> is dead simple: each codepoint gets four bytes. Takes up tons of space,
  not recommended for interchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-8</strong> is very common the web. It’s byte-oriented (no endianness issues),
  handles corruption well, is ASCII-compatible and takes up minimal space for text
  that is mostly ASCII (e.g. HTML).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Code points between U+0800 and U+FFFF, which includes commonly used <abbr title="Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese">CJKV</abbr>
  characters, will take up 3 bytes instead of 2. So UTF-16 may be more space
  efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASCII-compatibility is helpful to allow UTF-8 to stealth its way through
  scripts and processes that are not Unicode-aware. But if such a system tries to
  do anything with the data (casing, sub-strings, regex), that data may be
  corrupted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UTF-16</strong> is used by Java, .NET and Windows. It uses 2 bytes (16-bit) to
  represent the most common 63K codepoints, and 4 bytes for the less common 1M
  codepoints (using two ‘surrogate’ codepoints).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, UTF-16 is not a fixed-width encoding. But as
  long as it contains no surrogates, it can be treated as one, which can speed
  up string operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTF-16 streams typically begin with <span><span data-code="FEFF" data-name="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE" title="ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE (U+FEFF)">U+FEFF</span></span><sup id="fnref:bomnote"><a href="#fn:bomnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to detect the endianness
  (byte order) of the stream. Otherwise, you can explicitly encode or decode
  via ‘UTF-16BE’ or ‘UTF-16LE’ to specify the endianness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unicode and internationalised domain names</h2>
<p>International characters create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">big problem</a>
for domain names. Just as <span><span data-code="0049" data-name="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I" title="LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I (U+0049)">I</span></span> and <span><span data-code="006C" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER L" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER L (U+006C)">l</span></span> look similar, Unicode multiplies that problem
by 1,000, in addition to adding numerous invisible control characters, spacing characters
and right-to-left text.</p>
<p>Browsers and registrars have implemented several measures against this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many TLDs restrict which characters can be used in domain names.</li>
<li>Browsers may display the domain in Punycode (see below) if the domain includes characters
  from multiple scripts and/or characters not belonging to one of the user’s preferred languages.</li>
<li>Internationalised country codes such as .рф (Russia) only accept Cyrillic names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>nameprep/stringprep</h3>
<p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3491">RFC 3491</a> defines <em>nameprep</em>, a mechanism
to case-fold, normalize and sanitize strings before they can be used in domain names. This
removes many invisible characters and throws an error if prohibited code points are in use.</p>
<p>It is implemented in terms of a wider framework called <em>stringprep</em>. In Perl, one can use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Net::IDN::Encode">Net::IDN::Encode</a> which will also perform Punycode conversion.</p>
<h3>Punycode</h3>
<p>For legacy reasons DNS does not allow extended characters outside of ASCII, so Punycode
is an ASCII-compatible encoding scheme. For example, <code>café.com</code> becomes <code>xn--caf-dma.com</code>.
All Punycode-encoded domain components are instantly recognisable by their <code>xn--</code> prefix.</p>
<p>This goes for TLDs too: .中国 is really known as <em>xn—fiqs8s</em>.</p>
<h2>The problem of ‘user characters’</h2>
<p>In Perl at least, everything (<code>substr</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>reverse</code>…) works on the level
of codepoints. This is often not what you want, because what a user considers to be a
character such as ў is actually two codepoints (<span><span data-code="0079" data-name="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y" title="LATIN SMALL LETTER Y (U+0079)">y</span></span> + <span><span data-code="0306" data-name="COMBINING BREVE" title="COMBINING BREVE (U+0306)">◌̆</span></span>). Here’s a <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/10/msg178687.html">really good
usenet post</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Even seemingly innocuous things like <code>printf "%-10s", $str</code> breaks completely for combining characters,
double-width characters (e.g. Chinese/Japanese) or zero-width characters.</p>
<p>Fortunately Perl provides the <code>\X</code> regular expression metachar which matches exactly one
‘extended grapheme cluster’, i.e. what a user would consider a character to be. A more robust
solution is to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::GCString">Unicode::GCString</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span>#!/usr/bin/perl</span>

<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<p>Line breaking (or word wrapping) is another thing that becomes <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/">insanely complicated</a>
once Unicode is involved. You have to account for various non-breaking and breaking control
and spacing characters, punctuation in every language (e.g. <span><span data-code="00AB" data-name="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="LEFT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00AB)">«</span></span> and <span><span data-code="00BB" data-name="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK" title="RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+00BB)">»</span></span> quotes, or the
full stop or comma being used in numerics such as <code>2,140</code>) and the width of each character.</p>
<p>In Perl, this has all been handled for you - just use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Unicode::LineBreak">Unicode::LineBreak</a>.</p>
<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
<p>Some useful Perl regular expression syntax:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>\R</code></dt>
<dd>Match any Unicode linebreak sequence (including <code>\n</code>, <code>\r\n</code> and six others)</dd>
<dt><code>\p</code>, <code>\P</code></dt>
<dd>Match any codepoint possessing (or not possessing) a Unicode property.</dd>
<dd>Common ones are <code>\pL</code> (Letter), <code>\pU</code> (Uppercase), <code>\pS</code> (Symbol), or even <code>\p{script=Latin}</code>,
<code>\p{East_Asian_Width=Wide}</code>, <code>\p{Numeric_Value=4}</code>.</dd>
<dd>See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perluniprops.html">perluniprops</a> for a big list.</dd>
<dd>Built-in character classes such as <code>\w</code>, <code>\b</code>, <code>\s</code> and <code>\d</code> are Unicode-aware since Perl
5.6 (though you need to make sure your string or pattern has the <code>UTF8</code> flag on!) Disable this
with the <code>/a</code> flag (see <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Character-set-modifiers">perlre</a>).</dd>
<dt><code>\X</code></dt>
<dd>Match an extended grapheme cluster, which is basically …</dd></dl></div></div>

        <p><span>S</span>arah Dolman heard the porpoiseâ€™s cries not in the waters where the animalâ€™s voice was actually recorded, but on the sound system at a marine mammal conference held in late 2019. To Dolman, policy manager at the nonprofit UK-based conservation organization <a href="https://uk.whales.org/" target="_blank">Whale and Dolphin Conservation,</a> time and distance made the experience no less painful.</p>

<p>The porpoise was using its voice—which sounds alternately like a buzzing insect, a creaky door blowing open then clicking shut, and a high-frequency whistle that humans cannot hear without the aid of sound-amplifying technologies—to call to another porpoise who was caught in a fishing net. The entangled porpoise struggled to surface while trying to break free. That proved impossible, and the porpoise drowned. But the dead creatureâ€™s companion stayed nearby for hours, speaking in protracted clicks, buzzes and whistles—in mourning or perhaps confusion, alarmed by the sudden death of its friend.</p>
<p>Globally, fishing gear kills <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123735539000444" target="_blank">at least 300,000 marine mammals</a> every year, and leaves many more individuals with scars both physical and psychological. Some governments, including those of the U.S. and E.U., may temporarily close fisheries or regulate gear after a specified number of marine mammals are killed, but those measures are limited. At a moment when the cruel captivity of several dozen orcas inspires public outrage and aquarium boycotts and new laws, the global fishing industry and its regulators generally accept the widespread killing and maiming of marine mammals as a part of doing business. And so we unwittingly continue to eat fish, in huge amounts, and marine mammals continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Dolman says present approaches, which focus on maintaining specific populations above a minimum size, still allow too much killing and preventable suffering. She says itâ€™s time for fisheries policies to consider the welfare of individual whales and dolphins and other marine mammals. â€œBeing caught in fishing gear is a horrible way to die,â€� says Dolman. â€œHow would the public feel about this when theyâ€™re eating fish and seafood, if they knew about these animalsâ€™ suffering? We need another solution.â€�</p>
<p>Dolman and her colleague Philippa Brakes, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, outlined their approach for regulating â€œbycatch,â€� as unintentionally caught animals are called, and preventing entanglement in fishing gear in a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00287/full" target="_blank">2018 paper</a> published in the journal <em>Frontiers in Veterinary Science</em>. They say that fisheries policies must account for the well-being of individuals, not just populations, ideally with zero tolerance for marine mammal bycatch.</p>
<p>They also argue for updating the definition of â€œsustainableâ€� fisheries, now set according to whether the exploitation of a given fish population can be continued without jeopardizing it, to include marine mammals killed as bycatch. In their paper, Dolman and Brakes point out that â€œbuying â€˜sustainableâ€™ fish or indeed some fish products labeled â€˜dolphin-friendlyâ€™ provide no guarantees that incidental bycatch of protected species does not occur alongside the targeted catch.â€�&nbsp; And not only should sustainability encompass mortality, but also the suffering of survivors—something thatâ€™s a bit more challenging to measure, though scientists acknowledge that itâ€™s real, and goes beyond the pain of scars and severed limbs caused by the constricting ropes of the gear they carry.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_911411818e26b80488c996ad7cfe7d4d.jpg" alt="nautilus whale calf"><figcaption><span>A humpback whale mother swims with her newborn calf in their traditional breeding waters in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. </span><br><span>Credit: NOAA News</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even if we are quite far from fully understanding the experiences of animals who spend their lives primarily underwater, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-31011-0_10" target="_blank">research clearly reveals</a> that harbor porpoises like the one whose cries haunted Dolman and other marine mammals are, like us, highly intelligent and social creatures. Ecologist and author <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/review-beyond-words-carl-safina.html" target="_blank">Carl Safina</a>, who has written extensively about the inner lives of nonhuman animals including orcas and sperm whales, says the loss of even one individual whale—particularly if she happens to be an adult female—can be catastrophic for others.<br></p>
<p>â€œSperm whales stay together their entire lives, very intentionally living together in a family the way elephants live together in a family,â€� says Safina. â€œIf you lose even one member of that female support group, you increase the risks and hazards to the young ones.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like baby humans, young marine mammals depend on their eldersâ€™ vigilance and protection, as well as their practical knowledge and cultural wisdom, for survival. Older animals in a family bestow younger members with all sorts of knowhow, such as what to eat and how to hunt for food. Scientists have discovered that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1313" target="_blank">orca grandmothers</a> play an outsized role in the lives of young orcas, boosting youngstersâ€™ chances of survival. Even for less family-oriented marine mammal species, like humpback whales, notes Safina, â€œthe death of a mother—or severe distress of a mother due to entanglement in fishing gear—can be, depending on age of a young one, completely devastating or very stressful.â€�
</p>
<p>Research like this â€œopens a rich seam of understanding,â€� Brakes says. â€œSuch understanding shows us that we can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€� She and Dolman propose a multi-pronged strategy of implementing fisheries closures and new fishing practices, as well as requiring new gear that minimizes bycatch and entanglements. Fisheries regulation would need to include enhanced monitoring and reporting systems that keep track of every harmed marine mammal. Right now basic data about bycatch and entanglements, much less the long-term physiological and psychological affects, are not being collected.</p>
<blockquote>â€œWe can no longer treat marine mammals like a homogenous group or numbers on a spreadsheet.â€�</blockquote>
<p>According to Dolman, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a key independent labeler of sustainable seafood, has received much criticism in recent years about its inadequate consideration of bycatch. â€œMSC bycatch standards are under review at the moment,â€� Dolman said. â€œThis is something thatâ€™s long overdue. But, I have to say, Iâ€™m not feeling very positive about whatâ€™s coming. The fishing industry is very vocal and oppositional to regulatory change. Consumers and scientists must begin pushing for laws and certification schemes to seriously incorporate welfare into the â€˜sustainableâ€™ label. Most of the public feels comfortable when they see a dolphin-safe label—though really, right now, they shouldnâ€™t.â€�<strong>
</strong></p>
<p>Adding to marine mammalsâ€™ collective challenges is the fact that fishing isnâ€™t their only threat. In addition to depleting populations of the fish they eat, humans have made the oceans a much noisier place, with engine noise and seismic surveys and naval tests causing both chronic stress and acute damage. We push ship traffic into ever-more remote areas once only known to marine animals; disrupt marine life by developing coastlines and dredging channels; pollute with plastic and toxic chemicals; and cause ocean-warming climate change.
</p>
<p>These are not matters to frame purely in terms of populations and environments, but the lived experiences of animals who share many intellectual properties with us. â€œPeople need to understand that other living things can suffer and that these individuals donâ€™t want to suffer. They want to exist in a state of wellbeing. Thatâ€™s what they strive to do,â€� says Safina. â€œI think the big first step is for people to understand and talk about that and drive away from things that cause suffering.â€�</p>

    &nbsp; — &nbsp;
    June 21, 2020
  </p>
  <p>I show how to use heterogeneous lists and traits to implement a type-safe printf in Rust. These mechanisms can ensure that two variadic argument lists share important properties, like the number of format string holes matches the number of printf arguments.</p>
  <p><em>Part of an ongoing series about type-level programming in Rust. Consider reading <a href="http://willcrichton.net/notes/type-level-programming/">part one</a> first! All code in this note can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/willcrichton/e7fcf1b0e84b4be7f172f0e0245cf149">this gist</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rust has a great printf function, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>. It has a rich formatting language, but also catches mistakes at compile-time. For example, <code>println!</code> will check that the number of arguments matches the number of holes in the format string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: 2 positional arguments in format string, but there is 1 argument
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:36:13
   |
36 |   println!("{} {}", "Hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does the Rust compiler make this check? Because both the format string and the argument are within the macro, Rust will check that the number of holes matches the number of arguments. Consequently, format strings <em>have</em> to be within the macro. If we write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"{} {}"</span><span>;</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>"hi"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: format argument must be a string literal
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:42:12
   |
42 |   println!(s, "hi");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ll show you how to implement type-safe printf without using procedural macros. More generally, this note contains a Rust recipe for functions where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arguments are variadic</li>
  <li>Each argument can be a different type (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> not allowed)</li>
  <li>Multiple variadic inputs share a parallel property, e.g. the number of arguments should match the number of format holes</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="core-mechanism-hlist">Core mechanism: HList</h2>

<p>First, we need to understand the main type-level mechanism: a heterogeneous list (or H-list). An H-list is a sequence of values of potentially different types. For example, <code>[1, "a", true]</code> is an H-list, but not a valid Rust vector. H-lists are implemented in Rust using a linked-list style:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>HNil</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>,</span> <span>Tail</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>Head</span><span>,</span>
  <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>Tail</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>let</span> <span>example</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>,</span> <span>HNil</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>{</span><span>head</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>tail</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>}};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key idea is that the type of an H-list changes every time you make a change to it. By contrast, if you push to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, the type of the vector stays the same.</p>

<p>Just like Rust has <code>vec![]</code>, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk#hlist">frunk</a> crate to get an <code>hlist!</code> macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>true</span><span>];</span> <span>// same as above</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="setting-up-printf">Setting up printf</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the ingredients of printf. We need a format string and an argument list. The key idea is to represent both with an H-list, and carefully use Rust’s traits to ensure our desired property: the number of arguments should match the number of holes.</p>

<p>First, to represent format strings, we will have a sequence of structs that represent each part of the string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Assume that we compile "Hello {}! The first prime is {}" into this code.</span>
<span>// That would be a simple syntactic transformation.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To represent arguments, we will use a matching H-list of values. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, our goal is to create a function <code>format</code> such that this is true:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And this should be a compile-time (NOT run-time) error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"Only one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-format-trait">The Format trait</h2>

<p>In the spirit of type-level computation, we start by defining a trait.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code>self</code> is the H-list of the format directives, and <code>ArgList</code> is the H-list of the variadic arguments. <code>Format</code> need to take <code>ArgList</code> as a type parameter, because its type will change as we remove elements from the <code>ArgList</code> list.</p>

<p>Now, we proceed to implement the <code>Format</code> trait by cases. First, the base case for reaching the end of the format list <code>HNil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HNil</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>HNil</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HNil</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>""</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This impl says that when we reach the end of a format list, just return the empty string. And the only argument we will accept is an empty argument list. Combined with the next impls, this inductively ensures that extra arguments are not accepted.</p>

<p>Next, we will implement <code>FString</code>. This implementation should use the string constant contained in the <code>FString</code> struct, and combine it recursively with the rest of the format list. We don’t use variadic arguments for <code>FString</code>, so they get passed along. In Rust, this English specification becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FString</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.head</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.to_owned</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we have to add <code>FmtList: Format&lt;ArgList&gt;</code> to ensure the recursive call to <code>self.tail.format</code> works. Also note that we aren’t implementing <code>Format</code> directly on <code>FString</code>, but rather on an H-list containing <code>FString</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex case, <code>FVar</code>. We want this impl to take an argument from the <code>ArgList</code>, then format the remaining format list with the remaining arguments.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>ToString</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>args</span><span>.head</span><span>.to_string</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Be careful to observe which H-list is being accessed by <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>. Here, the <code>args</code> H-list provides the data to fill the hole via <code>args.head</code>.</p>

<h2 id="checking-our-properties">Checking our properties</h2>

<p>With this implementation, our correct example successfully compiles and runs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>example</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span>
  <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>,</span> <span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"! The first prime is "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span>
<span>];</span>
<span>assert_eq!</span><span>(</span>
  <span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"world"</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>]),</span>
  <span>"Hello world! The first prime is 2"</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about our incorrect example? If we write this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>example</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"just one arg"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code fails to compile with the error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/printf.rs:48:18
   |
48 |   example.format(hlist!["just one arg"]);
   |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                  expected struct `Cons`, found struct `HNil`
   |
   = note: expected struct `HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;`
              found struct `HNil`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the error is enigmatic, our mistake is at least correctly caught at compile-time. This is because Rust deduces that <code>example.format()</code> expects an H-list of the shape <code>HCons&lt;_, HCons&lt;_, HNil&gt;&gt;</code>, but it finds <code>HNil</code> too soon in our 1-element H-list. A similar error occurs when providing too many args.</p>

<p>Stupendous! We have successfully implemented a type-safe printf using H-lists and traits.</p>

<h2 id="extending-our-abstraction">Extending our abstraction</h2>

<p>Right now, our <code>Format</code> function just checks that the format list and argument list are the same length. We could extend our format structures, for example to ensure that an <code>FVar</code> must be a particular type, or must use <code>Debug</code> vs. <code>Display</code>. Here’s the sketch of such a strategy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>use</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Add flags for whether using Display or Debug</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FDebug</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Use a type parameter with PhantomData to represent the intended type</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Flag</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// Now, T has to be the same between the format list and arg list</span>
<span>// Also, FDisplay flag requires that `T: Display`</span>
<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>for</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>FVar</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>FmtList</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
  <span>FmtList</span><span>:</span> <span>Format</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Display</span><span>,</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>fn</span> <span>format</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>:</span> <span>HCons</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>ArgList</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// using format! is cheating, but you get the idea</span>
    <span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>.tail</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>.tail</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Similar impl for `T: Debug` when `FDebug` is used</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this approach, if our format list and arg list differ in type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>FString</span><span>(</span><span>"n: "</span><span>),</span> <span>FVar</span><span>::</span><span>&lt;</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>FDisplay</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>)];</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.format</span><span>(</span><span>hlist!</span><span>[</span><span>"not a number"</span><span>]);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the code will not compile with the error, <code>&amp;'static str is not i32</code>.</p>

<p>Shout-out to <a href="https://www.servant.dev/posts/2018-07-12-servant-dsl-typelevel.html">this blog post</a> from Haskell’s servant framework which got me thinking about adapting their strategy into Rust.</p>

<p>There are three types of infrastructure. One is visible: roads, dams and bridges. The second is invisible: broadband internet provisions and the entirety of our cellular infrastructure. Both are still vital in building our present. The third form of infrastructure is one being rebuilt in order to be repurposed for future use. I explained in <em>J-Curves and Agglomeration</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Postal Service is a key component of the eCommerce economy. Packages are just 5% of its shipping volume but eCommerce accounts for nearly 30% of the agency’s revenue. Partnerships with vendors like Amazon (or providers like FedEx and UPS) provide a majority of its package volume but small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands rely on USPS’ pricing. Raising costs on retailers may lead to more attrition. […]</p>
<p>By raising prices to combat Amazon’s growing influence over the economy, disrupting the postal economy is no different than digging up paved roads before a period of heightened freight transit. [<a href="https://2pml.com/2020/05/18/agglomeration/">2PM, 1</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Postal Service is all three. When an American institution is 250 years old, it may as well be the ground that we stand on. The service has contributed services and innovations that we don’t readily attribute to it. Consider its contribution to the middle class: the U.S. Postal Service is one the country’s biggest employers with nearly 330,000 career employees and an average salary of $50,000. They are building the future of eCommerce, a still-nascent industry.</p>
<p>Critics of the USPS will cite cost of labor as a reason for the service’s obsolescence. A common refrain is “Why couldn’t Amazon takeover the service?” Consider that in the fourth quarter of 2019, eCommerce was just 11.9% of all retail. Amazon constituted right under half of that volume. And without the postal service, Amazon would not exist. The market costs of shipment subsidized a number of Amazon’s operations, allowing it to capture market share.</p>
<h2>“The Ground We Stand On”</h2>
<p>The postal service began before the founding of the United States. Benjamin Franklin was fired from his role as postmaster due to his involvement with the American Revolution. Just one year later in 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Franklin the Postmaster General of the “United Colonies.” His tenure left a mail system that offered service between the then-colonies and Great Britain. By 1802, the first African-Americans to work for the Postal Service were enslaved mail carriers. Senator James Jackson of Georgia, Chairman of the Committee of the Senate on the Post Office Establishment, once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>… The most active and intelligent [slaves] are employed as post riders. By travelling from day to day, and hourly mixing with people […] they will acquire information. They will learn that a man’s rights do not depend on his color. They will, in time, become teachers to their brethren.</p></blockquote>
<p>Within two months of Senator Jackson’s proclamation, African-Americans would be banned from the postal service, lasting from 1802 to March 1865, just one month before the conclusion of the Civil War. This disbarment ended by congressional decree.</p>
<blockquote><p>No person, by reason of color, shall be disqualified from employment in carrying the mails. (13 Stat. 515)</p></blockquote>
<p>The next decades would see an unparalleled push for African-American financial stability. Nearly 800 would serve as postal employees prior to the 20th century. More than 200 African Americans are known to have served in the high rank of postmaster prior to the conclusion of Reconstruction and the Progressive Era (1863-1920). Of them, nearly 20 were women. The postal service has always been politicized.</p>
<p>Soon after, the U.S. Government expanded on the postal service’s role in democratizing America, both literally and figuratively. President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt expanded on this with the <em>Square Deal</em> in 1902, communicating a fairness policy in hiring and leadership. The result was momentous for many. Roosevelt stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is and should be my consistent policy in every State, where their numbers warranted it, to recognize colored men of good repute and standing in making appointments to office. […] I can not consent to take the position that the door of hope – the door of opportunity – is to be shut upon any man, no matter how worthy, purely upon the grounds of race or color. <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/african-american-workers-20thc.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, 21% (or nearly 70,000) of the agency’s employees are African-American. However, the postal service was consequential beyond matters of social equity. By 1823, the U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Government established 80,000 miles of “post roads” to help carriers navigate new rural areas. By 1860, these roads connected nearly 28,000 post offices. Today, the postal service maintains nearly 40,000 post offices, clearing 212 billion letters and mail to 144 million homes.</p>

<p>Save the @USPS.There is no institution more critical to the next phases of our commerce economy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, the service is tasked with another generational shift: supporting online retail. The pandemic shifted the American consumer towards online retail, this while reducing the number of units shipped. As such, companies like UPS and FedEx have responded by hiking prices. In response to USPS’ distress, FedEx recently stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mail volumes and mix resulting in a further decrease in revenues and negative financial impact for the USPS. Additionally, the USPS continues to experience budgetary uncertainty as well as increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of its operations.</p>

<p>Cost inflation is the most concerning obstacle ahead for digitally native retailers. Without the treatment that the United States’ oldest civilian service afforded Amazon in its infancy, it will be more difficult to build more businesses of Amazon’s scale. The economics were difficult enough as is; these added costs will only add pressure to pass along costs to consumers, many of whom are facing down one of the most economically vulnerable periods since 2008.We should consider the postal service an investment into our present and future and a monument to our past.</p>
<p>If our economy is to begin addressing the shortfalls caused by the overwhelming contraction in the traditional retail industry, it will need the support of the postal service. For eCommerce, their service is the industry’s last mile for thousands of direct-to-consumer small businesses. The postal service uniquely sits at the intersection of our physical roads and our digital infrastructure. There isn’t a direct substitute and we shouldn’t wait to find out the hard way. Save the USPS. We will need more companies like the the successful hundreds that were built on its 250 year old infrastructure. That includes Amazon.</p>
