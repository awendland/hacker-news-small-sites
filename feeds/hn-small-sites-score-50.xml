<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>If selling products online is a core part of your business, then you need to build an e-commerce data model that’s scalable, flexible, and fast. Most off-the-shelf providers like Shopify and BigCommerce are built for small stores selling a few million dollars in orders per month, so many e-commerce retailers working at scale start to investigate creating a bespoke solution.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This article will look at what it takes to start building this infrastructure on your own. What are some of the areas to consider? What might the data model look like? How much work is involved?</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll explore an alternative: API-based commerce platforms that manage data for you across product catalogs, pricing, and orders—without locking you into a monolith, and without requiring you to replatform.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> A full summary diagram of the e-commerce data model is at the end of the article.</em></p>

<h2 id="who-are-your-customers-">Who Are Your Customers?</h2>
<p>First, you need to consider <em>who</em> will be purchasing items from your e-commerce application. How might you model customer information in a database as a result? You’ll probably want to have basic information like your customer's name, email address, etc. Do you want your customers to be able to create a profile in your system? Or just fill out a form each time they want to purchase something?</p>
<p>Just starting out, a basic model might look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="Basic e-commerce customer data model" width="308" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=154&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 154w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 308w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=462&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 462w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=616&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 616w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=770&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 770w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=924&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px"></p>
<p>If you want your customers to have a persistent profile, then you need to build some way for them to log in to your application. Moving forward with more real-world requirements, you might also want to keep track of their login attempt history and password history.</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce customer data model" width="891" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=446&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 446w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 891w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1337&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1337w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1782&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1782w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2228&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2228w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2673&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2673w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></p>
<p>You might also want to consider whether your customers are part of a large organization; and, if so, how would they like to handle password resets? Do they need single sign-on or OAuth support?</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-addresses">Deep Dive: Addresses</h4>
<p>Did you notice there’s no address tied to a customer in any of the data models shown so far? It might be your first inclination to include a customer’s address as part of those models. However, most customers will have multiple addresses and multiple <em>kinds</em> of addresses, like billing and shipping. B2B retailers might also have to consider multiple delivery locations based on the number of warehouses and offices they support.</p>
<p>What happens if the billing and shipping address are different? Well, you’ll need to do more than just add extra columns to the <code>Customer</code> table! It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>So how <em>does</em> storing a billing address affect the scalability of your application?</p>
<p>If you were to split the payment and shipping areas into separate (micro)services each having their own database, then putting billing and payment addresses into the <code>Customer</code> area would lead to having “chatty” services. This is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/chattiness.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-known <em>design smell</em> when building microservices</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, you’re better off putting the addresses within the appropriate area/service that requires them, but with that, your data model becomes more complex.</p>
<p>One way to avoid much of this complexity is to consider an <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/oms-software" rel="noopener">order management system (OMS)</a> by an API-first software provider. With this software, you can integrate the OMS into your data model without spending months of engineering time.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-organize-products-and-catalog-">How Do You Organize Products And Catalog?</h2>
<p>The first thing you see when you enter a store (either in-person or digitally) are products ready for you to purchase, and usually displayed with some thought for how you might be likely to shop.</p>
<p>For an e-commerce web application, you will probably want to highlight things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best selling products</li>
<li>Trending products</li>
<li>New products</li>
<li>The ability to browse products by search criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing customers with that information means you first need to keep track of a lot of data about your products: their prices, historical purchase data, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a “first shot” at creating a data model for a product catalog might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="Simple e-commerce product data model" width="562" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=281&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 281w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 562w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=843&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 843w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1124&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1124w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1405&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1405w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1686&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1686w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"></p>
<p>Here’s a <code>Product</code> table with some basic information, like a product’s name, SKU, and price. The product is also linked to another table representing various categories that product is associated with. You might also strategically add indexes and full-text search to the <code>Product</code> table to enable site visitors to efficiently search for various products.</p>
<p>This is a decent first attempt. However, to get an even more realistic and useful e-commerce product catalog, you’ll need to support more requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking pricing history so site administrators can analyze trends in product pricing</li>
<li>Supporting related products to display on a product’s page</li>
<li>Incorporating product vendors so customers can view all products sold by an individual vendor/company</li>
</ul>
<p>To address those extra requirements, you might end up with the following data model:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce product data model" width="816" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=408&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 408w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 816w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1224&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1632&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1632w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2040&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2040w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2448&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2448w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px"></p>
<p>This model still isn’t perfect as it embeds your prices into the product itself, but at least it lets you maintain a previous pricing history.</p>
<p>Another option is to integrate your e-commerce store with a <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/promotions-engine" rel="noopener">pricing and promotions engine</a> from an API-first software provider that handles pricing for you. This will let you roll out different prices to different users based on their intent, location, cart, or order history.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-pricing">Deep Dive: Pricing</h4>
<p>While the more complex product data model still has a product’s price in the same table, this may not be the best thing to do in a real large-scale application.</p>
<p>Consider that your organization has various departments, such as inventory/warehousing, sales, marketing, customer support, etc. You might have dedicated systems that allow merchandisers to change the price of an item since they are the experts in determining how much a product should sell for. Similar to the considerations with a customer’s billing and shipping addresses, this would lead to cross-boundary/service communication if we left the price in the core <code>Product</code> table.</p>
<p>Therefore, you might want to store product prices under the data stores that the sales department owns. But don’t forget, there are many different kinds of “prices” that haven’t been taken into consideration yet, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price (cost) when purchasing stock from vendors</li>
<li>Customer sale price</li>
<li>Discounted sale prices</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s suggested retail price</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling all these in context of your organizational structure would require even more exploration and complexity in your data model. While your engineering team could likely accomplish this task, it’s going to take time. Using ready-made solutions can shave weeks or months off your e-commerce data modeling timeline.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-streamline-orders-">How Do You Streamline Orders?</h2>
<p>Now that you have customers in your database and products available to purchase, you’ll need to think about how to design the order-taking process and data model.</p>
<p>The process of placing an order might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer places products into their cart while browsing.</li>
<li>The customer decides they want to purchase the products that are in their cart.</li>
<li>They proceed to purchase the order.</li>
<li>The customer gets an emailed receipt or confirmation number.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s rarely so simple. Placing orders can be deceptively tricky as there are many moving parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>An active cart</li>
<li>Cart converted into an order</li>
<li>A finalized order with confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to look at a simple data model for an order placement, it might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png" alt="Orders data model" width="837" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=419&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 419w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 837w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1256&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1256w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1674&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1674w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2093&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2093w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2511&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2511w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"></p>
<p>Notice that each row in the <code>ShoppingCartItem</code> table contains the “captured” price of the product. When the customer puts an item into their shopping cart should the price at that moment be “locked-in”? If so, for how long?</p>
<p><em><span>Note:</span> How the price functions is a business requirement that would need to be discussed with your product owners, and so on, as mentioned in the "Deep Dive: Pricing" section earlier.</em></p>
<p>The same question applies to an unpaid order. If a customer has ordered a discounted item, should they be able to keep the promise of that discounted price forever until they pay? Or does it expire?</p>
<p>Other questions to consider for an orders data model might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you tracking analytics on orders?</li>
<li>What happens if a customer returns a defective item?</li>
<li>Should you handle shipping within the same data model or have a dedicated shipping context/schema?</li>
</ul>
<p>With some of these concerns in mind, you might end up with a data model that looks more like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex orders data model" width="1112" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=556&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 556w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1112w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1668&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1668w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2224&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2780&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2780w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=3336&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 3336w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></p>
<p>Some things to take note of in this more complex orders model:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShoppingCartItem</code> now supports an expiration date for a locked-in price.</li>
<li><code>ShoppingCartHistory</code> tracks when items are added, removed, etc.</li>
<li>An order item may be returned (this still does not handle cases where 1 out of X items of the same product are returned).</li>
<li>An order may have multiple shipments (eg, how Amazon will sometimes split an order up into multiple packages/shipments).</li>
</ul>
<p>This article also hasn’t even touched the surface of using alternative data storage methods like JSON documents or event sourcing!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To help you see how all the pieces fit together, here are all the diagrams shown together. I’ve removed a number of links/lines to the <code>Customer</code> table to increase readability:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=1396&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png" alt="Summary e-commerce data model" width="1396" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=698&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 698w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=1396&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 1396w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=2094&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 2094w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=2792&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 2792w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=3490&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 3490w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=4188&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 4188w" sizes="(max-width: 1396px) 100vw, 1396px"></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this article still doesn’t even cover many of the basics like payment processing and invoicing. Beyond the features covered here, you might eventually require more advanced features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupon codes</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Third-party integrations with OAuth providers, other retailers, or partners</li>
<li>Shipment tracking notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a data model for an e-commerce application, as you can see, is not so simple. What looks up front to be a straightforward set of database tables is not so simple once you dig into real-world requirements.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

          <h2 id="changing-license-from-gplv3-to-apache-20-terminusdb">Changing License from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0: TerminusDB</h2>

<p>We have decided to re-license TerminusDB from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0. We want independent software developers (ISVs) to embed TerminusDB in their applications and those developers feel that Apache is a lower risk option. The substantive points of practical difference are far less important – sufficient people believe it to be true and sufficient lawyers have advised teams to be wary of GPL.</p>

<p>In our experience, ISVs and devs in large companies/institutions size up their options at project conception and there remains a niggling doubt that ‘GPL might limit commercial prospects and cause me headaches’. The world has changed – and code freedom is being overtaken by developer freedom.</p>

<p>Open-source software is everywhere. It’s eating the world. In the top 10 databases on <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">DB-Engines</a>, the remaining proprietary databases were released in 1980 (Oracle), 1983 (IBM Db2) and 1989 (Microsoft SQL Server). It is hard to imagine another non-OSS database ever entering the top 10.</p>

<p>We had hoped that our association with the principals of the free software movement would result in community adoption and contribution, but that hasn’t really been the case. We see limited community input that relates to our choice of GPL. That might not be too surprising as when you investigate which license to choose on Stackoverflow, you get popular but wrong-headed comments like:</p>

<p><code>the GNU/GPL bunch are generally extremists when you encounter them in the wild.</code></p>

<p><code>don’t use GPL if you want your project to be commercial</code></p>

<p>With the shift to Apache, TerminusDB is, in a sense, becoming more open source as we are removing restrictions on how you can use the software.</p>

<h3 id="debate">Debate</h3>

<p>The core TerminusDB team had a long debate about licenses before the release of 1.0 last year. The main topics of discussion were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The risks of a cloud provider forking the code then hosting the database</li>
<li>What open source means to TerminusDB as a group</li>
<li>What we, as a community of devs and users, are most comfortable with</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-the-big-bad-cloud-providers">1. The big bad cloud providers</h4>

<p>In the past there was an unwritten rule, that big platforms wouldn’t come along and fork open source code and deliver the same product as a service. Unfortunately, those days are gone. AWS in particular has actively sought to offer very similar services to open source products. This led to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/">Confluent</a> (among others) changing their licences to variations of ‘server side’ and moving away from the open-source tradition. They try to say ‘we are still open source, we are just forbidding a specific type of action’, but it can feel like window dressing for ‘we want to sweat our assets’.</p>

<p>Mongo, for example, is hardly suffering – it’s valued at over $15 billion. With such vast resources, they should be (and are) able to compete in the provision of their own database. MongoDB’s technology is more than competitive with AWS’ DocumentDB, and Mongo’s Atlas DBaaS - which runs on AWS infra - has been a huge success.</p>

<p>I’m sure our perspective will shift over time, but from where we’re standing, having a cloud provider launch a competing service would be a sign of enormous success. (And this is not to say that the cloud providers’ parasitic approach to OSS projects is not a genuine problem, it simply acknowledges that you have to be a widely used OSS project before it *becomes* a problem).</p>

<h3 id="2-free-software">2. Free software</h3>

<p>We don’t think it should be our job to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We do think that the software community should be able to access and use TerminusDB.</p>

<p>In 1974 software became copyrightable in the USA. It subsequently became obvious that researchers were giving out software for free, but businesses were not giving back. GNU/GPL came along to provide a new framework for that interface – the software would be free as in freedom (libre). Everybody would be free to modify and distribute, but proprietary additions would not be allowed.</p>

<p>The problem of businesses not giving back remains today.</p>

<p>GPL and copyleft provisions work well when they dominate open-source, but their waning popularity increases the ability for ISVs and corporates to go for more open licensing and for legal teams to write anti-GPL provisions into internal rules. Only significant developer push back can change that reality (and why push back when there are so many OSS options with permissive licenses).</p>

<p>Maybe if <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MySQL">MySQL</a>, its offshoot <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MariaDB">MariaDB</a>, and our graph brothers <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/Neo4j">Neo4j</a> weren’t the only GPL flag flyers in the top 20 databases, it might be easier to gain adoption with GPL; however, the other big OSS players: Postgres, Cassandra, Elastic &amp; Redis all go for less restrictive licenses.</p>

<p>The Affero GPL (AGPL) is treated as an even greater pariah than the GPLv3. The Google internal policy] bans all use of AGPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It reminds of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13421608">this HN comment</a> on the <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">excellent postmortem</a> of the demise of RethinkDB (recommended reading for all OSS folk):</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-hn.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Our graph database brothers and sisters in <a href="https://neo4j.com/open-core-and-neo4j/">Neo4j moved</a> from the AGPL to ‘AGPL with a commons clause’ to GPLv3 to making some of the code proprietary. Getting the right license for an OSS project that also allows for some commercialization is far from straightforward. (As Neo certainly know – check out this <a href="https://public.igovsol.com/neo4j-court-records/graphfoundation/80-main.pdf">current court case about the formerly GPL enterprise code</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn">Grakn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree/db">Fluree</a> are seeing some success with the AGPL. We genuinely wish them well as we know it is a hard path to walk.</p>



<p>We did get some negative feedback about the GPL prior to launch. Some people working in corporates weren’t comfortable and thought that it would prevent them from using Terminus. Our response was – <strong>we didn’t develop for them</strong>. And that remains the case; however, the GPL skeptical environment is pervasive. There is a person who tweets TerminusDB after every release asking when the Apache version will land – I always ask him why he thinks he needs an Apache version and he doesn’t really know… though he has a vague feeling that the application he builds on top will be less valuable.</p>

<p>We thought we would focus on the cloud offering – <a href="https://terminusdb.com/hub/">TerminusHub</a>, which, as SaaS built on the database, has the benefit of being an in-house ‘product’ that doesn’t worry about the license of the underlying software. However, the community wants to build applications on the software and we want to offer an easy way to build a version control and collaboration layer into ISV applications. We think TerminusDB is the perfect infrastructure to build the next <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. We worry about the syncing, versioning and data collaboration – you worry about your users.</p>

<h3 id="why-shift-licenses">Why shift Licenses</h3>

<p>We do not think that our job is to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We still believe that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">“the fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs.”</a></p>

<p>We would welcome a GPL fork of the TerminusDB code – we are happy to work with any such project should it emerge.</p>

<p>But we wish to build a community first and foremost. In order to facilitate that community, we will be moving to Apache 2.0 immediately.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to focus on creating a great open-source database and allow everybody to use that software in their projects.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This post is co-authored by George Fraser, the CEO of <a href="http://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, and Arjun Narayan, the CEO of Materialize. This blog post is cross-posted <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/kafka-is-not-a-database">on the Fivetran blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s important to understand the uses and abuses of streaming infrastructure.</p>
<p>Apache Kafka is a message broker that has rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years. Message brokers have been around for a long time; they’re a type of datastore specialized for “buffering” messages between producer and consumer systems. Kafka has become popular because it’s open-source and capable of scaling to very large numbers of messages.</p>
<p>Message brokers are classically used to decouple producers and consumers of data. For example, at Fivetran, we use a message broker similar to Kafka to buffer customer-generated webhooks before loading them in batches into your data warehouse:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" alt="A Message Broker Used as a buffer before loading into a data warehouse" width="960" height="124" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w"></p>
<p>In this scenario, the message broker is providing durable storage of events between when a customer sends them, and when Fivetran loads them into the data warehouse.</p>
<p>However, Kafka has occasionally been described as something much more than just a better message broker. Proponents of this viewpoint position Kafka as a fundamentally new way of managing data, where <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka replaces the relational database as the definitive record of what has happened</a>. Instead of reading and writing a traditional database, you append events to Kafka, and read from downstream views that represent the present state. This architecture has been described as “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning the database inside out</a>“.</p>
<p>In principle, it is possible to implement this architecture in a way that supports both reads and writes. However, during that process you will eventually confront every hard problem that database management systems have faced for decades. You will more or less have to write a full-fledged DBMS in your application code. And you will probably not do a great job, because databases take years to get right. You will have to deal with dirty reads, phantom reads, write skew, and all the other symptoms of a hastily implemented database.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with using Kafka as your primary data store is it provides no isolation. Isolation means that, globally, all transactions (reads and writes) occur along some consistent history. Jepsen provides a <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">guide</a> of isolation levels (inhabiting an isolation level means that the system will never encounter certain anomalies).</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example of why isolation is important: suppose we’re running an online store. When a user checks out, we want to make sure all their items are actually in stock. The way to do this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the inventory level for each item in the user’s cart.</li>
<li>If an item is no longer available, abort the checkout.</li>
<li>If all items are available, subtract them from the inventory and confirm the checkout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we are using Kafka to manage this process. Our architecture might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" alt="A microservice workflow for processing checkouts" width="960" height="753" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w"></p>
<p>The web server reads the inventory level from a view downstream from Kafka, but it can only commit the transaction <em>upstream</em> in the checkouts topic. The problem is one of <strong>concurrency control</strong>: if there are two users racing to buy the last item, <em>only one must succeed</em>. We need to read the inventory view and confirm the checkout at <em>a single point in time</em>. However, there is no way to do this in this architecture.</p>
<p>The problem we now have is called <a href="http://justinjaffray.com/what-does-write-skew-look-like/">write skew</a>. Our reads from the inventory view can be out of date by the time the checkout event is processed. If two users try to buy the same item at nearly the same time, they will both succeed, and we won’t have enough inventory for them both.</p>
<p>Event-sourced architectures like these suffer many such isolation anomalies, which constantly gaslight users with “time travel” behavior that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unread+notification+glitch">we’re all familiar with</a>. Even worse, research shows that anomaly-permitting architectures create outright security holes that allow hackers to steal data, as covered in <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/acid-rain/">this excellent blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/acidrain-sigmod2017.pdf">this research paper.</a></p>

<p>These problems can be avoided if you use Kafka as a <em>complement</em> to a traditional database:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" alt="kafka used for Change Data Capture from an OLTP database" width="960" height="658" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w"></p>
<p>OLTP databases perform a crucial task that message brokers are not well suited to provide: admission control of events. Rather than using a message broker as a receptacle for “fire and forget” events, forcing your event schema into an “intent pattern”, an OLTP database can <em>deny</em> events that conflict, ensuring that only a single consistent stream of events are ever emitted. OLTP databases are really good at this core <strong>concurrency control</strong> task – scaling to many millions of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Using a database as the point-of-entry for writes, the best way to extract events from a database is via streaming <strong>change-data-capture</strong>. There are several great open CDC frameworks like <a href="http://debezium.io/">Debezium</a> and <a href="http://maxwells-daemon.io/">Maxwell</a>, as well as native CDC from <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/change-data-capture.html">modern</a> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28313/cdc.htm">SQL</a> <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/architecture/docdb-replication/change-data-capture/">databases</a>. Change-data-capture also sets up an elegant operational story. In recovery scenarios, everything can be purged downstream and rebuilt from the (very durable) OLTP database.</p>

<p>The database community has learned (and re-learned) several important lessons over decades. Each one of these lessons was obtained at the high prices of data corruption, data loss, and numerous user-facing anomalies. The last thing you want to do is to find yourself relearning these lessons because you <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491944608/video244677.html">accidentally misbuilt a database</a>.</p>
<p>Real-time streaming message brokers are a great tool for managing high-velocity data. But you will still need a traditional DBMS for isolating transactions. The best reference architecture for “turning your database inside out” is to use OLTP databases for admission control, use CDC for event generation, and model downstream copies of the data as materialized views.</p>

    <h2>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Ard<br>}</h2><br>
  <h2>Little Tasks, Little Trust</h2>
  <h3>How Delegating Responsibilities is Better Than Managing By Tasks</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Trust is the highest form of motivation. It brings out the very
    best in people.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    --Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It’s basically a sacred project management mantra by
now: <strong>divide your work into tasks that are as small as
possible</strong>. Estimate them with your team. Then drop them into
the all-knowing product backlog. But no one seems to be looking very
critically at how this practice has affected the software engineering
profession. Back in the 90’s, when I started programming, this was not
how it worked. It was, dare I say, a little more
professional.</p><p>Back then, your boss had a dozen or more things
they were responsible for and when you got hired they breathed a deep
sigh of relief.</p><p>“Finally, now that Vincent is here, I can make
him do A and B; and with Ted doing C, D, and E and Jan doing F, G, and
H, I can finally get to I, J, K, L, and M.”</p><p>Most importantly, A
and B were big things, like whole products or large system
libraries. Building and maintaining them consumed all of your
time. They were your delegated responsibilities, not mere tasks. It
wasn’t that hard to manage people this way either. If you weren’t
doing a good job, the boss would let you know.</p><p>“Hey, Vincent, A
isn’t turning out quite like I was imagining. Can you do a little more
of this — and definitely more cowbell.”</p><p>Then you went back to
your private office (I sure miss private offices, but that is a topic
for another day) and fixed a few things. Later, in a weekly status
meeting you would tell people how it went — yep, that’s right, no
daily stand-ups where you look mournfully at your shoes and admit that
you didn’t make any notable progress yet.</p><p>No backlog grooming
meetings or burn-down charts either. Your manager simply looked at
how <em>your </em>products were coming along. A little trust, some
accountability, and a healthy portion of “give me some space to do my
work.”</p><p>The way we work now is different. Sadly, it’s less
motivating, less efficient, and profoundly less respectful of
individual abilities.</p><h3>whose vision is it again?</h3><p>As I
see it, little tasks are born of a fundamentally different management
attitude. Small tasks are a not-so-subtle way of saying that all the
product vision lies with management. Keep away. Don’t
touch.</p><p>While larger tasks send a completely different
message. Here, management is giving you bigger pieces to chew on,
inviting you to mix some of your own creativity with the end
product. You get to do some design work, think about what the customer
needs, and take pride in what comes out the other end. Sure, the
organization has an overarching strategy, but they still want people
to take on responsibilities, not just errands. They trust you to align
with the overall vision and because you feel like you are part of the
“club”, you actually want to.</p><h3>too much love for the
metrics</h3><p>Small tasks have also taken hold because they fit
nicely with the age-old assembly-line mentality. Sadly, there are
armies of managers that still live by that dogma. For them, it is all
about picking <em>metrics and optimizing them </em>— management by
chart and graph.</p><p>Unfortunately, little tasks in Jira (or any of
the dozens of other issue tracking systems out there) bring the
promise of a whole host of tasty new charts and graphs: burn-down,
burn-up, velocity, lead-time, cycle time, task age, throughput, failed
deployment, flow and control. It’s as irresistible as candy to a
baby.</p><p>But, assigning responsibilities instead of tasks takes
away an assembly-line manager’s favorite tools. Because they are
larger, responsibilities can’t be so easily measured and tracked. So
metrics-managers will fight both tooth and nail to keep your work divided
and cataloged in tiny, traceable instructions.</p><h3>when will I get some design
experience?</h3><p>Sadly, as developers, we do it to ourselves as
well. Once someone gives us a better title, we are right on board with
the program. When a regular developer might have had a chance to do
some research or design, we immediately snatch it away for
ourselves.</p><p>As technical management, we standardize our
frameworks, languages, deployment operating systems, and cloud service
providers. We write wrappers around networking, logging, and
monitoring libraries and demand they always be used. Then, after we
have taken the task of designing and researching the CI/CD tools and
pipeline, we write coding standards for our coding
standards.</p><p>Worse yet, we design every product’s architecture,
and expect any deviation to be approved by us first. All that is left
are tiny morsels. Grunt work for the foot soldiers once the fun has
been stripped away.</p><p>Poor front-line programmers are left
wide-eyed with empty bowls, asking “please sir, can I have some more?
I just wanted to design one little service. I know I am not worthy,
but can I please just write my own sql queries without using that
awful ORM?  PLEASE?”</p><p>Sadly, when those poor programmers finally
seek promotion, hoping for their first real shot at higher level
engagement, they are rebuffed: “You don’t really have any design
experience I am afraid. We are looking for someone who has designed
large systems.”</p><p>To their managers they could rightfully reply,
“that was your doing, not mine!”</p><h3>estimation is never
free</h3><p>There is a grave misconception circulating that if you
just sit down, in a comfy conference room chair, and split a project
into tiny tasks, small enough to be individually estimated,
then when you add them up, Viola! You’ll have a accurate
estimate for the whole project! Easy peasy.</p><p>There are two
problems with this delusion. First, no task, even a small one,
is easy to estimate. I have seen many “tiny”, one-day tasks blow up
into week long campaigns. All because of hidden complexity that comes
popping out like a Pandora’s box once you start coding on
it.</p><p>Second, when you divide work into little tasks, before
actually working on any of them, you are making untested
assumptions. Many of them. The more tasks you define, the more facets
of a hypothetical design you must assume (implicitly of course, since
no one ever writes design assumptions in task descriptions). Soon,
you’ve created a long chain of design choices, all depending on
previous ones, sitting on sticky notes on the wall.</p><p>The problem
is, as soon as you start working on one of them, you will
realize that your implicit design decisions are wrong. Now, you will spend MUCH more time than was
previously estimated for this task and all other tasks that depend on
its faulty design are invalid. The whole house of cards comes
tumbling down. Time for another all-day backlog grooming session? What
a waste!</p><h3>conclusion</h3><p>Back in the day, before everyone
realized that software companies were positioned to make lots of
money, we had some elbow room. We had a lot of responsibility and the
ability to make a lot of decisions. But now, a lot more people have
piled onto the island. Unfortunately, some of them have slowly chipped
away at the domain of the software engineer. One by one, descending
from their vessels they planted their flags:</p><p>“I am Amerigo, the
product guy. Heretofore, no developer will make product decisions, for
they are mine.”</p><p>“And I am Ferdinand, process guy. Heretofore,
no developer will make process decisions, for they are
mine.”</p><p>“I Bartolomeu will enforce compliance.”</p><p>“I Vasco
used to be pretty good at Microsoft Access, I guess I’ll be the
database guy.”</p><p>One by one, until every responsibility that
wasn’t actual open-up-emacs-and-start-typing-stuff programming was
taken away, forbidden even. And then, the remaining, purely technical
tasks were carved up by architecture/standard hoarding engineers,
hungry for something of substance. Only dry, broken carcasses were
left scattered on the ground.</p><p>Of course, there is a solution to
this predicament — delegate <em>responsibilities</em> to everyone,
all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy. Or better yet,
flatten or abolish the hierarchy all together. But until that
happens, you’ll just have to content yourself with measly for-loops
and if-statements — following the coding standard of
course.</p></div></div>]]>

December 8, 2020 | https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/this-is-going-to-ruin-us-fedex-and-ups-hit-companies-with-unexpected-holiday-shipping-limits/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/this-is-going-to-ruin-us-fedex-and-ups-hit-companies-with-unexpected-holiday-shipping-limits/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Johnny Galbraith, co-founder of Salt Lake City-based e-commerce company Letterfolk, knew that it was going to be difficult to get orders to customers in a timely manner this holiday season, with more people ordering online than ever before.</p><p>He thought he had come up with a solution: to hold his Black Friday sale a week earlier this year. That way, he would be shipping out his products before carriers like FedEx — which he estimates ships 75% of Letterfolk’s packages — would be under the most strain.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>But on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, Galbraith got a call from his FedEx representative: through the holidays, FedEx would only pick up 110 Letterfolk packages per day — something that has never happened to Galbraith in the five years he’s been in business. It was a number that was calculated based on the average number of packages FedEx was picking up from Letterfolk per day in September, plus 10%. But thanks to his early Black Friday sale, Galbraith had a queue of 3,000 orders waiting to go out.</p>

<p>“It was like, ‘this is going to ruin us as a business,'” said Galbraith, whose company sells letterboards and other home decor. “We are being told that just to ship out our existing queue — without any other orders coming it — it would take us up until the holidays to get them out to customers.”</p>
<p>Carriers like FedEx and UPS have been warning for months to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-holiday-crunch-starts-early-with-more-packages-than-means-to-deliver-them-11603013401">expect holiday shipping delays</a>. But some retail executives, like Galbraith, say they were not given advanced notice by carriers that they could face package pickup limits this holiday. It’s an issue that’s affecting companies both big and small — the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-slaps-shipping-limits-on-gap-nike-to-manage-e-commerce-surge-11606926669">reported</a> last week that UPS had temporarily stopped accepting shipments from major retailers like Nike and Macy’s.</p>
<p>Some executives who spoke with Modern Retail said that they feel like their carriers did not give them enough advance notice before applying a limit, and are frustrated by the fact that limits seem to be arbitrarily applied. In the meantime, they’re scrambling to find often expensive alternatives, including renting their own trucks or trying to find space with other carriers.</p>
<p>Representatives from FedEx and UPS would not provide details to Modern Retail about how they calculate package pickup limits.</p>
<p>FedEx has been “proactively working with our customers to understand their expected volume,” a spokeswoman told Modern Retail, and said the company has been preparing for the holidays by hiring more than 70,000 seasonal workers this year, and for the first time, picking up packages seven days a week.</p>

<p>“<span>UPS</span>&nbsp;continues to work closely with our largest customers to steer volume to capacity and ensure the&nbsp;<span>UPS</span> network is reliable for all customers,” a UPS spokesman said. “Agreed upon strategies for our largest customers include shifting package volume away from the heaviest demand shipping days, fully utilizing weekend capacity, and aligning promotional strategies with capacity.”</p>
<p><strong>Making their own deliveries<br>
</strong>For the most part, UPS and FedEx first started imposing shipping limits after Black Friday. Helena Price Hambrecht, founder of aperitif brand Haus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/business/ecommerce-shipping-holiday-season.html?referringSource=articleShare">told the New York Times</a> that FedEx informed her that starting on Wednesday, its drivers would only pick up 500 packages from Haus per week day, through the holidays. FedEx however, did give Haus a larger cap on the weekends. In a follow-up email to Modern Retail, Price Hambrecht did not say exactly when FedEx informed her of the limit, only that “FedEx has been great about communicating changes to us as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>David Malka, chief sales officer of returns processing company goTRG — which works with major retailers like Target, Walmart and Lowe’s to process some of their returns — told Modern Retail that shipping limits of roughly 200 packages per day had been imposed at four of the company’s warehouses. Though he added that the company is getting “conflicting reports” from FedEx about what exactly the limit is at some facilities. Malka, like Gilbraith said that goTRG received no advanced notice from FedEx that package pickup limits would be applied.</p>
<p>The most immediate way that retailers are trying to deal with pickup limits imposed by UPS or FedEx is to redirect some shipments to another carrier. Shortly after Galbraith’s FedEx representative informed him of Letterfolk’s new limit, he immediately set up deliveries through UPS — something he said he hadn’t done previously because he had a good relationship with FedEx.</p>
<p>That’s helped Letterfolk get through some of the 3,000 order backlog, though its <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/pages/holiday-shipping-info">website is still advising customer</a>s that most orders placed during its Black Friday sale will ship within one to three business weeks. However, he said that it’s more expensive right now for Letterfolk to ship through UPS, because his company didn’t have time to negotiate discounted rates.</p>
<p>Some companies are setting up other contingency plans to ensure their packages get into customers hands more quickly. Price Hambrecht told Modern Retail that Haus will be relying on Ohi, a last-mile delivery provider, to deliver more of its packages in the Bay Area and Southern California.</p>
<p>Jay Sauceda, founder of Austin-based 3PL Sauceda Industries, said that his company rented its own truck for the first time for the holidays. Sauceda — which works with companies including apparel brand Rowing Blazers and bra startup Pepper — has yet to be hit with a package pickup per day limit. But if it does, the plan then is to load packages onto the truck and deliver them directly to a FedEx or UPS sorting facility.</p>
<p>Sauceda is also advising its customers to try and encourage customers to get orders in two to three days ahead of shipping cutoffs given by FedEx, UPS and other carriers to ensure packages arrive in time for Christmas and other key dates.</p>
<p>“[The carriers] are in a very unenviable position,” Sauceda said. “So the biggest thing that we are trying to do this year to try to take the tension off.”</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that FedEx has capped the number of Haus packages it will pick up at 500 per week day, not per day as previously stated.&nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>
                                Tuesday December 08, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/lars-knoll">Lars Knoll</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>I am really excited to announce today’s release of Qt 6.0. It is the first release of a new major version, and marks a major milestone for Qt. </span><strong><em>We started working on the initial ideas a few years ago, and since then, have put a massive effort into creating the next generation of Qt. </em></strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20email%20launch%20hero%201-png-1.png" alt="Qt 6"></span></a></p>

<p><span>Qt 5 has been a fantastic success over the years, and we have seen an enormous growth of our user base and Qt usage over eight years since we released Qt 5.0. But the world&nbsp; has undergone significant changes since 2012. Qt usage in embedded systems has skyrocketed, C++ has evolved, and new 3D graphics APIs have emerged. These are examples of factors that have directly affected Qt.</span></p>
<p><span>As a cross-platform framework, Qt needs to adjust to those changing requirements. We have managed to adapt very well to many of those requirements during the lifetime of Qt 5. However, maintaining full source and binary compatibility within the Qt 5 series made certain things impossible to fix within its lifetime. With Qt 6, we now have the opportunity to make changes and build Qt to be better suited for the years to come.</span><span></span></p>
<div>
<p>Thus, the mission of Qt 6 is to enable Qt to be the productivity platform for the future. Qt 6.0, as a major release of Qt, gave us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality, and better support today and tomorrow's requirements. Qt 6.0 is a continuation of the Qt 5 series, and we have focused on making migration non-disruptive for users. I published a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener">Qt 6 vision blog post</a> capturing those ideas around 18 months ago.</p>
<p>When creating Qt 6, we ensured that Qt’s core values have been adhered to and upheld, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its cross-platform nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single codebase</li>
<li>Its scalability from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li>Its world-class APIs and tools and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/" rel="noopener">documentation</a>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li>Its maintainability, stability, and compatibility, allowing users to maintain large codebases with minimal effort</li>
<li>Its large developer ecosystem with more than 1.5 million users</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt 6.0 is the first release of the Qt 6 series addressing new market demands while keeping the core values at the heart of what we do.</p>
<p>When developing Qt 6, we had an in-depth look at some of Qt's most central parts to identify how we could improve them. We discovered a couple of core focus areas that we invested considerable time in improving. Those areas include:</p>
<div>
<ul>

<p>We have of course also spent time doing numerous improvements in other areas, too many to mention them all here, and I suggest you look at the more detailed <span><span><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_6.0" rel="noopener">wiki page</a>. We are also hosting Meet Qt 6.0 webinar sessions covering the <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607340244" rel="noopener">Americas/EMEIA</a> and <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607339968" rel="noopener">EMEIA/APAC</a> time zones. But let's take a look at some of the highlights.</span></span></p>
</div>
<h3><span>C++17</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png" width="168" alt="C++ 17 in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=84&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 84w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 168w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=252&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 252w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=336&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 336w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=420&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 420w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=504&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 504w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px"></span></p>
<p><span>With Qt 6 we now require a C++17 compatible compiler enabling the use more modern C++ language constructs when developing Qt and also allows for integration points on the API side.</span></p>
<h3><span>Core libraries and APIs</span></h3>
<p><span>Much work has gone into Qt Core, as it is the module that implements the most central parts of Qt. We've gone through many areas there and made improvements. To name some of the most central ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The new <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/property-bindings-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">property and binding system</a>: This system now brings the concept of bindings that made QML such a huge success in Qt 5 available from C++. </span></li>
<li><span>Strings and Unicode: With Qt 5, we started aligning Qt fully with Unicode, where we completed a lot of the work, but a few items remained that we now cleaned up for Qt 6. More details will come in a separate blog post later on.</span></li>
<li><span>QList has been a class that was often criticized in Qt 5, as it was heap allocating objects stored in there that were larger than a pointer, leading to pressure on heap allocation methods. In Qt 6, we changed this and unified QList and QVector into one class. See our <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qlist-changes-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post about QList</a> in Qt 6 for details.</span></li>
<li><span>QMetaType and QVariant are fundamental to how our Qt’s meta-object system works. Signals and slots would not be possible without QMetaType and QVariant is required for dynamic invocations. Those two classes got an almost complete rewrite with Qt 6, and you can read about the details <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/whats-new-in-qmetatype-qvariant" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other parts of Qt that are not related to graphics have also seen large changes. For example, Qt Concurrent has undergone an almost complete rewrite and now makes development of multi-threaded applications more effortless than ever. Qt Network has seen lots of clean-up and improvements. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-network-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post</a> for details.</span></p>
<h3><span>New graphics architecture</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></h3>
<p><span>The graphics architecture of Qt 5 was very much dependent on OpenGL as the underlying 3D graphics API. While this was the right approach in 2012 when we created Qt 5, the market around us has changed significantly over the last couple of years with the introduction of Metal and Vulkan. We now have a large set of different graphics APIs that are commonly being used on different platforms. For Qt as a cross-platform framework, this, of course, meant that we had to adjust to this and ensure our users can run Qt on all of them with </span>maximum performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png" width="367" alt="New graphics architecture in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=184&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 184w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 367w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=551&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 551w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=734&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 734w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=918&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 918w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=1101&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 1101w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px"></p>
<p><span>So while Qt 5 relied on OpenGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, the picture completely changes with Qt 6. All of our 3D graphics in Qt Quick is now built on top of a new abstraction layer for 3D graphics called RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface). RHI makes it possible for Qt to use the native 3D graphics API of the underlying OS/platform. So Qt Quick will now use Direct3D on Windows and Metal on macOS by default. For details, have a look at the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/graphics-in-qt-6.0-qrhi-qt-quick-qt-quick-3d" rel="noopener">blog post series about the RHI</a>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OpenGL specific classes in Qt still exist, but are now moved out of QtGui in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-index.html" rel="noopener">QtOpenGL</a> module. We also added a new module called <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtshadertools-index.html" rel="noopener">QtShaderTools</a> to deal with the different shading languages of those APIs in a cross-platform way.</span></p>
<h3><span>Qt Quick 3D and Qt 3D</span></h3>
<p><span>Qt Quick 3D is a relatively new module. It seamlessly extends Qt Quick with 3D capabilities. With Qt Quick 3D, our focus was to create an API that is as easy to use as the existing parts of Qt Quick (for 2D user interfaces) while providing full support for creating complex 3D scenes. The main goal behind this effort has been to enable seamless integration between 2D and 3D content.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This module has seen significant improvements with Qt 6 that we wouldn’t have been able to do in the Qt 5 series. Most importantly it is now always using the RHI abstraction layer to make optimal use of the underlying graphics API and Hardware. Additionally, it now features a much deeper and more performant integration between 2D and 3D content, allowing you to place 2D items into a 3D scene. It also has vastly improved support for glTF2 and physics-based rendering, making it trivial to import assets created in other design tools. There are many other major improvements in the module, a more in-depth description can be found in a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/what-is-new-in-qt-quick-3d-6.0" rel="noopener">separate blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 3D is now also based on top of the RHI abstraction layer, has seen some performance improvements and cleanups. You can find more details in two blog posts by our partner KDAB (<a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt-3d-changes-in-qt-6/" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt3d-renderer-qt6/" rel="noopener">here</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span>Desktop styling for Qt Quick</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20Desktop%20Styling-png.png" alt="Desktop Styling in Qt 6"></span></p>
<p><span>When we created the set of controls for Qt Quick, our focus was to make them lightweight and performant. For that reason, they did not support desktop styling in Qt 5. However, in Qt 6, we found a way to make them look &amp; feel native on desktop operating systems. With 6.0, Qt Quick now supports native styling on both macOS and Windows. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls" rel="noopener">blog post for details</a>.</span><span> Native look &amp; feel for Android and Linux already existed with the Material and Fusion styles in Qt 5. We are improving those for future Qt releases and are also planning to implement a native style for iOS.</span></p>
<h3><span>Interfacing with platform specific functionality</span></h3>
<p><span>Even with Qt offering most functionality required to develop your application platform-independently, there is sometimes a need to interface with platform-specific functionality. In Qt 5, we provided a set of add-on modules (QtX11Extras, QtWinExtras, QtMacExtras) to help with this purpose. But this full separation from the rest of Qt has led to a couple of architectural issues, inconsistencies and code duplication within Qt. In Qt 6, we made an effort to clean this up and fold the functionality offered by those add-on modules into platform specific APIs offered directly in Qt. This will make interfacing with OS/platform-specific APIs much easier in Qt 6. Have a look <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/platform-apis-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;for more details.</span></p>
<h3><span>Build system and&nbsp;</span><span>Packaging</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png" width="189" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=95&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 95w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 189w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=284&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 284w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=378&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 378w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=473&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 473w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=567&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 567w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></span></p>
<p><span>We also made some considerable changes in how we build and distribute Qt.&nbsp; Worth mentioning is that Qt 6 itself is now <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system" rel="noopener">built using CMake</a>. This has also led to significant improvements for all our users that use CMake to build their projects. We will continue to support qmake for the lifetime of Qt 6, so there is no need to make any changes to your build system if you're using it, but we recommend to use CMake for all new projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6 also comes with a much smaller default package, and many of the add-ons are now distributed as separate packages through a package manager. This gives us more flexibility in adapting release schedules of add-ons to market requirements, allowing, for example, for more frequent feature releases as the core Qt packages or making them available for multiple Qt versions at the same time. In addition, we can use the package manager as a delivery channel for 3rd party content. And finally, it gives our users more flexibility as they can choose to download only what they really need. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, we are using the existing Qt …</span></p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>â€˜Darkâ€™ personalities come in</strong> various shades, but at the core of all of them is a tendency to callously use others for personal gain. What is it that these types of people are really gaining, though? Might a benevolent approach to life and others be even more advantageous?</p>
<p>For <span>15 years,</span> research into dark personality traits (including narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) has been rapidly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">expanding</a>. We now know that these traits are far more <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32484407" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evident</a>, on average, in men than women. We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">approximately</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-13625-018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span>1-2 per cent</span></a> of individuals in the general population display extremely dark personality features â€“ enough to meet the clinical threshold for a personality disorder â€“ and about <span>10-20 per</span> cent of individuals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22996170/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">have</a> moderately elevated levels. We know that even people with moderate levels of dark traits can wreak havoc: they are more likely to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616666070" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">lie and cheat</a>, show <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305468" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">racist</a> attitudes, and be <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-04417-005" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent</a> towards others.</p>
<p>As researchers, we have studied these traits ourselves. But in a bid to balance out the extensive literature on dark traits, we have recently started to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">focus</a> on the light side of human personality instead â€“ the â€˜everyday saintsâ€™ among us. These people are genuinely interested in others and treat them well without question, not as a means to an end. They applaud the success of others, believe in the fundamental goodness of humans, and respect the dignity of everyone. Our recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692030310X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 36,000 adults suggests that these traits are common: around <span>30-50 per cent</span> of people show prominent light personality trait profiles, depending on world region, and these traits are particularly common in women.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand which personality profile â€“ dark or light â€“ leads to more success and happiness in the long run. There is an oft-touted saying that â€˜Nice guys finish lastâ€™ and, on the face of it, this might seem correct. If youâ€™re always expending your energy caring about others, perhaps youâ€™re bound to get left behind. If youâ€™re willing to deceive and exploit others without worrying about their feelings, you can look after â€˜number oneâ€™ and rise faster to the top. But does the research back this up?</p>
<p>Experimental studies support the idea of a â€˜successfulâ€™ dark personality, but only up to a point. One <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-11168-026" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that people with psychopathic personality traits win more points on a negotiation task where they are required to compete with a partner, but fewer points on a task that involves cooperation. Those with dark traits are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-018-9823-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">more</a> likely to â€˜defectâ€™ in the classic Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma task â€“ an approach that means maximising your own outcome while duping the other participant.</p>
<p>But their success in the real world is questionable. In corporate settings, those with dark personality traits are slightly more likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51219-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emerge</a> as leaders and are seen as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.925" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">charismatic</a> but, when it comes to getting the job done, they tend to achieve less and are considered poor team players. Our recent study also found that political figures with dark personality traits are more likely to get elected and hold their positions, but other studies <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615611922" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">show</a> that they are much poorer at getting legislation passed. Hedge fund managers with these traits generally <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217733080" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">obtain</a> significantly lower financial returns on the investment funds they manage. Overall, individuals with dark traits <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0025679" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">engage</a> in more counterproductive work behaviour, such as theft and abusive supervision. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they donâ€™t end up with higher average incomes than their peers with light personalities.</p>
<p>Through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on</p>
<p>On top of this, those with dark personality traits donâ€™t have much luck outside of work. Even if they manage to avoid prison (imprisonment being a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18837606/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">high</a> possibility for those with extreme traits), they are at increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suicide</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556964/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent death</a>. They are also not particularly happy: people with dark traits tend to report poor self-image, an inability to intimately connect with others, and little life satisfaction. In contrast, we found that those with light personality trait profiles have fulfilling, intrinsically rewarding lives: they generally have a more positive view of themselves, more positive connections with others and find life more satisfying.</p>
<p>The key factor here seems to be empathy: the capacity to resonate with â€“ and understand the perspective of â€“ the emotional experiences of others. Individuals with light personality traits show a great deal of empathy for others, while those with dark personality traits tend to show very little. In our new research, we found that this seems to be what leads to a more satisfying life. Similarly, being prosocial â€“ acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others â€“ is also significantly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-65092-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> with higher wellbeing.</p>
<p>As a species, weâ€™re fundamentally built for social connectedness, and we depend on cooperation and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.14.3.137" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">trust</a>. When those with dark personalities try to take advantage of this for their own personal gain, they do so at their own peril. In essence, through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on. While those with dark traits might initially capture the attention of others, their social behaviour ultimately leads to limited success in work or politics, and little satisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>So far, we have</strong> made it seem as though people fall into one of two binary groups: dark or light. But in reality, thereâ€™s a third group: we found that about <span>40 per cent</span> of individuals show a balance of dark and light traits. People in this mixed group are similar to the light group when it comes to critical variables involving empathy and social connectedness, but they still show some dark tendencies â€“ hampering their relationships to some degree with deceitful, self-absorbed or hurtful behaviour toward others.</p>
<p>Some might think that the mixed group is the optimal place to be: youâ€™re able to have some connection with others, but wonâ€™t be taken as a pushover. But compared with those with a light personality, mixed individuals have lower levels of life satisfaction and a less positive self-image. It seems that the mixed group are on the way to the light personality profile, so to speak, but fall short of the full expression â€“ and the added dark traits are whatâ€™s holding them back.</p>
<p>As people age â€“ particularly from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles</p>
<p>Regardless of where you fall on these dimensions of personality, we <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">believe</a> in the fundamental ability to grow and change. Large-scale studies have <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0024950" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">documented</a> that your general personality (eg, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness) continues to change throughout your lifetime, and weâ€™ve found the same to be true when it comes to light and dark traits.</p>
<p>Specifically, we found that the extent to which you exhibit light or dark personality traits tends to shift as you get older. As people age â€“ particularly as they progress from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles. Other <a href="https://content.apa.org/record/2014-34008-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that moral character traits, such as conscientiousness and self-control, are generally more common in older people. Age doesnâ€™t completely account for the results â€“ younger people can display light personality traits â€“ but the research suggests that what can fundamentally differentiate light and dark profiles is a process of psychological maturation.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417734875" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">born</a> with an innate sense of fairness, though this is a limited ability. Thus, like language, it is a skill that requires further development. Our research, and studies of our closest relatives, nonhuman primates, both show that moral behaviour can emerge and change across development â€“ in large part through cooperative social interactions. Thus, by embracing and trusting social connections, we can progress toward a light personality trait profile â€“ a pathway that appears to lead to healthy self-actualisation and even transcendence.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re curious about where you fall on the light vs dark personality spectrum, you can answer the <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">questions</a> we used in our study. We have now tested more than 250,000 individuals from across the globe, and you can see how your responses compare with the average. And remember, there is always scope for change: we believe in the fundamental ability to grow and transcend self-centredness through deliberate and sustained changes in our patterns of behaviour and thinking.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to <em>want</em> to change. Unfortunately, most people with extreme levels of dark personality traits donâ€™t want to change who they are. Despite not being particularly happy with their lives, they remain fixated on what they think they need: more and more power, wealth and domination over others.</p>
<p>Of course, some days weâ€™re all motivated to shut out other people, and simply look out for ourselves. This can be especially true when it seems that those who cheat, deceive and take advantage of others are somehow getting ahead. But rest assured that this doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. We have found that being empathic and connected to others â€“ capitalising on our fundamentally social nature â€“ is ultimately the pathway to a more rewarding life.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
