<p>
	
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">OpenCelliD</a> is the world's largest 
	open database of cell towers with a license
	<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>
</p>

<p>
	Data has full world coverage and freely available for
	<a href="https://www.opencellid.org/">download.</a>
</p>

<p>
	This tabular data[1] has ~40 million rows and 6 columns in it but only 3
	columns (latitude, longitude, and type) are used in this visualization.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/csv.png" alt="">
</a>

<em>[1] Structure of input data.</em></p><p>
	Above table data is read line by line and grouped by their location info.
	Grouping is done as if they were <a href="https://developers.planet.com/planetschool/xyz-tiles-and-slippy-maps/">XYZ Tiles.</a></p>


<p>
	First, empty 2d integer arrays for each tile are created and its elements are 
	initialized with value = 0. 
	Those values hold a counter that shows the number of rows that 
	geographically contained in that pixel.
	Every row increases the relevant counter by one[2]. 
	After iterating all rows with this method, we end up with a bunch of
	integer values (in different 2d arrays) that represent row counts per region.
</p>

<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step2.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[2] Each row increases relevant counter.</em></p><p>
	In order to achieve city-level resolution for visualization, tiles up to
	zoom level 9 should be generated. 
	<a href="https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/">
	For XYZ tiles, the number of tiles per zoom level is 4^zoom.</a>
	Therefore, for zoom levels between 0 to 9, the number of tiles that should be generated 
	becomes 4^0 + 4^1 + 4^2 + .. + 4^9 which equals to 349525.
	Every tile has 256x256 integer values.
	Even with using 32 bit-sized integer values, 
	one tile occupies 256 * 256 * 32 bit = 256 kilobytes of storage,
	and <b>349525 tiles</b> occupies <b>87 gigabytes of storage</b> which is 
	definitely not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	To solve this size problem every tile blob is compressed independently
	with a modern compression algorithm 
	<a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">brotli</a>.
	Despite being slow to encode, brotli has a fast decoding speed and high compression ratio
	compared to older compression methods like gzip. Additionally, 
	brotli-compressed-data is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=brotli">
	natively decodable with all modern browsers</a>.
	Since there are no cell towers in oceans or uninhabitable areas, tiles for those regions 
	are full of zero values or very sparse. Due to this high redundancy,
	compression performed extremely well for those regions (256kb compressed to 20~100bytes).
</p>

<p>
    In order to simplify the algorithm, it is described as if there was only one 
    counter value in each pixel, but there are 4 counter values per pixel each
    holding number of row counts for different cell tower types[3]
</p>


<p><a href="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png" target="_blank">
	<img src="https://alpercinar.com/open-cell-id/step3.png" alt="">
</a>
<em>[3] Every pixel stores more than one channels (counter)</em></p><p>
    Even though these tiles are stored like XYZ tiles, they are not 
    valid XYZ tiles.Since these blobs are just brotli-compressed-integer-arrays.
    Visualization requires a blob to image conversion. This conversion is
    done by client side javascript and HTML5 Canvas API.
</p>

<p>
    Underlying map displaying library in this visualization is
    <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">leaflet</a>.
    Kudos to leaflet author(s) for writing such a well documented and extendable
    map library, I was able to write a custom tile layer for leaflet that 
    intercepts the image tile requests made by leaflet and redirects those
    image tile requests to an image generating (client-side) web worker that 
    works like a tile server. Web worker follows a simple algorithm for image generation.

    It reads the row count values pixel by pixel and generates a color for that
    pixel (higher the row count lighter and more opaque the pixel color).
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, this was a fun project for me to work on and I learned a lot 
    about data compression and multi-threading while working on this. 
    By off-loading compute-intensive tasks to web-workers, very impressive visualizations
    can be made even without sacrificing a single FPS drop on UI thread.

<![CDATA[Passwordless Logins with Yubikey]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 87 | Comments 60 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26169369">thread link</a>) | @adl1995
<br/>
February 17, 2021 | https://adl1995.github.io/passwordless-logins-with-yubikey.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adl1995.github.io/passwordless-logins-with-yubikey.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yubikey is currently the de facto device for <span>U2F</span> authentication. It enables adding an extra layer of security on top of <span>SSH</span>, system login, signing <span>GPG</span> keys, and so on. It is also compatible with several other authentication methods, such as WebAuthn and <span>PAM</span>.</p>
<p>This post will show how to leverage your Yubikey for unlocking the system lock-screen, both with and without using a password. It will then delve into how to automatically lock the screen when the Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged.</p>
<p>To achieve logins with Yubikeys we require a <span>PAM</span> configuration. <span>PAM</span> or Pluggable Authentication Modules define the authentication flow for common Linux utilities, such as <code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, and <code>passwd</code>. We will override the default authentication flow for the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xlock">xlock</a> lock manager to allow logins with&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The above process should be similar across most lock managers, such as <code>i3lock</code> or <code>xscreensaver</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Creating a <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;configuration</h2>
<p>We shall first replicate the default authentication provided with xlock using <span>PAM</span>. With this configuration the user should only be able to log in with their&nbsp;password.</p>
<p>All <span>PAM</span> configuration files lie under the <code>/etc/pam.d/</code> directory. We create a file named <code>xlock</code> which replicates the default&nbsp;authentication:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/pam.d/xlock
<span>#%PAM-1.0</span>
auth            include         system-auth
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For the above configuration file to take effect the tool (<code>xlock</code>) must be <span>PAM</span> compatible. We can confirm that <code>xlock</code> is <span>PAM</span> compatible by inspecting the output of <code>ldd /usr/bin/xlock | grep libpam.so</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first comment line indicates the <span>PAM</span> version. The lines that follow define the authentication&nbsp;flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>auth</code> is the module interface responsible for verifying the user’s&nbsp;password.</li>
<li><code>include</code> is the <span>PAM</span> control flag which <em>includes</em> the <code>system-auth</code> configuration file (this file defines the default authentication flow). This flag can also be used to load modules, as we shall see&nbsp;later.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There is an excellent <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/managing_smart_cards/pam_configuration_files">documentation</a> provided by RedHat on <span>PAM</span> configuration&nbsp;files.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Supporting Yubikey&nbsp;logins</h3>
<p>We shall now add Yubikey login functionality to our <span>PAM</span> configuration, but we first need to install the Yubico module for <span>PAM</span> and set it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Yubico, the company behind Yubikeys, exposes the <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/">pam_yubico.so</a> module which can be used for Yubikey&nbsp;authentication.</p>
<p>It provides two authentication mechanisms, the <code>client</code> mode and the <code>challenge-response</code> mode. The <code>client</code> mode sends a request to the Yubico server for verifying the user’s <span>OTP</span>, and requires an active Internet connection for the user to login. As this is inconvenient we shall only explore the <code>challenge-response</code> mode in this&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the configuration the <code>pam_yubico</code> package must be installed manually. This package is easily available across most Linux distributions. On Arch Linux it can be installed&nbsp;with:</p>

<p>We next add Yubikey mappings before setting the challenge-response&nbsp;credential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: It is recommended that you use a secondary account to perform the next steps as there is a risk of permanently locking your account (in case of <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;misconfiguration).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Adding&nbsp;mappings</h4>
<p>Each Yubikey must be paired with a unique public <span>ID</span> which the <code>pam_yubico</code> module uses to uniquely identify the user. The public <span>ID</span> consists of the first 12 characters extracted from the <span>OTP</span>&nbsp;token.</p>
<p>To obtain your Yubikey’s public <span>ID</span> open up your shell and press the Yubikey button. You will see a similar output as&nbsp;below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>vvctffbvkhdnliklfhbbfiecudthfvrvuhnhtirehidr</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now copy take the first 12 characters (<code>vvctffbvkhdn</code>) and add them to a file named <code>yubikey_mappings</code> in the <code>/etc/</code> directory, along with your username. In our case this will&nbsp;be:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/yubikey_mappings
adeel:vvctffbvkhdn
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This file also allows specifying multiple Yubikey mappings, each separated by a new&nbsp;line.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Setting the challenge response&nbsp;credential</h4>
<p>Yubikey needs to somehow verify the generated <span>OTP</span> (One Time Password) when it tries to authenticate the user. It does so by using the <code>challenge-response</code> mode.</p>
<p>To set up the <code>challenge-response</code> mode, we first need to install the Yubikey manager tool called <code>ykman</code>. On Arch Linux it can be installed&nbsp;with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ pacman -S yubikey-manger
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>ykman</code> tool will generate a secret credential and store it in a local file. Whenever the user tries to login with <code>xlock</code>, the <code>pam_yubico</code> module will verify the generated <span>OTP</span> against the stored&nbsp;credential.</p>
<p>The challenge response credential can be set on slot 2 of the Yubikey&nbsp;with:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ykman otp chalresp --generate <span>2</span>
Using a randomly generated key: 29eb38b6f50b246c46f954af9710a77c78792114
Program a challenge-response credential in slot <span>2</span>? <span>[</span>y/N<span>]</span>: y
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Ensure that the slot you’re writing the data to doesn’t already contain any credential, as it might not be&nbsp;recoverable!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the <code>challenge-response</code> credential is set it needs to be written to a local file which will be later read by <code>pam_yubico</code>.</p>
<p>Yubico provides another tool called <code>ykpamcfg</code> (which should be bundled with the <code>yubikey-manger</code> package) to write this file to disk. It takes the Yubikey slot number as its parameter and writes the secret to a&nbsp;file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ykpamcfg -2
Stored initial challenge and expected response in <span>'/home/adeel/.yubico/challenge-&lt;Serial ID&gt;'</span>.
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Updating the Linux <span>PAM</span>&nbsp;configuration</h3>
<p>We shall now update the <code>/etc/pam.d/xlock</code> file and add the Yubico <span>PAM</span> at the very&nbsp;beginning.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/pam.d/xlock
<span>#%PAM-1.0</span>

auth  sufficient  pam_yubico.so debug <span>mode</span><span>=</span>challenge-response <span>authfile</span><span>=</span>/etc/yubikey_mappings
auth  include     system-auth
</code></pre></div>
<p>We pass three parameters to the <code>pam_yubico.so</code> module:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debug</code> prints all the authentication steps to the console when the ‘Enter’ key is&nbsp;pressed.</li>
<li><code>mode</code> specifies which mode the module will use for authentication (<code>challenge-response</code> or <code>client</code>).</li>
<li><code>authfile</code> points to the credential file written by the <code>ykpamcfg</code> tool. </li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the module type to <code>sufficient</code> means that if Yubikey authentication succeeds, no further steps will be processed and the user will get logged in. This is the key point which enables passwordless logins. However, in the event of authentication failure, remaining authentication steps will still be applied, i.e. the user can still log in with their password if the Yubikey is not plugged&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>If the module type is set to <code>required</code> instead of <code>sufficient</code> it will enable Two-Factor Authentication (<span>2FA</span>) which will require the user to plug in their Yubikey <em>and</em> enter their password to&nbsp;login.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For passwordless logins the user will need to press the <code>Enter</code> with their Yubikey plugged in to unlock their&nbsp;screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage you should be able unlock your screen with they&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You may need to replug your Yubikey for the changes to take&nbsp;effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Automatically locking the screen when Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged</h2>
<p>Up till locking the screen still requires manually invoking the <code>xlock</code> command. It would be nice if we can somehow automatically lock the screen whenever our Yubikey is unplugged. We can achieve this with&nbsp;Udev.</p>
<p>Udev is the device manager used in Linux which can be used for a myriad of tasks. It tracks the state changes for all external devices, for example, it can be used to identify when a <span>USB</span> device is plugged or unplugged. Each device outputs a series of attributes which can be used to uniquely identify&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>We shall use these attributes to create a Udev rule which triggers an <code>xlock.service</code> Systemd service when the Yubikey is&nbsp;unplugged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: We can also achieve this with a Shell script instead of Systemd, but Udev discourages executing long-running programs using scripts as it terminates them after a certain time&nbsp;period.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating the Systemd&nbsp;service</h3>
<p>Systemd is the Linux service manager which can be used to launch user processes. We create a file named <code>xlock.service</code> in the <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/systemd/system/xlock.service
<span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>xlock

<span>[</span>Service<span>]</span>
<span>User</span><span>=</span>adeel
<span>Type</span><span>=</span>simple
<span>Environment</span><span>=</span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span>:0
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>/usr/bin/xlock 

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>multi-user.target
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Type=simple</code> implies that this service does not exit after&nbsp;execution.</li>
<li>The <code>Environment</code> tag specifies which display should be locked (<code>0</code> is the default&nbsp;display).</li>
<li>The <code>ExecStart</code> tag takes a path of the binary or script it will&nbsp;execute.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Consult the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">official docs</a> to explore Systemd in&nbsp;detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating the Udev&nbsp;rule</h3>
<p>We first need to identify a set of unique attributes for our device (Yubikey). The <code>udevadm</code> tool allows monitoring Udev output whenever a device state changes. We shall invoke the following command and then remove our&nbsp;Yubikey:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ udevadm monitor --environment --udev 
monitor will print the received events <span>for</span>:
UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing

UDEV  <span>[</span><span>461872</span>.738673<span>]</span> remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-2/1-2.1/1-2.1:1.0/0003:1050:0407.0157/input/input294/event18 <span>(</span>input<span>)</span>
<span>ACTION</span><span>=</span>remove
<span>ID_VENDOR</span><span>=</span>Yubico
<span>SUBSYSTEM</span><span>=</span>input
<span>DEVNAME</span><span>=</span>/dev/input/event18
<span>ID_INPUT_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>
...
</code></pre></div>
<p>We only show a truncated output above, but once you have identified the attributes you would like to use, create a file named <code>yubikey-actions.rules</code> in the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/</code> directory:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey-actions.rules 
<span>ACTION</span><span>==</span><span>"remove"</span>, ENV<span>{</span>ID_MODEL_ID<span>}==</span><span>"0407"</span>, ENV<span>{</span>ID_VENDOR_ID<span>}==</span><span>"1050"</span>, <span>RUN</span><span>+=</span><span>"/usr/bin/systemctl start xlock.service"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It might be worthwhile to reload the configuration for both Systemd and&nbsp;Udev:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ systemctl daemon-reload
$ udevadm control --reload
</code></pre></div>
<p>If everything worked out fine your screen should now get locked whenever you remove your&nbsp;Yubikey.</p>

______________________________________________________________________

RETRO is a clean, elegant, and pragmatic dialect of Forth. It provides
a simple alternative for those willing to make a break from legacy
systems.

The language draws influences from many sources including traditional 
Forth systems, cmForth, colorForth, Factor, and Parable. It was
designed to be easy to grasp and adapt to specific uses.

The basic language is very portable. It runs on a tiny virtual
machine (Nga), which is written in C. There are multiple interface
options, the main one (rre) is buildable with just the standard C
compiler and libraries on most systems.

									<p>The U.K. is set to begin the world’s first trial of healthy volunteers being intentionally infected with coronavirus, after the study received ethics approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The so-called human challenge study will begin within a month, said the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in a statement Wednesday, with up to 90 people being exposed to a very small amount of coronavirus in a safe and controlled environment. These kinds of trials are controversial as they expose healthy volunteers to diseases that may be deadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next stage of the study, which has not yet been approved, will involve giving a coronavirus vaccine to different volunteers and then exposing them to coronavirus. Only vaccines that “have proven to be safe in clinical trials” will be used. However, researchers are still a “long way” from this stage of the study, according to Terence Stephenson, chair of the Health Research Authority, which gave ethics approval.</p>

<p>Proponents say these studies provide the fastest way to evaluate new vaccines, especially when the world emerges from an active pandemic, said Robert Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences within medicine at the University of Southampton, who belongs to this camp and is part of the team involved in the study.</p>
<p>This initial part of the study will help doctors understand how the immune system reacts to the virus and identify what affects transmission. The drug&nbsp;Remdesivir will be used as soon as volunteers start developing symptoms. </p>
<p>The volunteers, who are being encouraged to come forward for the study, will be between 18 and 30 and will be exposed to the variant circulating in the U.K. since March 2020. </p>

<p>The&nbsp;Polyus&nbsp;spacecraft (<a title="Russian language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language">Russian</a>:&nbsp;<span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">Полюс</span>,&nbsp;<a title="Geographical pole" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole">pole</a>), also known as&nbsp;Polus,&nbsp;Skif-DM,&nbsp;<a title="GRAU" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRAU">GRAU</a>&nbsp;index&nbsp;17F19DM, was a prototype<a title="Space weapon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weapon">orbital weapons platform</a>&nbsp;designed to destroy&nbsp;<a title="Strategic Defense Initiative" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative">SDI satellites</a>&nbsp;with a megawatt&nbsp;<a title="Carbon dioxide laser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_laser">carbon-dioxide laser</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-starwars-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It had a Functional Cargo Block derived from a&nbsp;<a title="TKS spacecraft" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKS_spacecraft">TKS spacecraft</a>&nbsp;to control its orbit and it could fire test targets to demonstrate the fire control system.</p>
<p>The Polyus spacecraft was launched 15 May 1987 from&nbsp;<a title="Baikonur Cosmodrome" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>&nbsp;<a title="Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Site_250">Site 250</a>&nbsp;as part of the first flight of the&nbsp;<a title="Energia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia">Energia</a>system,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;but failed to reach orbit.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a title="Yuri Kornilov (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yuri_Kornilov&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Yuri Kornilov</a>, Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus’ launch,&nbsp;<a title="Mikhail Gorbachev" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>&nbsp;visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country’s previous statements on the USSR’s peaceful intent.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-kornilov-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly. However, after disconnecting from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees. When the rocket fired, it slowed and burned up in the atmosphere over the south Pacific ocean. This failure was attributed to a faulty<a title="Inertial guidance system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_guidance_system">inertial guidance system</a>&nbsp;that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)#cite_note-grondine-4">[4]</a></p><br>

<p>NPO&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;received orders from the&nbsp;<a title="Government of the Soviet Union" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Soviet_Union">Soviet government</a>&nbsp;to begin research on space-based strike weapons in the mid-70s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s,&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;had proposed two programs: laser-equipped&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;and guided missiles platform&nbsp;Kaskad&nbsp;(where&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;would cover the low-orbit targets,&nbsp;Kaskad&nbsp;engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO&nbsp;Astrofizika&nbsp;and KBSalyut, they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the&nbsp;<a title="Salyut program" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_program">Salyut</a>&nbsp;DOS-17K frame.</p>
<p>Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called “pre-emptive retaliation” large-scale Soviet ICBM launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi0M3Kqk2yU/V6ih91L_cxI/AAAAAAAABQA/hQqNjrWW5-syquXFC5bw8VN7v7Wz33VVgCLcB/s1600/pole13.jpg"><img alt="Skif spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the Beriev A-60 aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser)" height="332" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hi0M3Kqk2yU/V6ih91L_cxI/AAAAAAAABQA/hQqNjrWW5-syquXFC5bw8VN7v7Wz33VVgCLcB/s640/pole13.jpg" title="Skif a combat laser)" width="640"></a></p><br>

<p>The laser chosen for the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon-dioxide laser, developed for the&nbsp;<a title="Beriev A-60" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beriev_A-60">Beriev A-60</a>&nbsp;aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the&nbsp;Energia, capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The massive exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser “recoil-less”. The&nbsp;zero-torque exhaust system&nbsp;(SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite’s purpose. Instead, the xenon-krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth’s&nbsp;<a title="Ionosphere" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>.</p>
<p>In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, which was still in the&nbsp;<a title="Testbed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testbed">testbed</a>&nbsp;phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission.</p>
<p>The launch May 15, 1987, shot by 24 cameras from different angles.</p>
<p>Prelaunch installation&nbsp;04.02.1987</p>
<p>The development of the real&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, the launch pad and the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the&nbsp;Energia&nbsp;launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev’s visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because “there will be heart attacks”.</p>
<p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif"><img alt="Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CwxOEC0MP1o/V6ij0CpjnyI/AAAAAAAABQQ/EkKtncbH2OM8cwUp419gnVtycH86sGcZACLcB/s1600/gud_anim.gif" title="Prelaunch installation 04.02.1987"></a></p>
<p>The catastrophic malfunction that led to&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;entering the atmosphere in the same area as&nbsp;Energia’s&nbsp;second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules’ covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn’t discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the&nbsp;Skif&nbsp;kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the&nbsp;<a title="Ballistic trajectory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trajectory">ballistic trajectory</a>.</p><br>

<p>Plane-overclockers</p>
<p>Powerful airship overclockers (weight 52 tons, length 38 meters, wingspan of 16.5 m) was dispersed to six times the speed of sound (6M), then with his “back” at an altitude of 28-30 km was supposed to start a 10-ton manned orbital plane 8 m long and 7.4 m span.</p>
<p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSes4d9bcsg/V6inJIfNtfI/AAAAAAAABQg/lqy4GYfzDyk1Pp_vJyG_SIqnIVVrvhkzgCLcB/s1600/spiral1.gif"><img alt="Plane-overclockers" height="262" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oSes4d9bcsg/V6inJIfNtfI/AAAAAAAABQg/lqy4GYfzDyk1Pp_vJyG_SIqnIVVrvhkzgCLcB/s640/spiral1.gif" title="Plane-overclockers" width="640"></a></p><br>

<p>“The plane-overclockers to 6 Mach suggests the possibility of use as a passenger plane, airliner, which, of course, was rational: its high speed characteristics would allow to raise the rate of civil aviation.”</p>
<p>Plane-overclockers was the first technologically revolutionary detailed design of hypersonic aircraft with jet engines. At the 40th Congress of the International Aeronautical Federation (the FAI), which took place in 1989 in Malaga (Spain), representatives of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA’s) gave the plane-overclockers high praise, noting that he “was designed in accordance with the modern requirements. “</p><br>

<p>In view of the requirements of a lot of money for brand new motor, aerodynamic and material science technologies for the creation of such a hypersonic-overclockers aircraft in the latest versions of the project was considered less costly and more quickly achievable possibility of creating not a hypersonic and supersonic overclockers, as is considered modified shock-reconnaissance aircraft T-4 ( “100”), however it was not realized.</p><br>

</p>
<div>
<p><strong>The email industry's got a GDPR problem.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent <a href="https://email.geeks.chat/">Email Geeks Community</a>, but if you're new, let me break it down for you.</p>
<p>Last year, the GDPR came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (PII) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as PII). </p>
<p>Now if you're reading this, you're probably familiar with how that's gone, so I won't bore you with the details.</p>

<h2>So What's the Problem?</h2>
<p>The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to them. This isn't strictly a problem, the GDPR does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking frequently fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>We're not collection consent to track user behaviour</strong> - That means we're probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that's frought with a number of risks.</p>
<p>Firstly, most brands aren't disclosing in their privacy policies or at moment of signup that they're tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That's a problem. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is further expanded upon in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/">Recital 39</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand's privacy policy is a clear breach of the regulation.</p>
<p>Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/">Right to Object</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second problem.</p>

<h2>Email Marketing Platforms Are Not GDPR Compliant†</h2>
<p>Take a look at your ESP, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email tracking?</p>
<p>If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you're in breach of the GDPR as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don't you're already in breach.</p>
<p>This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate Interest.</p>
<p>So what can you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Complain to your ESP!</strong> Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the GDPR is here to stay, and ESP's must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the law.</p>

<h2>Where Does That Leave Email Marketing?</h2>
<p>Email marketing isn't going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn't going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal data.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>That's not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our objectives.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we've become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it's time we get used to a world where that option isn't always going to be available to us. </p>
<hr>
<p>Usual caveats apply. I am not a lawyer.</p>
<p>† <em>Yes, I know a small minority are, but they're a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I'd recommend SFMC</em></p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

        

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This small ebook is here to teach you a programming language called Forth. Forth is a
language unlike most others. It’s not functional <em>or</em> object oriented, it doesn’t
have type-checking, and it basically has zero syntax. It was written in the 70s, but
is still used today for
<a href="http://www.forth.com/resources/apps/more-applications.html">certain applications</a>.</p>

<p>Why would you want to learn such an odd language? Every new programming
language you learn helps you think about problems in new ways. Forth is very
easy to learn, but it requires you to think in a different way than you’re used
to. That makes it a perfect language to broaden your coding horizons.</p>

<p>This book includes a simple implementation of Forth I wrote in JavaScript. It’s by
no means perfect, and is missing a lot of the functionality you’d expect in a real
Forth system. It’s just here to give you an easy way to try out the examples. (If
you’re a Forth expert, please
<a href="https://github.com/skilldrick/easyforth">contribute here</a> and make it better!)</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that you know at least one other programming language, and have
a basic idea of how stacks work as a data structure.</p>

<h2 id="adding-some-numbers">Adding Some Numbers</h2>

<p>The thing that separates Forth from most other languages is its use of the
stack. In Forth, everything revolves around the stack. Any time you type a
number, it gets pushed onto the stack. If you want to add two numbers together,
typing <code>+</code> takes the top two numbers off the stack, adds them, and puts
the result back on the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example. Type (don’t copy-paste) the following into the
interpreter, typing <code>Enter</code> after each line.</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
</code></pre>



<p>Every time you type a line followed by the <code>Enter</code> key, the Forth interpreter
executes that line, and appends the string <code>ok</code> to let you know there were no
errors. You should also notice that as you execute each line, the area at the
top fills up with numbers. That area is our visualization of the stack. It
should look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>Now, into the same interpreter, type a single <code>+</code> followed by the <code>Enter</code> key. The top two
elements on the stack, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>, have been replaced by <code>5</code>.</p>

<p>1 5 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>At this point, your editor window should look like this:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
</p>

<p>Type <code>+</code> again and press <code>Enter</code>, and the top two elements will be replaced by 6. If
you type <code>+</code> one more time, Forth will try to pop the top two elements off the
stack, even though there’s only <em>one</em> element on the stack! This results in a
<code>Stack underflow</code> error:</p>

<p>1  <span>ok</span>
2  <span>ok</span>
3  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>ok</span>
+  <span>Stack underflow</span>
</p>

<p>Forth doesn’t force you to type every token as a separate line. Type the
following into the next editor, followed by the <code>Enter</code> key:</p>

<pre><code>123 456 +
</code></pre>



<p>The stack should now look like this:</p>

<p>579 &lt;- Top</p>

<p>This style, where the operator appears after the operands, is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse-Polish
notation</a>. Let’s try
something a bit more complicated, and calculate <code>10 * (5 + 2)</code>. Type the
following into the interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>5 2 + 10 *
</code></pre>



<p>One of the nice things about Forth is that the order of operations is
completely based on their order in the program. For example, when executing <code>5
2 + 10 *</code>, the interpreter pushes 5 to the stack, then 2, then adds them and
pushes the resulting 7, then pushes 10 to the stack, then multiplies 7 and 10.
Because of this, there’s no need for parentheses to group operators with lower
precedence.</p>

<h3 id="stack-effects">Stack Effects</h3>

<p>Most Forth words affect the stack in some way. Some take values off the stack,
some leave new values on the stack, and some do a mixture of both. These “stack
effects” are commonly represented using comments of the form <code>( before -- after
)</code>. For example, <code>+</code> is <code>( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> - <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are the top two numbers
on the stack, and <code>sum</code> is the value left on the stack.</p>

<h2 id="defining-words">Defining Words</h2>

<p>The syntax of Forth is extremely straightforward. Forth code is interpreted as
a series of space-delimited words. Almost all non-whitespace characters are valid
in words. When the Forth interpreter reads a word, it checks to see if a
definition exists in an internal structure known as the Dictionary. If it is
found, that definition is executed. Otherwise, the word is assumed to be a
number, and it is pushed onto the stack. If the word cannot be converted to a
number, an error occurs.</p>

<p>You can try that out yourself below. Type <code>foo</code> (an unrecognized word)
and press enter.</p>



<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>foo  <span>foo ?</span></p>

<p><code>foo ?</code> means that Forth was unable to find a definition for <code>foo</code>, and it
wasn’t a valid number.</p>

<p>We can create our own definition of <code>foo</code> using two special words called <code>:</code>
(colon) and <code>;</code> (semicolon).  <code>:</code> is our way of telling Forth we want to create
a definition. The first word after the <code>:</code> becomes the definition name, and the
rest of the words (until the <code>;</code>) make up the body of the definition. It’s
conventional to include two spaces between the name and the body of the
definition. Try entering the following:</p>

<pre><code>: foo  100 + ;
1000 foo
foo foo foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> A common mistake is to miss out the space before the <code>;</code> word. Because Forth
words are space delimited and can contain most characters, <code>+;</code> is a perfectly
valid word and is not parsed as two separate words.</p>



<p>As you’ve hopefully figured out, our <code>foo</code> word simply adds 100 to the value on
top of the stack. It’s not very interesting, but it should give you an idea of
how simple definitions work.</p>

<h2 id="stack-manipulation">Stack Manipulation</h2>

<p>Now we can start taking a look at some of Forth’s predefined words. First,
let’s look at some words for manipulating the elements at the top of the stack.</p>

<h3 id="dup--n----n-n-"><code>dup ( n -- n n )</code></h3>

<p><code>dup</code> is short for “duplicate” – it duplicates the top element of the stack. For example,
try this out:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 dup
</code></pre>



<p>You should end up with the following stack:</p>

<p>1 2 3 3 &lt;- Top</p>

<h3 id="drop--n----"><code>drop ( n -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>drop</code> simply drops the top element of the stack. Running:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 drop
</code></pre>

<p>gives you a stack of:</p>

<p>1 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="swap--n1-n2----n2-n1-"><code>swap ( n1 n2 -- n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>swap</code>, as you may have guessed, swaps the top two elements of the stack. For example:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 4 swap
</code></pre>

<p>will give you:</p>

<p>1 2 4 3 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="over--n1-n2----n1-n2-n1-"><code>over ( n1 n2 -- n1 n2 n1 )</code></h3>

<p><code>over</code> is a bit less obvious: it takes the second element from the top of the
stack and duplicates it to the top of the stack. Running this:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 over
</code></pre>

<p>will result in this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 &lt;- Top</p>



<h3 id="rot--n1-n2-n3----n2-n3-n1-"><code>rot ( n1 n2 n3 -- n2 n3 n1 )</code></h3>

<p>Finally, <code>rot</code> “rotates” the top <em>three</em> elements of the stack. The third
element from the top of the stack gets moved to the top of the stack, pushing
the other two elements down.</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 rot
</code></pre>

<p>gives you:</p>

<p>2 3 1 &lt;- Top</p>



<h2 id="generating-output">Generating Output</h2>

<p>Next, let’s look at some words for outputting text to the console.</p>

<h3 id="n-----period"><code>. ( n -- )</code> (period)</h3>

<p>The simplest output word in Forth is <code>.</code>. You can use <code>.</code> to output the top of
the stack in the output of the current line. For example, try running this
(make sure to include all the spaces!):</p>

<pre><code>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . .
</code></pre>



<p>You should see this:</p>

<p>1 . 2 . 3 . 4 5 6 . . . <span>1 2 3 6 5 4  ok</span></p>

<p>Going through this in order, we push <code>1</code>, then pop it off and output it. Then
we do the same with <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. Next we push <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> onto the stack.
We then pop them off and output them one-by-one. That’s why the last three
numbers in the output are reversed: the stack is last in, first out.</p>

<h3 id="emit--c----"><code>emit ( c -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>emit</code> can be used to output numbers as ascii characters. Just like <code>.</code> outputs
the number at the top of the stack, <code>emit</code> outputs that number as an ascii
character. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 33 119 111 87 emit emit emit emit
</code></pre>



<p>I won’t give the output here so as to not ruin the surprise. This could also be
written as:</p>

<pre><code>87 emit 111 emit 119 emit 33 emit
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>.</code>, <code>emit</code> doesn’t output any space after each character, enabling you
to build up arbitrary strings of output.</p>

<h3 id="cr-----"><code>cr ( -- )</code></h3>

<p><code>cr</code> is short for carriage return – it simply outputs a newline:</p>

<pre><code>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .
</code></pre>



<p>This will output:</p>

<p>cr 100 . cr 200 . cr 300 .<span>
100
200
300  ok</span></p>

<h3 id="section"><code>." ( -- )</code></h3>

<p>Finally we have <code>."</code> – a special word for outputting strings. The <code>."</code> word works
differently inside definitions to interactive mode. <code>."</code> marks the beginning of
a string to output, and the end of the string is marked by <code>"</code>. The closing <code>"</code>
isn’t a word, and so doesn’t need to be space-delimited. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>: say-hello  ." Hello there!" ;
say-hello
</code></pre>



<p>You should see the following output</p>

<p>say-hello <span>Hello there! ok</span></p>

<p>We can combine <code>."</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>cr</code>, and <code>emit</code> to build up more complex output:</p>

<pre><code>: print-stack-top  cr dup ." The top of the stack is " .
  cr ." which looks like '" dup emit ." ' in ascii  " ;
48 print-stack-top
</code></pre>



<p>Running this should give you the following output:</p>

<p>48 print-stack-top <span>
The top of the stack is 48
which looks like '0' in ascii   ok</span></p>

<h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>

<p>Now onto the fun stuff! Forth, like most other languages, has conditionals and
loops for controlling the flow of your program. To understand how they work,
however, first we need to understand booleans in Forth.</p>

<h3 id="booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>There’s actually no boolean type in Forth. The number <code>0</code> is treated as false,
and any other number is true, although the canonical true value is <code>-1</code> (all
boolean operators return <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code>).</p>

<p>To test if two numbers are equal, you can use <code>=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 = .
5 5 = .
</code></pre>

<p>This should output:</p>

<p>3 4 = . <span>0  ok</span>
5 5 = . <span>-1  ok</span></p>



<p>You can use <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> for less than and greater than. <code>&lt;</code> checks to see if the
second item from the top of the stack is less than the top item of the stack, and
vice versa for <code>&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; .
3 4 &gt; .
</code></pre>

<p>3 4 &lt; . <span>-1  ok</span>
3 4 &gt; . <span>0  ok</span></p>



<p>The boolean operators And, Or, and Not are available as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code>:</p>

<pre><code>3 4 &lt; 20 30 &lt; and .
3 4 &lt; 20 30 &gt; or .
3 4 &lt; invert .
</code></pre>

<p>The first line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 &amp; 20 &lt; 30</code> in a C-based language.
The second line is the equivalent of <code>3 &lt; 4 | 20 &gt; 30</code>. The third line is the
equivalent of <code>!(3 &lt; 4)</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>invert</code> are all bitwise operations. For well-formed flags
(<code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>) they’ll work as expected, but they’ll give incorrect results for
arbitrary numbers.</p>



<h3 id="if-then"><code>if then</code></h3>

<p>Now we can finally get onto conditionals. Conditionals in Forth can only be
used inside definitions. The simplest conditional statement in Forth is <code>if
then</code>, which is equivalent to a standard <code>if</code> statement in most languages.
Here’s an example of a definition using …</p></section></div>

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/top-5-cloud-to-cloud-migration-woes-and-how-to-solve-them/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Lars Larsson, Senior Cloud Architect and Branch Manager</em> at <em>Elastisys</em></p>



<p>All companies that use cloud services do so for a reason. But those reasons may change. Whether motivated by the need for a multi-cloud strategy, expenditure minimization, legislative or regulatory demands, or simply to get closer to end users, many organizations find themselves migrating from one cloud to another. Cloud-to-cloud migration for a non-trivial application contains a lot of unknown unknowns. This causes stress and uncertainty for a CTO. To help shed some light based on years of experience in the field, we have asked senior cloud architect Lars Larsson at Elastisys, to list some of these issues.</p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, each with their own associated costs. Make sure to fully understand the situation as you make your calculations.</li><li>Providers tend to lock in customers via well-integrated services. These may make migration more difficult.</li><li>Make clear inventory of features and functionality your application requires of a managed service. These may or may not match what other cloud providers offer.</li><li>Also make an inventory of the tools and services supporting your organizational processes.</li><li>Take all these inventories into account to calculate your total cost of ownership for any cloud-to-cloud migration.</li><li>Use cloud native technologies to decouple your application and organization from the services offered by a particular cloud provider. This makes migration easier in the future.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Pricing models vary wildly</h2>



<p>Most companies have been hit by that one cloud bill that surprised them. Some services or features wound up costing far more than originally anticipated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you considering a cloud-to-cloud migration to reduce operational costs? If so, please take a long and hard look at the various costs in each of the clouds. Because each service has a different cost model, making it very difficult to compare accurately. You really need to get to the bottom of it.</p>



<p>Compute and storage costs are often easy enough to compare, because those are the most obvious two. But what about other services? How much are you spending on, e.g., log handling or monitoring? Good services such as AWS CloudWatch come at a cost, especially if you use it for log handling too (AWS CloudWatch Logs). Are you heavily using a managed database service? A queueing or pub/sub service?</p>



<p>Avoid feeling like that one time the surprise cloud bill hit you in the face by doing your homework this time. You are wiser from the experience, after all.</p>



<p>Network transfers in and out of the cloud can also vary by quite a large amount. The three major providers will give you incoming network traffic for free, but charge you for the outgoing traffic. Smaller, regional, cloud providers will often have higher compute and storage costs, but not charge you for network traffic. Or include a much larger amount of it in a free tier offering.</p>



<p>Overwhelming? I get it. It sure looks that way at first glance! But it doesn’t have to be. My trick is to look at your past few detailed billing statements, and map those costs to your new cloud provider options.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Deeply take all aspects of your current cloud billing into account. Find the differences between offerings, and make a more informed decision.</em></li></ul>



<h2>2. Cloud vendor-specific integrations</h2>



<p>Tell me, did you adopt Kubernetes to make yourself less dependent on cloud providers? Reduce vendor lock-in? Are you now surprised at finding out that you are still locked in, but on a different level?</p>



<p>What I’ve seen is that most organizations will make sure they have highly portable application definitions. By relying on Kubernetes, the application definitions work across cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I’ve also seen is that if you are using a managed Kubernetes service, your users and permissions handling is perhaps tied not to Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) features, but rather, to cloud-specific offerings. Like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Great service, but ties you to the AWS platform.</p>



<p>Fully-managed Kubernetes services, if offered by cloud vendors themselves, serve to offer a highly integrated experience. The cost of that integration is that migration to another cloud provider becomes just that certain amount more difficult.</p>



<p>As a community, we’ve tried to fix this. But as a community of engineers, those fixes are technical. Kubernetes dictates standards for certain components or aspects. Networking has to work according to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standard. Storage according to Container Storage Interface (CSI). And so on. Great. But the business people have put in much more clever ways of locking you to the platform. This means that other less obvious aspects are more difficult to freely migrate from one cloud to another.</p>



<p>So what is the option? Do you have to manage Kubernetes yourself? No. Of course not. But it may make sense to investigate managed Kubernetes offerings that are not tied to a particular cloud provider to reduce the risk of vendor lock-in. Without having to take on the task of day-to-day operations on your own, of course.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Investigate the ways in which cloud providers make migration more difficult due to incompatible integrations. Choose third-party vendors that are not tied to any particular cloud provider, and can offer their services on top of other cloud providers if need be.</em></li></ul>



<h2>3. The devil is in the (technical) details</h2>



<p>Almost all organizations I’ve talked to say the same thing. They went to the cloud because they wanted to get infrastructure or platform functionality on an as-a-Service basis. That is the whole point of the cloud, is it not?</p>



<p>So, of course, all cloud providers will offer certain services. It used to be just infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, network, and storage) but we are starting to also take, e.g., object storage and queuing services for granted. Many such services will claim to offer an “S3 compatible API” or similar. And that is a great starting point! But beware, because what does such a compatibility claim really mean?&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS S3, for example, was, until December 2020, merely eventually consistent. Since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/12/aws-s3-strong-consistency/">their announcement</a>, it is read-after-write consistent (strong consistency). Which level of consistency would a service that is “S3 compatible” have? The old one? Or the new one? And do you have aspects of your applications that depend on that answer being one or the other? Would you know off-hand?</p>



<p>If you don’t, by the way, you’re in excellent company. Most people’s eyes gloss over when consistency guarantees are discussed. But then again, you don’t want to get bitten by a bug caused by wrongful assumptions, so somebody has to stay awake to figure this stuff out. Hopefully not past midnight!</p>



<p>Ready for another unexciting example? Queuing services, such as AWS SQS, offer certain delivery guarantees. SQS standard queues offer “at least once” guarantees. That means that a message can be delivered to your application more than once, and must have logic in place for dealing with duplicates. An application that is not prepared for this will start showing strange behavior. Especially under heavy load, because that is when the risk for multiple deliveries is higher. This is because high load means there is less time to do housekeeping for the queuing service. (Note that while SQS offers FIFO queues that have “exactly once”&nbsp;<strong>processing</strong>&nbsp;guarantees, however, that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ably.io/blog/sqs-fifo-queues-message-ordering-and-exactly-once-processing-guaranteed">does not imply exactly once delivery</a>.) So confusing for an application that was coded with assumptions of RabbitMQ’s “at most once” delivery guarantees!</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The point I am making here is that you must make an inventory of all the cloud services you use, and what features in these are key to your applications working the way they are intended. Because&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;use case is the one that matters.</p>



<p>Cloud providers offer services that make certain trade-offs to ensure the scalability and availability&nbsp;<em>of their service</em>. From the perspective of individual customers and applications, the ideal trade-off choice might have been different. If you use a software such as RabbitMQ, you can configure it perfectly for your use case and requirements. Not the ones of the cloud providers. There are companies that offer managed services in a cloud-agnostic way. Especially on top of Kubernetes, which deserve your consideration.</p>



<ul><li><em>Key takeaway: Make a clear inventory of all cloud services you use, along with the required features of each for your use case. To make a cloud-to-cloud migration easier, start depending on software not tied to any particular provider.</em></li></ul>



<h2>4. Tools supporting your processes (may) change</h2>



<p>Industry wisdom and rule of thumb says that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.econnectivity.se/app-maintenance-cost-can-be-three-times-higher-than-development-cost/">about 70% of software costs</a>&nbsp;are in maintenance. Not development. Just keeping the thing running as intended. How do you address that? My take on it is to rely on smart tools and automation as much as possible. The less your staff has to work on rote menial tasks, the better. Everything they do is a process. So let’s talk about those processes.</p>



<p>Operating your mission-critical cloud application? A bunch of processes. And most, if not all, of these are supported by tools. Continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, notifications and alerting. These are the tools your operations staff is using to analyze and optimize your application deployment.</p>



<p>Great tools like AWS CloudWatch offer insight into monitoring, logging (CloudWatch Logs), and containerized workloads (CloudWatch Container Insights). Your team probably depends on them. But they are specific to a particular cloud vendor.</p>

<h2><span id="Kill_the_alarm_clock.21">Kill the alarm clock!</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_epidemic">Alarm clock epidemic</span></h3>
<p>Few upwardly mobile people in the modern rat-race society can live without an alarm clock. With a shot of strong coffee and round-the-clock stress, most people learn to live and survive with an alarm clock. Half of the population wakes up with an alarm, 9% are woken by a partner, 4% by pets, 3% by children, etc. That leaves a minority that wake up naturally. Increasingly, time becomes the most precious commodity in society where achievement is often associated with speed and perfect time-management. However, alarm clocks introduce harmful side effects: stress, sleep debt, and worst of all, disruption of the natural physiological sleep function. At worst, those factors will result in physical damage to the brain (e.g. such sensitive structures as the hippocampus, your memory switchboard, may literally <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">lose neurons as a result of disrupted sleep</a>).
</p><p>The art of time-management makes it possible to live at a high speed with an alarm clock at your side, and still be free from <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Factors_that_affect_sleep#Stress" title="Factors that affect sleep">stress</a>. However, the societal damage inflicted by alarm clocks and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> is unforgivable. An alarm clock that interrupts your sleep damages your memories, your ability to learn, your creativity, your mood and temper, your relationships with other people, your ability to focus, and your overall intellectual performance!
</p><p>Dr Robert Stickgold has shown that people who learn a skill during the day do not show significant improvement until they get 7-8 hours of good sleep<sup id="cite_ref-stickgold-2005_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-stickgold-2005-1">[1]</a></sup>. There was a noticeable correlation between the degree of improvement and the quality of sleep received. My own work with <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_habits#SleepChart_in_SuperMemo" title="Sleep habits">SleepChart</a> also shows that the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_and_learning#Alarm_clock_vs._learning" title="Sleep and learning">use of alarm clocks can dramatically reduce memory recall and consolidation</a>. Forgetting is so painless that we rarely notice its effects. In a natural way, forgetting will proceed even if you get as much sleep as you need, and it is difficult to point to specific memories lost as a result of not sleeping enough. Moreover, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">sleep deprivation may leave your memories intact while their storage will be sub-optimum</a>. The difference may be impossible to spot without measurement. We are more likely to notice sleepiness, reduced mental agility, or bad mood.
</p><p>Disrespect for sleep has reached biblical proportions. This is most noticeable in the US and other highly industrialized nations. <i>Men's Health's</i> Dan Vergano writing for <i>ABC News</i> in <i>"No More Rude Awakenings"</i> suggests a seven-day system for fighting sleepiness: <i>"The secret is to fuel that arousal system so it can <b>beat the pants off the sleep system</b>. By creating the kind of feel-good expectations that trigger hormones to wake the brain, you’ll override the need to sleep and be able to jump out of bed like a man on fire"</i>. The article suggests a "fresh" mind method that capitalizes on the fact that stress hormones help keep you alert. However, the only rational remedy for <i>"rude awakenings"</i> is simple: get enough sleep! Jumping <i>like a man on fire</i> is not likely to have a positive effect on your creative potential!
</p><p>You may often notice that waking up with an alarm clock gives you a jumpstart for the day. You may then come to believe that using the alarm clock might help you stay alert later in the day. This is not the case. The alarm signal simply scares your brain into wakefulness, disrupting the carefully planned process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep#Neural_optimization_in_sleep" title="Memory optimization in sleep">neural optimization</a> that occurs in sleep. As a result, you get an immediate injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline">adrenaline</a> and your levels of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTH">ACTH</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">cortisol</a> also increase. This is cortisol that peaks at awakening in natural sleeping rhythm that provides you with the fresh-mind impression. With passing time, this cheaply gained alertness will wear thin unless you continue abusing your physiology with more "remedies". You may use more scare tactics for keeping yourself alert, abuse caffeine, or even get a more profound effect with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">modafinil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. Alertness should be achieved with the help of sufficient sleep, not despite the lack of sleep! Apart from your reduced ability to learn new things, all unnatural anti-drowsiness methods will produce a great deal of side effects that can be pretty damaging to your health in the long run.
</p><p>All efforts to overcome sleepiness by means other than sleep itself can be likened to a chase of the first high in the use of psychoactive substances. If you drink buckets of coffee, do pushups, pour cold water over your head, or slap your face, you only dip into the last reserves of your alertness hormones that only worsen the effects of deprivation after the effects of the stimulation wear off, which is usually a matter of minutes. Rarely can you get a boost lasting more than an hour, and the more you perk up, the lower you fall in the aftermath.

<h3><span id="Insomnia_trap">Insomnia trap</span></h3>
<p>If your life without an alarm clock may seem like an impossibility, you will probably need to use all methods in the book to be sure you get enough sleep and minimize the damage. If you need to wake up early at the cost of your brain, avoid the <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia trap</a></b>! Insomnia trap is a vicious circle of:
</p>
<ol><li> going to sleep too early to get more sleep,</li>
<li> failing to fall asleep in time (or worse, waking up prematurely),</li>
<li> feeling even more tired on the next day, and</li>
<li> going to sleep even earlier on the next day to catch up with the lost sleep.</li></ol>
<p>It is better to go to sleep at a natural hour (i.e. a bit later), wake up early, suffer a degree of sleep deprivation, and hope for a phase reset that will make it possible to continue on the <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">designer schedule</a>. For a solution to the insomnia trap see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia" title="Curing DSPS and insomnia">Curing DSPS and insomnia</a>.
</p><p>If you cannot reset your phase and still feel tired when getting up early on a regular basis, consider choosing a job that is acceptable for your body, not the other way around. Your long-term health and well-being is at stake. If you absolutely cannot live without an alarm clock, you can at least start from changing your mindset about the importance of sleep and ensure you do not impose wrong habits on your children. Perhaps the young ones will be lucky enough to work in a flex-time system that will make it possible to get sufficient amount of undisturbed sleep. At least, do not set a bad example!

<h3><span id="Wake_up_the_President">Wake up the President</span></h3>
<p>President Bill Clinton was woken up twice by telephone during the night of April 22, 2000 before the infamous I.N.S. raid on the home of Miami relatives of the young Cuban exile Elian Gonzales. He was probably the most often disrupted and sleep deprived president in history. Only after a heart surgery did Clinton take diet, sleep and (real) exercise seriously. Those interrupted nights would definitely influence his performance and the quality of his decisions! Has anybody thought of a rule: <i>Do not wake up the president?</i> A rule that could only be revoked in a true national emergency? President G. W. Bush (b. 1946) was woken up when an American spy plane landed in China in 2001. He was also woken up after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002. George H. W. Bush (b. 1924) and Hilary Clinton made "waking up in the middle of the night" part of their presidential campaign and prowess. It seems that only Ronald Reagan had pretty strong rules for protecting his own sleep. He also famously napped during some cabinet meetings. He slept through a couple of international events without an apparent negative impact on his somewhat delayed decision-making. Critics would say he slept through the entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra affair</a>. Was Reagan so protective of sleep because he understood the role of sleep better, or perhaps he was just a bit lazier than other presidents? I don't know. However, he sure set a good example.

<h3><span id="Alarm_clock_monsters">Alarm clock monsters</span></h3>
<p>Andrea K. wrote to me with skepticism: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Take the alarm clock away from a typical person and they won't just wake up on their own at their desired time and they will miss work, school, or whatever. An alarm clock can't be that bad for you because of the simple fact that most people use it and I never noticed any problem with them&nbsp;:) Everyone in my family has been using one since they were children, and no one suddenly went crazy or began to mutate into a monster (yet)!"</i></p></blockquote> 
<p>When you use an alarm early in the morning in order to get to work or to school, you cut off the later stages of sleep. If the intrusion into natural sleep is not large (e.g. from minutes to an hour), the damage may be limited and hard to notice. Alarm clock will do far more damage if it cuts deep into the middle of the night sleep. You can compare the use of alarm clocks to smoking or eating hot dogs. The harm is not great enough to be instantly noticeable. It took the public many years to largely accept that "smoking is bad" or "fast food is bad". It is hard to quantify the degree of damage. However, as we move to knowledge society where our intellectual performance becomes increasingly important, the effects of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> will come under closer scrutiny and alarm clocks are bound to gradually fall out of favor. Unlike hot dogs, they are already universally hated by their users. Most people are able to somewhat adapt their sleep to their schedules if their routines are regular enough. When those people need to resort to the use of the alarm clock, they cut less of their sleep and the damage is proportionally smaller. Nevertheless, we should always strive at eliminating alarm clocks altogether. Most of all, we should protect our kids from suffering interrupted sleep!
