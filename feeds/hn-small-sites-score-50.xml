<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Be a creator, not just a consumer<br></h2><p>I sit down every weekend to write. It’s a routine I’ve deliberately cultivated for myself during this year as a way to get out of my own head and put my thoughts on (metaphorical) paper. </p><p>It started with this post on cultivating a <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/daily-writing-habit" target="_blank">daily writing habit</a>, which I moved away from after <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/writing-25-blog-posts-in-25-days" target="_blank">25 days</a> into a weekly schedule.</p><p>Some of my writings go out as tweet threads, others as blog posts on this site. Invariably, I am creating and publishing week after week.</p><p>It's not just to achieve end goal (follow systems, not goals) that I write every week. I thoroughly enjoy the process of creation, the act of sitting with lo-fi or synthwave tunes in the background and punching away at the keyboard brain dumping onto a notepad.</p><p>I’ve managed to get <a href="https://www.sankalpjonna.com/all-posts" target="_blank">Sankalp</a> (my co-founder) onto writing as well. He’s still working out a schedule that helps him create and publish good content consistently, but he’s started walking the treadmill which is the important part.</p><p>Recently I’ve been engaging with my team at DelightChat to get into a regular publishing routine. <a href="https://www.akashj.com/" target="_blank">Akash</a> already writes occasionally, Deb published his podcast on <a href="https://saascontentatscale.com/" target="_blank">SaaS content marketing</a>, and Niraj is setting up his blog as we speak.</p><p>However, I didn’t want to be some old fart, a preacher who is saying “get on the horse” without explaining the why.</p><p>So here goes.<br></p><h2>Reasons to write</h2><p>Before proceeding further, I must make one thing clear. While I personally prefer writing, the message here is to create stuff. </p><p>Create art, design album covers, shoot vlogs, record podcasts, write code. The focus is on creation, and becoming a creator in a world where most people are only consuming.</p><p>Here’s how I explained the importance of writing and being a creator to my team.</p><p>The whole world and everything in it, people and entities, are connected by invisible strings. You can visualise it like a web, an interconnected web with billions of points. </p><p>Yes, I’m describing the model of the internet. Yes it’s more relevant than ever, because until recently majority of the world wasn’t online and connected to each other. With over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/" target="_blank">4.57 billion</a> people on the internet, we are literally living in the interconnected web. And hence it’s important for you to visualise and grasp the enormity of it.</p><p>Back to reasons.</p><p>You can take this giant web of interconnected beings and entities, and splice it in any direction you want. And you always end up with a subset of people. </p><figure id="w-node-5239bfbcbdf9-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f817d2c1f8d6ba3787fa59e_node%20network%20map%20of%20the%20internet.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>A map of the internet. Which cross-section will you splice?</em></figcaption></figure><p>Example of a large splice - people who enjoy listening to music.</p><p>Example of a smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock music.</p><p>Even smaller splice - people who enjoy alternative rock and compose tracks and sing in a band in the same genre.</p><p>You can take this concept and apply it to any idea and pull at the strings.</p><p>With this blog post, I’m pulling at the strings that connect people who want to create stuff, have the ability to create stuff, and want to get started but haven’t yet. More specifically, my blog might appeal to people who have the ability and desire to write.</p><p>Anyway, now you have identified a splice or subset. What next?</p><p>The question really becomes, how do you make yourself a valuable entity in a given subset or splice of this giant interconnected web? How do you become a valuable node.</p><p>And there’s only one answer to it.</p><p>The only way to become a valuable node is by pushing/publishing/releasing value into the web. But like an ocean, a drop won’t be noticed by anybody. You need a pond where you can make a splash. </p><p>You need to narrow down and focus on a small enough splice, such that when you tug at its strings, you have a real chance to get noticed. That way the value that you create in the form of written, video, audio, code, etc about topics that your narrow splice of the web cares about has a chance of earning their attention.</p><p>There is no other way. It’s not going to be easy. Many others are trying to grab the same splice of attention. </p><p>But, life is not a zero sum game. </p><p>Multiple people can win. You can win too.</p><p>And that’s brings me to the #1 reason to write or create stuff.</p><p><strong>You can’t win if you don’t participate.</strong><br></p><h2>Common obstacles to writing</h2><p>From my conversations with people, I’ve found the most common obstacles to be</p><ol role="list"><li>You don’t know why to write or create stuff</li><li>You don’t know what to write about</li><li>You don’t have a schedule or consistency</li><li>Procrastination (the human mind is marvelous)</li></ol><p>I’ve already solved the first problem by explaining the why. <br></p><h3>Create a consistent writing schedule</h3><p>The third problem can be solved by committing to a schedule. <a href="https://jamesclear.com/scale" target="_blank">James Clear</a> published on Mondays and Thursdays for three years until his blog finally took off. The rest we already know about. </p><p>I committed to a daily writing schedule at first, which was hard but it helped me get out of my rut. This commitment was made in public and to my girlfriend in person. </p><p>The two factors combined pushed me enough to get over my mental barriers and keep writing daily, especially on days I didn’t feel like. Back then I was writing shorter posts, which I’ve traded for longer thought pieces once a week.</p><p>You too can set a simple but achievable routine. </p><p>Set a reminder on Fridays to think of a topic to create about, spend a few hours on Saturday punching the keyboard furiously until you’ve dumped all your thoughts on paper, and then edit it before hitting publish on Sunday. </p><p>The DelightChat team has a recurring event on the calendar to help maintain a consistent creator schedule.</p><figure id="w-node-1e110a69cf8d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f81679d2365946712414656_consistent%20writing%20schedule%20write%20weekly.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Remember to set a target that’s easy enough to achieve. You’re not aiming for the pulitzer prize, you are trying to create a habit that’s super easy to do, thereby reducing chances of failure.</p><h3>Overcome writing procrastination</h3><p>Here are a few common procrastination arrows your brain is going to shoot at you. I’m going to make you aware of them so you can dodge them. <br></p><p><strong>“I don’t have time to write.”</strong></p><p>Create a schedule, commit to it, tell your friends, family or someone who will ask you and therefore hold you accountable.<br></p><p><strong>“I don’t know what to write about.”</strong></p><p>I’ve answered that in the next section.<br></p><p><strong>“Ding! New notification from WhatsApp.”</strong></p><p>Pour oil on your phone, throw it in the dustbin, and light it on fire.</p><p>Or, you could put it on silent and place it exactly behind your laptop screen (out of eyesight). Has served me well.</p><p><strong>"I don't have something interesting to say. I only want to write if I have something unique to say."</strong></p><p>You are a unique person with a unique perspective and thoughts about life due to your unique circumstances and upbringing and the hundreds and thousands of experiences you've had up until now.</p><p>You have something unique to say. The topic might be old (it always is), but your unique perspective, your anecdotal experience, all add up.<br></p><p><strong>“But I need to setup my blog, set up markdown, and more.”</strong></p><p>No, you need to write. Writing is the goal, not integrating markdown.<br></p><p><strong>“But the text editor I use isn’t friendly. It doesn’t integrate with my blog.”</strong></p><p>Google Keep or Apple Notes works perfectly and is very distraction free. </p><p>Blow up the font size until you can’t see anything else on the screen. It’s what I do and it works.</p><p>Your real challenge, and the only one that matters is sitting down and penning your thoughts, or creating stuff. You can do it on a piece of paper (but do it on Google Keep or Apple Notes, seriously).<br></p><p><strong>“But should I publish on Medium, on Substack, how do I format it into a tweet thread, etc.”</strong></p><p>The medium can come later. The medium is a constraint. </p><p>Constraints can be walked around of using creativity. But it's not a limiting factor by any means. </p><p><strong>Your goal is to write or create.</strong><br></p><p>There is no perfect moment, the right time to start, or a sign from the universe where you suddenly kick procrastination in the face and get started. There is only the here and now.</p><figure id="w-node-3259c2c4fa4e-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8275f05451d7829eeee560_beat%20procrastination%20there%20is%20no%20sign%20from%20the%20universe.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href="https://unsplash.com/@austinchan" target="_blank"><em>Austin Chan</em></a><em> </em></figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully these prompts I've written will help you dodge your brain’s procrastination bullets.<br></p><h2>What to write about</h2><p>Throughout the week I gather ideas on what to write about </p><ul role="list"><li>from conversations with my co-founder, team and other people, </li><li>by observing what others have written about and if I have a perspective to share, </li><li>thoughts circling in my head, </li></ul><p>and so on..</p><p>There’s infinite sources for gathering ideas, but it’s important to have an eye for catching ideas (similar to how one can train themselves to spot business or startup ideas). </p><p>And it's equally important to jot down those ideas somewhere safe and easy to access.</p><p>I have a private WhatsApp group to drop ideas whenever I have them.</p><figure id="w-node-3fbdec9be5eb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f8166d013df6c908d268c79_writing%20ideas%20store%20in%20whatsapp%20group.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Sankalp was facing a problem with coming up with topics to write about.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>A few days ago I had an idea for a silly skit that I would post on TikTok. I spent about 5-10 minutes filming it with no script or plan and posted it on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shmemmmy/video/6880323857903799558?source=h5_m">my TikTok</a> and my <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1313303791186268160?s=20">Twitter</a>. I went to bed and in the morning was awoken to messages from my friends and acquaintances that I was suddenly on the front page of Reddit.</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0dpllvD.png" alt="My video on the front page of reddit" width="400px">
</p>

<p>I was excited about going viral and initially happy that people were liking my silly little video, but of course, as a woman with her face and body suddenly in front of millions of people, that faded quickly.</p>

<p>The video was shared on a programming humor subreddit (without attribution I might add), but my annoyance and fear wasn’t in the missed clout or internet points, but it was that I lost control of being able to delete the post, delete comments, or block commenters when it was posted on a new platform.</p>

<p>Here’s just a small example of the comments that started streaming in</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pYyqNRq.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BsaeIjB.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BOXJoSG.png" alt="Sexist and sexualized commentary" width="400px">
</p>

<p>And how did this impact me personally? While the video was going viral, I felt like prey and couldn’t focus. I knew people were watching, judging, possibly trying to find me elsewhere on the internet to harass me in real-time. I started getting notifications people were trying to log in to my internet accounts. I locked everything down with 2FA (which I should have had anyway). My past experiences have primed me to expect the worse and feel foolish to hope for the best.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-next">What happened next:</h3>

<p>I reported all of the terrible comments (as did friends) but ~24 hours later, almost none of them had been removed. I reached out to the moderators of the subreddit with an appeal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is my first time being posted on Reddit, and I’m a bit disappointed by the moderation here. There are clearly disgusting sexual comments directed at me and unrelated to the video content or programming humor ranging from the stupid (“boobs”) to the more troublesome - including people directing people to go to my social media to get a better look at my body parts and violent imagery about me. All of these comments I have been reporting over the past 24 hours and very few of them have been removed.</p>

  <p>I would hope you can be more vigilant about moderating these types of comments because it does not create a very welcoming environment for women in tech. The sub isn’t SexistProgrammerHumor and I am personally seeing and reading these sexualized comments about my body (as are thousands of other people including my friends, partner, acquaintances, and coworkers).</p>

  <p>I would urge you to please add a new sub rule about these types of comments if you are interested in being a more welcoming place where I would feel comfortable posting my content. Also if a woman is the subject of a viral post, these types of comments and behavior should be expected and nipped in the bud as unacceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t expecting much but the next day I received a response which was basically the best I could have hoped for. I do appreciate the response, and here’s to hoping this doesn’t happen on this sub again, but of course there are thousands of other subs/communities online and other women posting content still out there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First I’d like to apologize for what happened here, this is seriously unacceptable and we really screwed up moderating this as the tread should’ve been locked way earlier. I’ve removed most if not all of the offending comments and the most egregious offenders have been permanently banned.</p>

  <p>We’re definitely going to adjust our rules to ban sexualized comments of any kind, since again any behaviour like this is unacceptable and I’m sorry we didn’t have clearer rules for this earlier.</p>

  <p>We’re also going to look into enlisting more mods, to help us better manage situations like this.</p>

  <p>We’re here to help in any way we can, so please don’t hesitate to write back if anything else is going wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure some of you have thoughts about this and I will try to address them.</p>

<h3 id="but-content-creators-should-expect-some-level-of-criticism-on-the-internet">“But content creators should expect some level of criticism on the internet”</h3>

<p>Yes, you are correct. And there were some actual “criticisms” posted that I was able to brush off easily. One example: “You can see her hand move when she is starting/pausing the filming”. And you’re right! My video editing skills for a silly TikTok I didn’t know was going to go viral were sub-par and this is a valid criticism.</p>

<p>But there’s a huge difference between a critique of the filming process and threads discussing me personally - everything about how annoying my voice is to debating my breast size (and directing people to go look at my social media to settle the debate). Whether you think these constitute valid criticisms or not, I think we can agree it will make people feel unsafe.</p>

<p>I didn’t post the video on Reddit myself for this exact reason. I find it to be a pretty toxic place for women and POC. There are places on Reddit where this commentary is allowed and even encouraged (see all the NSFW and controversial subreddits), but a programming humor subreddit allowing this is just continuing the trend of making women feel unwelcome in this industry.</p>



<p>While at first, it seems like a solid idea to ignore the haters, so to speak, first of all, if no one is reading the worst comments, we’re not reporting these things so nothing will ever change. Secondly, a discussion that starts as mild can escalate to doxxing, organized dogpiling, or threats. Not knowing that this is happening could be dangerous.  </p>

<h3 id="these-people-are-just-incels-and-the-scum-of-the-internet">“These people are just incels and the scum of the internet”</h3>

<p>When I was in college there were 2 anonymous message boards (YikYak and ACB) where students would post terribly racist and sexist things in addition to harassing individual girls at the school (not me because I wasn’t popular). It’s especially alarming to me that this was at an Ivy League school where most of these kids were raised “well” and would continue to go on to start companies, go to the best graduate programs, and be the “future leaders” of our world. And I’m sure most of these kids would have NEVER said any of those things in person, but being anonymous gives you a strange power and a weird desire to say harmful things.</p>

<p>I think people rush to dismiss these trolls as “the scum of the internet incels”, but I think that this is wrong. I think it’s way closer to home than that. I think they are Ivy League grads, fellow software engineers in SF, and people I ride the subway with. Normal people who really live normal lives in real life, but take out some internal rage online under the veil of anonymity.</p>

<p>Further, I think dismissing them as lost causes or “just trolls” minimizes the problem and gives an excuse for their behavior.</p>

<h3 id="i-know-what-some-of-you-are-still-thinking-i-agree-that-its-bad-but-when-you-put-yourself-out-there-on-the-internet-this-should-be-expected">I know what some of you are still thinking. “I agree that it’s bad, but when you put yourself out there on the internet, this should be expected”</h3>

<p>I think this is bullshit. Why should a woman have to expect to be harassed every time she puts herself out there online?</p>

<p>If somehow, you’ve made it this far as someone who has posted a nasty comment under the safety of anonymity before, I urge you to consider your words and how you are contributing to unsafe communities.</p>

<p>Platforms and their moderators can stop turning a blind eye to this type of behavior. It’s time to spend some resources, set clear rules, and enforce them. Your bottom line won’t matter if more than half of the human race feels unsafe on your platform.</p>

<p>I think we can all do better. We can call out and report this behavior as unacceptable when we see it. We can ask for and expect our communities to be held to a higher standard. I call on all of you to see and report these things. While it is not ideal that the onus is on us to take action, if we see it and don’t report it, nothing will ever change.</p>

<p>Maybe one day a woman will be able to post a silly video on the internet without fear.</p>

But it may surprise consumers to learn what can actually happen to all those unwanted items.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A <em>Marketplace</em> investigation into Amazon Canada has found that perfectly good items are being liquidated by the truckload&nbsp;— and even destroyed or sent to landfill. Experts say hundreds of thousands of returns don't end up back on the e-commerce giant's website for resale, as customers might think. &nbsp;</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> journalists posing as potential new clients went undercover for a tour at a Toronto e-waste recycling and product destruction facility with hidden cameras. During that meeting, a representative revealed they get "tons and tons of Amazon returns," and that every week their facility breaks&nbsp;apart and shreds&nbsp;at least one tractor-trailer load of Amazon returns, sometimes even up to three to five truckloads. &nbsp;</p>  <p>"We're not the only ones. We couldn't handle all of Amazon. There's no way. It is so — it's like cockroaches, it multiplies.

	<p><small>September 29, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently in the Fediverse, I read <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104927850229553836">this toot</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you know that #Unix groups have passwords? Apparently if you set
one, you then have to use newgrp to log in to that group.</p>

<p>I have never seen anyone use unix group passwords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Via <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye">@mhoye</a>.)</p>

<p>There are some things to say about this, but the first thing you
might wonder is why the <code>newgrp</code> command exists at all. The best
answer is that it's mostly a Unix historical relic (or, to put it
another way, a fossil).</p>

<p>In basically all current Unixes, processes can be in multiple groups
at once, often a lot of them. However this is a feature added in
BSD; it wasn't the case in the original Research Unixes, including
V7, and for a long time it wasn't the case in System V either. In
those Unixes, you could be listed as a member of various groups in
<code>/etc/groups</code>, but a given process was only in one group at a time.
The <code>newgrp</code> command was how you switched back and forth between
groups.</p>

<p>In general, <code>newgrp</code> worked in the way you'd expect, given Unix.  It was
a setuid root program that switched itself into the new group and then
<code>exec</code>'d into your shell (after carefully dropping its setuid powers).</p>

<p>(The actual behavior of <code>newgrp</code> in V7 is an interesting topic,
but that's for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/NewgrpV7Behavior">another entry</a>.)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/">tuhs.org</a>, a
<code>newgrp</code> command appears in Research Unix V6, but it doesn't seem
to be in V5. You could have written one, though, as there was a
<code>setgid()</code> system call at least as far back as V4 (and V4 may be
where the idea of groups was invented). Somewhat to my surprise,
the existence of group passwords also dates back to V6 Unix.</p>

<p>(Before I started looking into this, I would have guessed that group
passwords were added somewhere in the System III/System V line of AT&amp;T
Unix, as AT&amp;T adopted it to 'production' usage.)</p>

<p>PS: I'm pleased to see that OpenBSD seems to have dropped the <code>newgrp</code>
command at some point. Linux and FreeBSD both continue to have it, and I
can't imagine that Illumos, Solaris, or any other surviving commercial
Unixes have gotten rid of it either.</p>

  Intro

</h2>
<p>Making code run fast on GPUs requires a very different approach to making code run fast on CPUs because the hardware architecture is fundamentally different. If you come from a background of efficient coding on CPU then you’ll have to adjust some assumptions about what patterns are best.</p>
<p>Machine learning engineers of all kinds should care about squeezing performance from their models and hardware — not just for production purposes, but also for research and training. In research as in development, a fast iteration loop leads to faster improvement.</p>
<p>This article is a practical deep dive into making a specific deep learning model (<a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">Nvidia’s SSD300</a>) run fast on a powerful GPU server, but the general principles apply to all GPU programming. The SSD300 is an object-detection model trained on COCO, so output will be bounding boxes with probabilities for 81 classes of object.</p>

  How Far Can We Push a Python-based Inference Pipeline?
  <a href="#how-far-can-we-push-a-python-based-inference-pipeline">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Part of the point of this article is to see what throughput we can get without leaving behind the flexibility of Python or the familiarity of the library the model was created with (Pytorch). We will not go super deep into custom CUDA kernels or use a standard “serving” framework because we will find many large optimizations available at a high level. We’ll start from a naively implemented simple video inference pipeline, following on from my introductory <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pytorch_pipeline/">Pytorch Video Pipeline</a> article.</p>
<p>Sample code is here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/pytorch-video-pipeline">github.com/pbridger/pytorch-video-pipeline</a>.</p>

<p>The baseline version of the code will use the postprocessing functions in the <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">SSD300</a> repo as per the <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_ssd/">PyTorch Hub page</a>. The implementers of this model do not pretend this sample code is production ready and we will find many ways to improve it. In fact, the published <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Detection/SSD#inference-performance-results">benchmarking results</a> for this model do not run the postprocessing code at all.</p>

<p>The important parts are highlighted above:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>buffer_to_image_tensor</code> converts Gstreamer buffers (decoded from video frames) into Pytorch tensors.</li>
<li><code>preprocess</code> turns the 0 to 255 integral RGB pixel values into scaled -1.0 to +1.0 float values.</li>
<li><code>detector(image_batch)</code> runs the SSD300 model, and it’s important to note that the model and input tensor are on a CUDA device (GPU) at this point.</li>
<li><code>postprocess</code> turns model output into bounding boxes and scores for each class label.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will dig into these functions later, for now let’s examine baseline performance.</p>

  Tracing with Nvidia Nsight Systems

<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems">Nsight Systems</a> is a great tool to help with high-level GPU tuning. It shows CPU/GPU resource utilization, and is able to trace OS system calls, CUDA, CuDNN, CuBLAS, NVTX and even some technologies we don’t care about.</p>
<p>NVTX is an important API we’ll use for instrumenting regions and events in our code — this will be allow us to map traced utilization patterns to logic in the code.</p>
<p>Having run the baseline video pipeline with tracing enabled, opening Nsight Systems shows around 40 seconds of activity decoding and processing the video file (click for full resolution):</p>

<p>As you can see, there is plenty of information. Nsight Systems shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource utilization over time aggregated by hardware device (different CPUs and GPUs).</li>
<li>Resource utilization over time aggregated into processes and threads.</li>
<li>Call duration for numerous toolkits, including OS calls and the custom NVTX ranges I’ve put in our code. These will become clear as we zoom in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve added annotations for some problems that are clear even at this very high level. CPU usage is high, GPU usage is low, and there are a lot of memory transfers between host (system memory) and device (GPU memory).</p>
<p>Let’s drill in to show processing for a couple of frames. Note the NTVX ranges in grey corresponding to logical parts of the code:</p>








<a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video_analytics_pipeline_tuning/images/tuning_baseline_two_frames.png">

        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Postprocessing taking &gt;90% of elapsed time is a disaster — from a high-level this is the first thing to fix, but what is causing it?</p>
<p>During postprocessing we can see that CPU usage is very high, GPU usage is very low (but not 0%), and there are constant memory transfers from device to host. The most likely scenario is that the postprocessing is largely being done on CPU, but it is constantly pulling small pieces of data from the GPU required for the processing.</p>
<p>Let’s drill in to show activity for a couple of milliseconds:</p>

        <figcaption><small></small></figcaption>
    </figure>
</a>

<p>Looking at the CUDA API timeline, we can see a lot of memory transfers and the green synchronization around them. The CUDA synchronization calls are further evidence that this postprocessing is being done partly on CPU and partly on GPU and is synchronized in a very fine-grained fashion. Let’s fix it.</p>
<p>Here is the baseline postprocessing code:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>At the point of the highlighted line, the arguments <code>locs</code> and <code>labels</code> are tensors on the GPU (these are returned directly from the SSD300 inference). The <code>decode_results</code> code is accessing the tensors elementwise and doing work on CPU, causing the repeated fine-grained requests for data to be sent from GPU to system memory.</p>
<p>The initial fix is super simple — we will send these entire tensors to system memory in a single operation.</p>

<p>Running the baseline code without tracing enabled gave us 9 FPS throughput and this improved code runs at just under 16 FPS. A 78% improvement is not bad for just typing <code>.cpu()</code> twice. This leads to a good rule of thumb for GPU programming:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Avoid Fine-Grained Synchronization</strong></p>
<p>Your host (CPU) code is dispatching work to an incredibly powerful co-processor which can do complex work asynchronously. However, host/device communication latency and synchronization are costly — try to dispatch large chunks of work and avoid fine-grained memory transfers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The updated Nsight Systems view showing processing for two frames (below) has a clear difference. Instead of a constant stream of small transfers from device to host we now see one large transfer at the start of the postprocessing phase.</p>

<p>Postprocessing still takes over 80% of frame-processing time and the process is still heavily CPU bottlenecked. What if we could do the postprocessing using the GPU?</p>

<p>Turning preprocessing and postprocessing into heavily vectorized GPU code can be tricky for some models but is one of the highest-impact performance improvements you can make.</p>

<p><em>Cloud native storage tool has grown its contributor base by 260% since joining CNCF&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – October 7, 2020 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Rook. To move from the maturity level of <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">incubation to graduation</a> Rook has demonstrated growing adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity.</p>



<p>Rook is an open source cloud native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud native environments. Rook delivers its services via a Kubernetes Operator for each storage provider. It was originally accepted as a CNCF project in 2018. It is the thirteenth CNCF project, and the first project based on block, file, or object storage, to graduate.</p>



<p>“Storage is an important aspect of any cloud native deployment, and Rook fills a gap for teams who historically ran persistent storage outside of cloud native environments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO/COO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Rook is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes through the operator paradigm, we are excited to see the project graduate and look forward to cultivating their growing community.”</p>



<p>Since joining CNCF, user adoptions, the community ecosystem, and project maturity have been steadily growing and improving. Rook is being used in production by several companies, including Calit2 UCSD, Finleap Connect, Geodata, and many <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">others</a>.</p>



<p>The maintainer team currently consists of <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/OWNERS.md">7 members</a>, with a healthy distribution of organizations including Cloudical, Nexenta, Red Hat, Suse, and Upbound. Since becoming an incubating project in September 2018, contributors to the core Rook repository have grown by 260% from 90 to 279. Over the last 12 months, 184 <a href="https://rook.devstats.cncf.io/d/22/prs-authors-table?orgId=1&amp;var-period_name=Last%20year&amp;var-repogroup_name=All">distinct contributors</a> have authored more than 1,140 pull requests.</p>



<p>“Rook was born from the need for automated storage management in cloud native environments. Rather than plugging external storage solutions into Kubernetes, we recognized that a storage platform was needed within a Kubernetes cluster,” said Travis Nielsen, Rook maintainer and senior principal software engineer at Red Hat. “We are very proud of this graduation that recognizes the maturity of the project and our dedication to quality, security, and reliability in production!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In 2018, when we donated Rook to CNCF, there was strong interest and community around Kubernetes and a need for automated storage management for the cloud native community. It was important to make sure that Rook remained free and community-driven to continue to drive innovation for the broader ecosystem,” said Jared Watts, co-founder of Rook and founding engineer at Upbound. “We’re proud of Rook’s thriving community, thanks to CNCF leadership and support, and look forward to pushing the ecosystem forward as a mature, production-ready cloud native storage solution.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOwrwYmBUpLUm6W5J5rhXvdVit818hWJ/view?usp=sharing">security audit</a> was performed by the CNCF Security SIG in December 2019, which resulted in 13 findings ranging from High to Low in severity, many of them common amongst open source projects. The Rook maintainers have taken steps to address these issues. The Security SIG reviewed the project and recommended to the TOC that the project should graduate with no substantive concerns regarding its architecture or health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We never lost a byte of data even though upgrading through the pre-GA releases and had an exceptional experience with the helpful Rook community,” said Christian Hüning, technical director at Finleap Connect. “It is running flawless and delivers us the performance and resilience we require for our most critical business applications.”</p>



<p>“These are air-gapped installs running critical software on Kubernetes,” said Marc Campbell, founder and CTO at Replicated. “We rely on Rook to manage Ceph so that we get highly-available, redistributable block and object store without having to build it ourselves.”</p>



<p>“We’re happy to see the maturity of the project as it has gone through the different phases within the CNCF ecosystem and its introduction of the various other backends that we could use in the future,” said Moh Ahmed, cloud infrastructure engineer at the Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks.</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project has achieved passing level criteria for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1724">CII Best Practices</a> and adopted its own <a href="https://github.com/rook/rook/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a> structure.</p>

<p>Apple is requesting that Telegram shut down three channels used in Belarus to expose the identities of individuals belonging to the Belarusian authoritarian regime that may be oppressing civilians. Apple’s concern is that revealing the identities of law enforcement individuals may give rise to further violence.</p>
<p>Telegram, however, would prefer to keep the channels open, but the company said that it feels it has no choice in the matter. These channels are a tool for Belarus’ citizens protesting the recently rigged presidential election, but, with a centralized entity like Apple calling the shots on its own App Store, there’s little the protesters can do about it, explains Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.</p>

<p>“I think this situation is not black and white and would rather leave the channels be, but typically Apple doesn’t offer much choice for apps like Telegram in such situations,” Durov wrote in his Telegram channel.</p>
<p>The tension between Apple and Telegram is part of the wider issue surrounding Belarus’ 2020 election, which saw incumbent Alexander Lukashenko re-elected despite claims and evidence the election was rigged. The result has seen thousands of Belarusian citizens take to the streets to protest.</p>
<p>This tension also highlights a problem with centralized app stores. “Unfortunately, I assume these channels will end up getting blocked on iOS, but remain available on other platforms,” Durov added.</p>

</small></p>

<p>For two decades now, I have been interested in sleep research due to my professional involvement in memory and learning. This e-book attempts to produce a synthesis of what is known about sleep with a view to practical applications, esp. in people who need top-quality sleep for their learning or creative achievements. Neurophysiology of sleep is an explosively growing branch of science. Many theories that are currently contested will soon be forgotten as a result of new findings. Consequently, this text is likely to grow old very quickly (compare old versions from <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">2000</a> and <a href="http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm">2012</a>). Still, some basic truths about sleep are well-established, and practical conclusions can be drawn with the benefit to human creativity and intellectual accomplishment. In this text, I provide some links to research papers and popular-scientific articles that advocate disparate and contradictory theories. Please consult other sources to be certain you do not to get a one-sided view! This text includes some indications on how to use <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a> in the treatment of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a>, advanced and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/DSPS" title="DSPS">delayed sleep phase syndromes</a>, and some other sleep disorders. If your own experience can contribute to the ideas presented herein, I will gladly <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">hear from you</a> (esp. in the context of learning and creativity).

<h2><span id="Dreams_of_good_sleep">Dreams of good sleep</span></h2>
<p>It is everyone's dream to wake up fresh, happy, and ready for action on a daily basis. Sadly, in the modern world, only a small minority lives that dream. Yet the dream is within reach for most healthy people given:
</p>
<ol><li> a bit of knowledge, and</li>
<li> a readiness to make some lifestyle sacrifice.</li></ol>
<p>I hope that this article compiles all the basic ingredients of knowledge that are helpful in accomplishing refreshing sleep. As for the sacrifice, it is important to begin with the understanding that one cannot eat one's cake and have it too. Healthy sleep may be incompatible with some modern habits, some cravings, or some lifestyle choices. At worst, refreshing sleep may be incompatible with one's job or even long-term goals. Due to the latter fact, this article cannot provide a solution for everyone. Moreover, having a happy and fresh mind on a daily basis is a difficult thing to accomplish even with the whole arsenal of scientific knowledge and a full focus on good sleep. However, let me state it emphatically:
</p>
<p><b>Good sleep on most nights is feasible for most people!</b></p>
<p>This article was originally written <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">a decade ago</a>. I have always been interested in memory, learning, and sleep. In addition, in my job, sleep is as important as oxygen. As we all move deeper into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_economy">Knowledge Economy</a>, the issues discussed herein will become more and more important for each of us. After writing the original article, I had the great pleasure of getting in touch with hundreds of people experiencing various sleep problems. I came to see first hand how knowledge of sleep helps solve their problems. I could also see how the industrialized age lays obstacles in one's quest for good sleep and high productivity. I have witnessed a true epidemic of sleep phase disorders, an explosion of interest in polyphasic sleep, and an exponential increase in interest in the matters of sleep in general. Despite my pleas, many people just cannot avoid using an alarm clock, running all-nighters before exams, waking their kids cranky for school, popping pills before sleep, leaving babies in their cots to <dfn id=""><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#cry_it_out_method" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"><span title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary § cry it out method">cry it out</span></a></dfn> for sleep, etc. The picture would be pretty sad and alarming were it not for the fact that there is hope in knowledge. With a degree of determination, everyone can improve his, her, or their kids' sleep.
</p><p>This article is a compilation of the most important and the most interesting things about the biology of sleep. It is supposed to help you gain knowledge needed to achieve high quality refreshing sleep that will boost your mental powers. The article explains why sleep is vitally important for health and for the brain. It argues that sleep deserves highest respect, and that most people could get excellent sleep if they only followed the prescribed rules.
</p><p>Since writing the original <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep2000.htm">Good sleep, good learning, good life</a>, tremendous progress has been made in the science of sleep. My own work with tools such as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SleepChart" title="SleepChart">SleepChart</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo" title="SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a> has shed some interesting light on the connection between sleep and learning. As I kept addressing the progress in sleep science in minor articles and FAQs, some visitors to <a href="http://super-memory.com/">super-memory.com</a> complained that valuable nuggets of information are dispersed throughout the site instead of being organized in a more encyclopedic manner in a single article. Here then comes a comprehensive compilation, in which I would like to retain the focus on practical knowledge that is helpful in achieving good sleep. However, I would still like to smuggle in some lesser known research findings that might be inspiring for an average reader and/or a scientist working in the fields of sleep, memory, and learning. If you believe I left out anything important that others should know, please <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">let me know</a>.
</p><p>As the article grew to be insanely long, you may wish to begin with the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Summary" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Summary">summary at the bottom of the article</a>. And if even that is too long, here are the highlights:
</p>
<ul><li> respect sleep as your tool for high IQ and good learning</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep" title="Free running sleep">free running sleep</a> can help you resolve many sleep problems</li>
<li> <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_sleep" title="Biphasic sleep">biphasic sleep</a> schedule is probably the healthiest schedule for creative people</li>
<li> do not wake up kids for school; if they cannot wake up in time, let them skip a class or two, or consider <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling">homeschooling</a></li>
<li> let babies and young children sleep on demand, co-sleeping is a great idea (even if many pediatricians will tell you otherwise)</li>
<li> exercise, learning, and sleep are your best tools for brain growth!</li>
<li> avoid regulating sleep and alertness with substances, esp. sleeping pills, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_sleep" title="Effects of alcohol on sleep">alcohol</a>, illegal drugs, nicotine, and <dfn id=""><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep,_good_learning,_good_life:_Glossary#caffeine" title="Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary"><span title="See entry at: Good sleep, good learning, good life: Glossary § caffeine">caffeine</span></a></dfn></li></ul>
<h2><span id="Understanding_sleep">Understanding sleep</span></h2>
<p>Too few people realize how important sleep is! The alarm clock is an often-used fixture in an overwhelming majority of households of the modern world. By using electric lighting, alarm clocks, sleeping pills, and shift-work, we have wreaked havoc on the process of sleep.

</div>
<p>Over the last hundred years of the twentieth century, we have intruded upon a delicate and finely regulated process that was perfected by several hundred million years of evolution. Yet only recently have we truly become aware that this intrusion may belong to the most important preventable factors that are slowing societal growth in industrial nations! In a couple of years from now, we may look at alarm clocks and "sleep regulation" in the same way that we look today at other "great" human inventions in the league of cigarettes, asbestos materials, or radioactive cosmetics.
</p><p>Check this list below and see which applies to you:
</p>
<ul><li> I often have problems with falling asleep at the right time</li>
<li> I often find it painful to get up in the morning due to sleepiness</li>
<li> I am often awfully drowsy at school or at work</li>
<li> I regularly cut my sleep by 2-3 hours as compared with what my body seems to need</li>
<li> I use the alarm clock and truly hate it</li>
<li> I drink buckets of coffee or coke</li>
<li> I often take 2-4 hour naps in the evening</li>
<li> for me, at least one of the above is a source of regular stress or reduced productivity</li></ul>
<p>I bet that chances are around 90% you could subscribe to one of the above. Perhaps this is why you are reading this article. It is also highly likely you have already learned to accept the status quo, and you do not believe you can do much about it. This article may hint at some remedies. However, the bad news is that for a real solution you will probably need to change your family life, your work, your boss, or some social rules!
</p><p><b>Sleep isn't just a form of rest!</b> Sleep plays a critical physiological function, and is indispensable for your intellectual development! Those who do not respect their sleep are not likely to live to their full mental potential!
</p><p>Modern society has developed a set of well-entrenched rules that keep sleep in utmost disregard. This has been driven to pathological levels in American society. Here are some bad rules that hurt sleep:
</p>
<ul><li> it is ok to use an alarm clock to cut sleep short</li>
<li> it is ok to work in shifts</li>
<li> it is ok to travel people around the world without much attention to the jet lag problem</li>
<li> it is ok to save time by sleeping less and working more</li>
<li> it is ok to pull kids out of bed in time for school</li>
<li> it is ok to skip nights before important exams, etc.</li></ul>
<p>Cutting down on sleep does not make people die (<a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/If_you_do_not_sleep,_you_die!" title="If you do not sleep, you die!">at least not immediately</a>). It does make them feel miserable, but the ease with which we recover by getting just one good night of sleep seems to make sleep look cheap. Even the reports from the Guinness World Record attempt at sleeplessness (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Gardner_(record_holder)">Randy Gardner's</a> awakathon in 1964 lasted 11 days) trivialized the effects of sleeplessness. Many books on psychiatry and psychology still state that there aren't any significant side effects to prolonged sleeplessness! This is false! The Guinness Book of Records has since withdrawn its <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" title="Sleep deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> category due to the involved health risks.
</p><p>In 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president, he proudly admitted that he went 48 hours without sleep because he really wanted to become the next president. Former Senator Bob Dole "improved" the record in 1996 presidential campaign: <i>We have been going 78 hours. We've got to go 96. We have been going around the clock for America.</i> Dole's feat was matched by Vice President Albert Gore Jr., who kept campaigning for three days before the election day of November 7, 2000. After the election, Gore still kept on his feet by going into extra hours of the concede-retract cycle of his cliffhanger contest against Governor George W. Bush of Texas. When Barack Obama was asked about his most …</p></div></div>

October 9, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/loading-csv-file-at-the-speed-limit-of-the-nvme-storage/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/loading-csv-file-at-the-speed-limit-of-the-nvme-storage/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>I plan to write a series of articles to discuss some simple but not embarrassingly parallel algorithms. These will have practical usages and would most likely be on many-core CPUs or CUDA GPUs. Today’s is the first one to discuss a parallel algorithm implementation for CSV file parser.</em></p>

<p>In the old days, when our spin disk speed maxed out at 100MiB/s, we only have two choices: either we don’t care about the file loading time at all, treating it as a cost of life, or we have a file format entangled with the underlying memory representation to squeeze out the last bits of performance for data loading.</p>

<p>That world has long gone. My current workstation uses a software RAID0 (mdadm) over two 1TB Samsung 970 EVO NVMe storage for data storage. This setup usually gives me around 2GiB/s read / write speed (you can read more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3JYEIsjH8">about my workstation here</a>).</p>

<p>The CSV file format is firmly in the former category of the two. The thing that people who exchange CSV files care most, above anything else, is the interoperability. Serious people who actually care about speed and efficiency moved to other formats such as <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> or <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>. But CSV files live on. It is still by far the most common format in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/docs/datasets">Kaggle</a> contests.</p>

<p>There exist many implementations for CSV file parsers. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/p-ranav/csv2">csv2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-parser">Vince’s CSV Parser</a> would be two common implementations. That doesn’t account for standard implementations such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">the one from Python</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these implementations shy away from utilizing many-cores. It is a reasonable choice. In many likely scenarios, you would load many small-ish CSV files, and these can be done in parallel at task-level. That is an OK choice until recently, when I have to deal with some many GiBs CSV files. These files can take many seconds to load, even from tmpfs. That indicates a performance bottleneck at CPU parsing time.</p>

<p>The most obvious way to overcome the CPU parsing bottleneck is to fully utilize the 32 cores of Threadripper 3970x. This can be embarrassingly simple if we can reliably breakdown the parsing by rows. Unfortunately, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> prevents us from simply using line breaks as row delimiters. Particularly, when quoted, a cell content can contain line breaks and these will not be recognized as row delimiters.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wiseio/paratext">Paratext</a> first implemented a two-pass approach for parallel CSV parsing. Later it is documented in <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/chunker-sigmod19.pdf">Speculative Distributed CSV Data Parsing for Big Data Analytics</a></em>. The paper discussed, besides the two-pass approach, a more sophisticated speculative approach that is suitable for the higher-latency distributed environment.</p>

<p>In the past few days, I implemented a variant of the two-pass approach that can max out the NVMe storage bandwidth. It is an interesting journey as I didn’t write any serious parser in C for a very long time.</p>

<h3 id="the-csv-file-parsing-problem">The CSV File Parsing Problem</h3>

<p>CSV file represents simple tabular data with rows and columns. Thus, to parse a CSV file, it is meant to divide a text file into cells that can be uniquely identified with row and column index.</p>

<p>In C++, this can be done in zero-copy fashion with <code>string_view</code>. In C, every string has to be null-terminated. Thus, you need to either manipulate the original buffer, or copy it over. I elected the latter.</p>

<h3 id="memory-mapped-file">Memory-Mapped File</h3>

<p>To simplify the parser implementation, it is assumed we are given a block of memory that is the content of the CSV file. This can be done in C with:</p>

<h3 id="openmp">OpenMP</h3>

<p>We are going to use <a href="https://openmp.llvm.org/">OpenMP</a>’s parallel for-loop to implement the core algorithm. Nowadays, Clang has pretty comprehensive support for OpenMP. But nevertheless, we will only use the very trivial part of what OpenMP provides.</p>

<h3 id="find-the-right-line-breaks">Find the Right Line Breaks</h3>

<p>To parallel parse a CSV file, we first need to break it down into chunks. We can divide the file into 1MiB sequence of bytes as our chunks. Within each chunk, we can start to find the right line breaks.</p>

<p>The double-quote in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180.html">RFC 4180</a> can quote a line break, that makes us find the right line breaks harder. But at the same time, the RFC defines the way to <em>escape</em> double-quote by using two double-quote back-to-back. With this, if we count double-quotes from the beginning of a file, we know that a line break is within a quoted cell if we encounter an odd number of double-quotes so far. If we encounter an even number of double-quotes before a line break, we know that is a beginning of a new row.</p>

<p>We can count double-quotes from the beginning of each chunk. However, because we don’t know if there are an odd or even number of double-quotes before this chunk, we cannot differentiate whether a line break is the starting point of a new row, or just within a quoted cell. What we do know, though, is that a line break after an odd number of double-quotes within a chunk is the same class of line breaks. We simply don’t know at that point which class that is. We can count these two classes separately.</p>

<p>A code excerpt would look like this:</p>

<p>This is our first pass.</p>

<h3 id="columns-and-rows">Columns and Rows</h3>

<p>After the first pass, we can sequentially go through each chunk’s statistics to calculate how many rows and columns in the given CSV file.</p>

<p>The line breaks in the first chunk after even number of double-quotes would be the number of rows in the first chunk. Because we know the number of double-quotes in the first chunk, we now know what class of line breaks in the second chunk are the start points of a row. The sum of these line breaks would be the number of rows.</p>

<p>For the number of columns, we can go through the first row and count the number of column delimiters outside of double-quotes.</p>

<h3 id="wiring-the-cell-strings">Wiring the Cell Strings</h3>

<p>The second pass will copy the chunks over, null-terminate each cell, escape the double-quotes if possible. We can piggyback our logic on top of the chunks allocated for the first pass. However, unlike the first pass, the parsing logic doesn’t start at the very beginning of each chunk. It starts at the first starting point of a row in that chunk and ends at the first starting point of a row in the next chunk.</p>

<p>The second pass turns out to occupy the most of our parsing time, simply because it does most of the string manipulations and copying in this pass.</p>

<h3 id="more-optimizations">More Optimizations</h3>

<p>Both the first pass and second pass unrolled into 8-byte batch parsing, rather than per-byte parsing. For the second pass, we did some bit-twiddling to quickly check whether there are delimiters, double-quotes, or line breaks that needed to be processed, or we can simply copy it over.</p>

<p>The above performance accounts for the best you can get if file IO is not a concern. With the said 970 EVO RAID0, we can run another round of benchmark against the real disk IO.

<b></b><p><b>Abstract</b>. Lamport showed that a replicated deterministic state machine is a general way to implement a highly available system, given a consensus algorithm that the replicas can use to agree on each input. His Paxos algorithm is the most fault-tolerant way to get consensus without real-time guarantees. Because general consensus is expensive, practical systems reserve it for emergencies and use leases (locks that time out) for most of the computing. This paper explains the general scheme for efficient highly available computing, gives a general method for understanding concurrent and fault-tolerant programs, and derives the Paxos algorithm as an example of the method.</p>
<b><span size="4"><p>1. Introduction</p>
</span></b><p>A system is available if it provides service promptly on demand. The only way to make a highly available system out of less available components is to use redundancy, so the system can work even when some of its parts are broken. The simplest kind of redundancy is replication: make several copies or ‘replicas’ of each part.</p>
<p>This paper explains how to build efficient highly available systems out of replicas, and it gives a careful specification and an informal correctness proof for the key algorithm. Nearly all of the ideas are due to Leslie Lamport: replicated state machines [5], the Paxos consensus algorithm [7], and the methods of specifying and analyzing concurrent systems [6]. I wrote the paper because after I had read Lamport’s papers, it still took me a long time to understand these methods and how to use them effectively. Surprisingly few people seem to know about them in spite of their elegance and power. </p>
<p>In the next section we explain how to build a replicated state machine that is both efficient and highly available, given a fault-tolerant algorithm for consensus. Section 3 gives some background on the consensus problem and its applications. Section 4 reviews the method we use for writing specifications and uses it to give a precise specification for consensus in several forms. In section 5 we introduce the basic idea behind the Paxos algorithm for consensus and derive the algorithm from this idea and the specification. Finally we explain some important optimizations and summarize our conclusions. </p>
<b><span size="4"><p>2. Replicated State Machines</p>
</span></b><p>Redundancy is not enough; to be useful it must be coordinated. The simplest way to do this is to make each non-faulty replica do the same thing. Then any non-faulty replica can provide the outputs; if the replicas are not fail-stop, requiring the same output from f replicas will tolerate f – 1 faults. More complicated kinds of redundancy (such as error-correcting codes) are cheaper, but they depend on special properties of the service being provided.</p>
<p>In this section we explain how to coordinate the replicas in a fully general and highly fault tolerant way. Then we explore an optimization called ‘leases’ that makes the coordination very efficient in nearly all cases.</p>
<b><p>2.1 Coordinating the Replicas</p>
</b><p>How can we arrange for each replica to do the same thing? Adopting a scheme first proposed by Lamport [5], we build each replica as a deterministic state machine; this means that the transition relation is a function from (state, input) to (new state, output). It is customary to call one of these replicas a ‘process’. Several processes that start in the same state and see the same sequence of inputs will do the same thing, that is, end up in the same state and produce the same outputs. So all we need for high availability is to ensure that all the non-faulty processes see the same inputs. The technical term for this is ‘consensus’ (sometimes called ‘agreement’ or ‘reliable broadcast’). Informally, we say that several processes achieve consensus if they all agree on some value; we give a formal definition later on.</p>
<p>So if several processes are implementing the same deterministic state machine and achieve consensus on the values and order of the inputs, they will do the same thing. In this way it’s possible to replicate an arbitrary computation and thus make it highly available. Of course we can make the order a part of the input value by defining some total order on the set of inputs, for instance by numbering them 1, 2, 3, ... </p>
<p>In many applications the inputs are requests from clients to the replicated service. For example, a replicated storage service might have Read(a) and Write(a, d) inputs, and an airplane flight control system might have ReadInstrument(i) and RaiseFlaps(d) inputs. Different clients usually generate their requests independently, so it’s necessary to agree not only on what the requests are, but also on the order in which to serve them. The simplest way to do this is to number them with consecutive integers, starting at 1. This is done in ‘primary copy’ replication, since it’s easy for one process (the primary) to assign consecutive numbers. So the storage service will agree on Input 1 = Write(x, 3) and Input 2 = Read(x).</p>
<p>There are many other schemes for achieving consensus on the order of requests when their total order is not derived from consecutive integers; see Schneider’s survey [11]. These schemes label each input with some value from a totally ordered set (for instance, (client UID, timestamp) pairs) and then devise a way to be certain that you have seen all the inputs that can ever exist with labels smaller than a given value. This is complicated, and practical systems usually use a primary to sequence the inputs instead.</p>
<b><p>2.2 Leases: Efficient Highly Available Computing</p>
</b><p>Fault-tolerant consensus is expensive. Exclusive access by a single process (also known as locking) is cheap, but it is not fault-tolerant—if a process fails while it is holding a lock, no one else can access the resource. Adding a timeout to a lock makes a fault-tolerant lock or ‘lease’. Thus a process holds a lease on a state component or ‘resource’ until an expiration time; we say that the process is the ‘master’ for the resource while it holds the lease. No other process will touch the resource until the lease expires. For this to work, of course, the processes must have synchronized clocks. More precisely, if the maximum skew between the clocks of two processes is e and process P’s lease expires at time t, then P knows that no other process will touch the resource before time t – e on P’s clock.</p>
<p>While it holds the lease the master can read and write the resource freely. Writes must take bounded time, so that they can be guaranteed either to fail or to precede any operation that starts after the lease expires; this can be a serious problem for a resource such as a SCSI disk, which has weak ordering guarantees and a long upper bound on the time a write can take.</p>
<p>Locks in transaction processing systems are usually leases; if they expire the transaction is aborted, which means that its writes are undone and the transaction is equivalent to skip. A process that uses leases outside the scope of a transaction must take care to provide whatever atomicity is necessary, for example, by ensuring that the resource is in a good state after every atomic write (this is called ‘careful writes’), or by using standard redo or undo methods based on logs [4]. The latter is almost certainly necessary if the resource being leased is itself replicated.</p>
<p>A process can keep control of a resource by renewing its lease before it expires. It can also release its lease, perhaps on demand. If you can’t talk to the process that holds the lease, however (perhaps because it has failed), you have to wait for the lease to expire before touching its resource. So there is a tradeoff between the cost of renewing a lease and the time you have to wait for the lease to expire after a (possible) failure. A short lease means a short wait during recovery but a higher cost to renew the lease. A long lease means a long wait during recovery but a lower cost to renew.</p>
<p>A lease is most often used to give a process the right to cache some part of the state, for instance the contents of a cache line or of a file, knowing that it can’t change. Since a lease is a kind of lock, it can have a ‘mode’ which determines what operations its holder can do. If the lease is exclusive, then its process can change the leased state freely. This is like ‘owner’ access to a cache line or ownership of a multi-ported disk.</p>
<b><p>2.3 Hierarchical Leases</p>
</b><p>In a fault-tolerant system leases must be granted and renewed by running consensus. If this much use of consensus is still too expensive, the solution is hierarchical leases. Run consensus once to elect a czar <i>C</i> and give <i>C</i> a lease on a large part of the state. Now <i>C</i> gives out sub-leases on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> to masters. Each master controls its own resources. The masters renew their sub-leases with the czar. This is cheap since it doesn’t require any coordination. The czar renews its lease by consensus. This costs more, but there’s only one czar lease. Also, the czar can be simple and less likely to fail, so a longer lease may be acceptable. </p>
<p>Hierarchical leases are commonly used in replicated file systems and in clusters.</p>
<p>By combining the ideas of consensus, leases, and hierarchy, it’s possible to build highly available systems that are also highly efficient.</p>

		<p>One fairly common complaint about postgres is that is that each connection uses
too much memory. Often made when comparing postgres' connection model to one
where each connection is assigned a dedicated thread, instead of the current
model where each connection has a dedicated process.</p>
<p>To be clear: This is a worthwhile discussion to have. And there are several
important improvements we could make to reduce memory usage.</p>
<p>That said, I think one common cause of these concerns is that the easy ways to
measure the memory usage of a postgres backend, like <code>top</code> and <code>ps</code>, are quite
misleading.</p>
<p>It is surprisingly hard to accurately measure the increase in memory usage by
an additional connection.</p>
<p>In this post I’m mostly going to talk about running Postgres on Linux, since
that is what I have the most experience with.</p>
<p>My bold claim is that, <strong>when measuring accurately</strong>, a <strong>connection only has
an overhead of less than 2MiB</strong> (see <a href="#conclusion">conclusion</a>).</p>
<h2 id="a-first-look">A first look</h2>
<p>Just using the common operating system tools make the overhead look much bigger
than it actually is. Especially when not utilizing
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS">huge_pages</a>
(not recommended), the memory usage for each process will look high.</p>
<p>Let’s first look at a freshly established connection, in a freshly started
postgres cluster:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">andres@awork3:~$ psql
postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT pg_backend_pid();</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ pg_backend_pid │
├────────────────┤
│        <span>2003213</span> │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

andres@awork3:~/src/postgresql$ ps -q <span>2003213</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>2003213</span> <span>16944</span>
</code></pre></div><p>About 16MiB.</p>
<h2 id="massive-leaks-luckily-not">Massive leaks!?! Luckily not.</h2>
<p>What’s worse, the memory usage will appear to grow over time. To show this
problem, I’ll use the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgprewarm.html">pgprewarm</a>
extension to load all pages in a table into postgres' buffer pool:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SHOW shared_buffers ;</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ shared_buffers │
├────────────────┤
│ 16GB           │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT SUM(pg_prewarm(oid, 'buffer')) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
┌────────┐
│  sum   │
├────────┤
│ <span>383341</span> │
└────────┘

andres@awork3:~$ ps -q <span>2003213</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>2003213</span> <span>3169144</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now postgres memory usage appears to be around 3GB. Even though the individual
connection did not actually allocate much additional memory. The added memory
usage is proportional to the amount of shared buffers touched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>2003213<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_relation_size(oid))) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
┌────────────────┐
│ pg_size_pretty │
├────────────────┤
│ <span>2995</span> MB        │
└────────────────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And even worse than that, if yet another connection also uses those pages, it
will also show as having a huge memory usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>3244960<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT sum(abalance) FROM pgbench_accounts ;</span>
┌─────┐
│ sum │
├─────┤
│   <span>0</span> │
└─────┘
<span>(</span><span>1</span> row<span>)</span>

andres@awork3:~/src/postgresql$ ps -q <span>3244960</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3244960</span> <span>2700372</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Of course postgres does not actually use 3+2.7 GiB of memory in this
case. Instead, what is happening is that, with <code>huge_pages=off</code> off, ps will
attribute the amount of shared memory, including the buffer pool, that a
connection has utilized for each connection. Obviously leading to vastly
over-estimating memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="huge-pages-accidentally-kind-of-save-the-day">Huge pages accidentally kind of save the day</h2>
<p>Many CPU micro-architectures normally use a page size of 4KiB, but also
optionally can use larger page sizes, most commonly 2MiB.</p>
<p>Depending on operating system, configuration, and the type of applications used
such larger pages can be utilized transparently by the operating system, or
explicitly by applications. See e.g.
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Hugepages">Debian wiki page about huge pages</a> for some
details.</p>
<p>Repeating the previous experiments with <code>huge_pages=on</code> makes them look a lot
better. First, looking at a “new connection”:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">andres@awork3:~$ ps -q <span>3245907</span> -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3245907</span>  <span>7612</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, a new connection now appears to use only about ~7MiB. This reduction in
memory usage is caused by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table">page table</a>
needing less memory, as it now only needs to contain <code>1/512</code>th of the previous
entries, due to the larger page size.</p>
<p>And more importantly, the test where a lot of the memory is accessed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">postgres<span>[</span>3245843<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># ;SELECT SUM(pg_prewarm(oid, 'buffer')) FROM pg_class WHERE relfilenode &lt;&gt; 0;</span>
…
postgres<span>[</span>3245851<span>][</span>1<span>]=</span><span># SELECT sum(abalance) FROM pgbench_accounts ;</span>
…

andres@awork3:~$ ps -q 3245907,3245974 -eo pid,rss
    PID   RSS
<span>3245907</span> <span>12260</span>
<span>3245974</span>  <span>8936</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In contrast to above, these connections now appear to only use 12MiB and 9MiB
respectively, where previously they used 3GiB and 2.7GiB. Quite the apparent
change ;)</p>
<p>This is due to the way the use of larger pages is implemented in Linux, not
because we used orders of magnitude less memory: huge pages used just aren’t
shown as part of the <code>RSS</code> column of ps/top.</p>
<h2 id="getting-less-unreal">Getting less unreal</h2>
<p>Since Linux 4.5 the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=rssanon"><code>/proc/$pid/status</code></a>
file shows the memory usage split into finer sub-categories:</p>
<pre><code>VmRSS		size of memory portions. It contains the three following parts (VmRSS = RssAnon + RssFile + RssShmem)
RssAnon		size of resident anonymous memory
RssFile		size of resident file mappings
RssShmem	size of resident shmem memory (includes SysV shm, mapping of tmpfs and shared anonymous mappings)
</code></pre><p>Looking at these stats with <code>huge_pages=off</code>:</p>

the shared memory accesses.</p>

<p>Just adding up the memory usage of the non-shmem values still over-estimates
memory usage. There’s two main reasons:</p>
<p>First, it doesn’t actually make sense to include <code>RssFile</code> when measuring a
postgres backend’s memory usage - for postgres that overwhelmingly just are the
postgres binary and the shared libraries it uses (postgres does not <code>mmap()</code>
files). As nearly all of that is shared between all processes in the system,
it’s not a per-connection overhead.</p>
<p>Secondly, even just looking at <code>RssAnon</code> over-estimates memory usage.  The
reason for that is that ps measures the entire memory of the process, even
though the majority of a new connection’s overhead is shared between the user
connection and the supervisor process. This is because Linux does not copy all
memory when <code>fork()</code>ing a new process, instead it uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">Copy-on-write</a> to only copy pages
when modified.</p>
<p>There is no good way to accurately measure the memory usage of an individual
forked process, but since version 4.14 the Linux kernel at least provides an
approximation
(<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=493b0e9d945fa9dfe96be93ae41b4ca4b6fdb317">commit with description</a>)
in a process' <code>/proc/[pid]/smaps_rollup</code> file. <code>Pss</code> shows the “the process’
proportional share of this mapping” across all of a process' mappings (Search
linux’s documentation page for
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=smaps_rollup">smaps_rollup</a>
and
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=Pss">Pss</a>,
which unfortunately does not have direct links). For memory shared between
processes it will divide the memory usage by the number of processes using a
mapping.</p>

<p>Challenged to write about a single Unicode character, I chose the humble asterisk. In this post, Julia takes a back seat but it’s working hard behind the scenes. <sup id="fnref:Franklin1"><a href="#fndef:Franklin1">[1]</a></sup> The font used for the examples is JuliaMono.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The asterisk has a long history. The first appearance of this simple mark was probably on a cave wall somewhere, but we like to assign inventions to known individuals, so the inventor of the asterisk was: Aristarchus of Samothrace, in about 200 BCE.</p>
<p>I was disappointed that this wasn’t the other Aristarchus, Aristarchus of Samos, the famous mathematician with an interest in astronomy, because ἀστερίσκος means “little star”. The man from Samothrace howrver was a librarian, scholar, critic, and proofreader, who liked to make numerous marks (*) in the margin of texts and manuscripts, like notes, queries, and critical comments.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2a-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>* Like this.</p>
<p>As well as writing little stars in the margin he also used other marks, such as the one we now call the reference mark (<code>\u203b</code>)*.</p>
<p>* Perhaps this was a refinement of the asterisk, or perhaps it came first. They look quite similar...</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-203b-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>This use of the asterisk and related marks has continued right up to the present day. Medieval scribes and scholars used a range of symbols to indicate their marginal annotations, and these continued as the printing revolution superseded hand-written manuscripts. Marginal notes were often replaced by footnotes, and the asterisk and dagger were the primary two symbols used for indicating these.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2a_2020-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>Another name for the dagger was the obelisk, hence the comic book characters Asterix and Obelix (which are probably familiar to you if you grew up in Europe).</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/asterix.jpeg" alt="asterix and obelisk"></p>
<p>If you’re writing a book, you can re-use these two indicators on every page, but if you want more than two footnotes on the same page, you have to reach into some of the less rarely seen marks, such as the double dagger (a ‘diesis’); the triple dagger; the section sign; the pilcrow; the ‘parallel to’; and the asterism.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-2021_2e4b_a7_b6_2225_2042-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>Medieval scribes, and readers who enjoy writing in the margins of books, can get carried away with the possibilities. The pointing hand or manicule* is also seen in the margins of manuscripts, and adds some human interest to the dullest of scriptural documents.</p>
<div><p>* also called the printers’ fist</p>
<p>☜</p></div>
<p>If you run out of symbols, you might have to start doubling up on them. A heavily-footnoted page could work through the following:</p>

It could be time to switch to numbered footnotes, numbered from 1 to n for the whole chapter rather than starting at 1 on each page. These days, we can leave it to the software (such as \( \LaTeX \) or, for this web page, Franklin <sup id="fnref:Franklin2"><a href="#fndef:Franklin2">[2]</a></sup>) to do that for us.</p>

<p>To this day, the word “asterisk” carries with it a few additional meanings derived from its history as a pointer to important additional content. It’s used in advertising, to indicate the presence of small print which you should probably read - but perhaps they hope you don’t. In American journalism, often dominated by sport and politics, the word “asterisk” has come to mean “no, you’d better read more about this before you decide what to think”. It was famously applied to George W Bush after his disputed “victory”* in the 2000 US presidential election, when the cartoonist Doonesbury started portraying Bush as a literal asterisk.</p>
<p>* Bush got fewer votes than Al Gore in Florida, but still won there.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/doonesbury.jpeg" alt="gw bush in doonesbury"></p>
<p>In baseball, there's always talk of <a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/06/27/roger-maris-and-the-myth-of-the-asterisk/">asterisks</a> set against players’ recorded achievements. According to the New York Times, the US Tennis Open this year (2020) should be called “The Asterisk Open”, because of the many players who couldn’t attend, and so the winner isn’t the best player.<sup id="fnref:tennis"><a href="#fndef:tennis">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Another famous bearer of the insinuating asterisk is drug-peddler and bike-pedaller Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/nyt-lance-armstrong-asterisk.png" alt="lance armstrong"></p>
<p>So the word itself has picked up a bit of a smell.</p>
<h2 id="asterisk_assessment"><a href="#asterisk_assessment">Asterisk assessment</a></h2>
<p>So far, this is the history of the asterisk as told in books and web pages. Keith Hou­s­ton’s excellent book <em>Shady Characters</em> <sup id="fnref:shady"><a href="#fndef:shady">[4]</a></sup> covers the history of most of the punctuation marks in great detail. But his chapter on the asterisk concentrates entirely on the asterisk’s use as a footnote indicator, and ends more or less here.</p>
<p>Today we're used to seeing it used for many more things than footnotes, such as multiplication. In mathematics, various symbols have been used for multiplication, although the default operation is multiplication: for mathematicians, if you place two symbols in intimate contact, they’ll naturally multiply without needing any help from a third symbol.</p>
<p>The Julia language allows for implicit multiplication between numbers and variables:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt;

julia&gt; x = 2
2

julia&gt; 2x
4</code></pre>
<p>although Python doesn’t:</p>
<pre><code>% python
Python 3.8.1 (default, Mar  8 2020, 13:39:36)
[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2x
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
2x
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Most languages use <code>*</code> for multiplication. Mathematica* is more capable than most. Spaces denote multiplication, but you can also use a <code>*</code> for multiplication if you want to.</p>
<p>* probably renamed to the Wolfram Language since I last used it</p>
<p>Let's go back in time again, to see how the asterisk started this journey.</p>
<h2 id="galileo_galileo"><a href="#galileo_galileo">Galileo Galileo</a></h2>
<p>Up to the 1600s, the asterisk was used mainly for footnotes and decorative purposes in scientific books. For example, it finds its astronomical roots in the famous publication by Galileo, <em>Sidereus Nuncius</em>, the Sidereal (Starry) Message, printed in 1610.</p>
<p>These asterisks show what Galileo called the Medicean Stars, which we now call the Galilean Moons, orbiting Jupiter.*</p>
<p>* It looks like the typesetter is using the same “O” to represent Jupiter here that was used on the title page for “GalileO GalileO” and “COsmO Medici”. The asterisk ‘plot markers’ do the job perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/sidereal-messenger.png" alt="Galileo sidereal message"></p>
<h2 id="symbols"><a href="#symbols">Symbols</a></h2>
<p>Science, and mathematics, the language of science, had gradually developed from medieval manuscripts written in elaborate Latin sentences to printed books embroidered with algebraic symbols. Mathematics moved away from the wordy descriptive approach to a more algebraic style.*</p>
<p>* This always wasn’t an unopposed process. It's been called “The struggle between symbolists and rhetoricians”. <sup id="fnref:Florian"><a href="#fndef:Florian">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>From the 1500s on, various authors enthusiastically promoted new syntax and probably hoped that their favourite symbols would take hold and become standard. No doubt the printers of mathematical books were happy to add the cost of designing, punch-cutting, and hot-lead-moulding all those extra new pieces of type to the final invoice.*</p>
<p>* Perhaps these days it’s not that much easier to add new symbols to a font.</p>
<p>In 1668, the Swiss author Johan Heinrich Rahn was the first to introduce the asterisk to indicate multiplication, in his algebraic treatise <em>Teutsche Algebra</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/rahn-multiply.png" alt="rahn"></p>
<p>That spiral character denotes ‘involution’ (an old word for exponentiation). His book also contains, on another page, the first printed use of the division symbol ÷.</p>
<p>Until recently, Rahn’s score had been: won 1, lost 1. The multiplying asterisk didn’t catch on at all at the time, although his division sign did.</p>
<h3 id="the_saltire"><a href="#the_saltire">The saltire</a></h3>
<p>Earlier, in 1631, William Oughtred<sup id="fnref:Oughtred"><a href="#fndef:Oughtred">[6]</a></sup>* had published the <em>Clavis Mathematicae, The Key to Mathematics</em>, and this famous textbook, with its profusion of new symbols, was very influential and studied by many, including the young Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>* 1574 – 1660 • He was a clergyman, mathematician, teacher, inventor - he taught Christopher Wren, among others. He invented the slide rule and introduced the abbreviations “sin” and “cos” for the sine and cosine functions.</p>
<p>Oughtred’s book popularized the saltire, a rotated plus sign, for use as the visible multiplication symbol. Here’s the first time it appeared in print:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/oughtred-clavis.png" alt="oughtred"></p>
<p>In the hands of this typesetter, it’s quite small compared with the other operators. It wouldn't easily be confused with the usually seriff-ed letter X.</p>
<p>Here's ×, the times sign (<code>\u00d7</code>), and the saltire:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/unicodechar-d7_2613-tidy.svg" alt=""></p><p>* The saltire also goes by the name St Andrew’s Cross - who was crucified on a larger wooden version. In heraldry, it’s formed by ‘a bend and a bend sinister’.</p>
<p>Sadly, × doesn’t work as a multiplication sign in Julia, although it’s easy enough to make it work:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; const × = *
* (generic function with 385 methods)

julia&gt; x = 3 × 4
12

julia&gt; a = "hello" × "world" # ⁉
"helloworld"</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if there are any unexpected side effects when doing this.</p>
<h2 id="leibniz"><a href="#leibniz">Leibniz</a></h2>
<p>The influential mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz didn’t like Oughtred’s saltire symbol, and wrote to Bernoulli in 1698:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not like the <code>×</code> symbol as a symbol for multiplication, since it is easily confounded with <code>x</code>;&nbsp;… often I simply&nbsp;relate two quantities by an interposed dot and indicate multiplication with <code>ZC ⋅ LM</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The saltire probably found more favour in England than Germany. Newton adopted it, doubtless after seeing a need for it. Here’s the first edition of his Principia Mathematica<sup id="fnref:principia"><a href="#fndef:principia">[7]</a></sup>, published in 1687.</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/newton-principia-first.png" alt="newton principia first edition"></p>
<p>I’d say Leibniz definitely has a ‘point’ here, because Newton's used a lowercase <code>x</code> as a surrogate saltire, although to be fair he doesn't often use <code>x</code> as a variable. But in the revised 1723 edition, Newton improves most of his font choices*:</p>
<p><img src="https://cormullion.github.io/assets/images/asterisk/newton-principia-third.png" alt="newton principia third edition"></p>
<p>* That letter Q is eye-catching.</p>
<p>Now the saltire is much larger and, without the serifs used for most mathematical printing at the time, is less likely to be confused with an X of any size.</p>
<p>More so than Oughtred and Rahn, Leibniz was very influential: he popularized the dx/dy notation, the integration symbol, the multiplication dot, signs for congruence and similarity, and many more, and even used an asterisk for the occasional multiplication.</p>
<h3 id="too_useful"><a href="#too_useful">Too useful</a></h3>
<p>In general, though, the multiplying asterisk wasn’t often used in most mathematics (as opposed to arithmetical) texts, and was more likely to be used to indicate footnotes or for other more specialized uses. If multiplication was required, Leibniz’ dot was considered …</p></div></div>

          <h2>Status</h2>
          <p>The site is still under development. We believe we have most of the games written for the BBC Micro apart from a few very obscure ones which we are still trying to track down. If you know of a game we have missed, or even better if you own one, contact us in the forums and we will get it added to the database. We maintain a list of titles which we believe to be <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=14458">missing from the archive</a> in the forums. </p>
	  
          <h2>Ideology</h2>
          <p>We strive for ease of use rather than exact preservation of the original. Software has been transferred from tape to disc image, to speed loading. Changes have been made to enhance usability - see the <i>Who we are</i> section for more detail. Any major changes are noted on the game's page. </p>
	  
          <h2>Thanks</h2>
          <p>In addition to the people who worked on the archive and the website, we would like to give a big <strong>thank you</strong> to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MattGodbolt">Matt Godbolt</a> for developing <a href="http://bbc.godbolt.org/">jsbeeb</a>, and sharing it with the world on <a href="https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb">github</a>. It makes the website come alive - anyone can play the BBC Micro games right in the browser!</p>
	  
          <h2>Source</h2>
          <p>This web site is open source. and the <a href="https://github.com/pau1ie/bbcmicro.co.uk">source is on github</a>. Please feel free to take it and use it for your own website. We would be interested to hear what you have done with it in the forums. </p>

           <h2>Who we are</h2><p>
The games on this website, almost without exception, were originally curated by Mick Brown, who announced the "30th Anniversary BBC &amp; Electron Collection" in 2014 and started <a href="http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=8270">releasing disc images on the Stardot forum</a> in May of that year. 
</p><p>
The collection is made up of games that Mick had first copied to his own "unofficial" compilation discs thirty years before. 
</p><p>
Mick has enhanced the games by adding user-friendly instructions (taken from cassette inlays or other authentic sources) and ensuring that the games are compatible with a range of emulators as well as real Acorn hardware.
</p><p>
Our thanks go to Mick for the countless hours of work he has put into compiling, enhancing, testing, and re-testing the games in this collection.
</p><p>
Thanks also to Paul Houghton for developing the <a href="http://bbcmicro.co.uk//bbcmicro.co.uk">bbcmicro.co.uk</a> website, and to Gary for hosting it.
</p><p>
Lee "Eagle Eyes" Newsome proofread the game instructions, tested every game several times, and coordinated the work on the website project.
Huge thanks to Dave Moore (user Arcadian on Stardot) for his enduring commitment to preserving and promoting all things Acorn, online and off, including the creation of the invaluable <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com/">Stairway To Hell</a> archive. 
</p><p>
We're grateful to the incredibly knowledgeable members of the Stardot forum for their generous help and support.

<p><em>tldr: work has started to make <a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a> work as a backend in curl for HTTP.</em></p>



<p>curl and its data transfer core, libcurl, is all written in C. The language C is known and infamous for not being memory safe and for being easy to mess up and as a result accidentally cause security problems.</p>



<p>At the same time, C compilers are very widely used and available and you can compile C programs for virtually every operating system and CPU out there. A C program can be made far more portable than code written in just about any other programming language.</p>



<p>curl is a piece of “insecure” C code installed in some ten billion installations world-wide. I’m saying insecure within quotes because I don’t think curl is insecure. We have our share of security vulnerabilities of course, even if I think the rate of them getting found has been drastically reduced over the last few years, but we have never had a critical one and with the help of busloads of tools and humans we find and fix most issues in the code before they ever land in the hands of users. (And “memory safety” is not the single explanation for getting security issues.)</p>



<p>I believe that curl and libcurl will remain in wide use for a long time ahead: curl is an established component and companion in scripts and setups everywhere. libcurl is almost a de facto standard in places for doing internet transfers.</p>



<p>A rewrite of curl to another language is not considered. Porting an old, established and well-used code base such as libcurl, which to a far degree has gained its popularity and spread due to a stable API, not breaking the ABI and not changing behavior of existing functionality, is a massive and daunting task. To the degree that so far it hasn’t been attempted seriously and even giant corporations who have considered it, have <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/06/19/google-to-reimplement-curl-in-libcrurl/" data-type="post" data-id="12576">backpedaled such ideas</a>.</p>



<h2>Change, but not change</h2>



<p>This preface above might make it seem like we’re stuck with exactly what we have for as long as curl and libcurl are used. But fear not: things are more complicated, or perhaps brighter, than it first seems.</p>



<p>What’s important to users of libcurl needs to be kept intact. We keep the API, the ABI, the behavior and all the documented options and features remain. We also need to continuously add stuff and keep up with the world going forward.</p>



<p>But we can change the internals! <em>Refactor</em> as the kids say.</p>



<h2>Backends, backends, backends</h2>



<p>Already today, you can build libcurl to use different “backends” for TLS, SSH, name resolving, LDAP, IDN, GSSAPI and HTTP/3.</p>



<p>A “backend” in this context is a piece of code in curl that lets you use a particular solution, often involving a specific third party library, for a certain libcurl functionality. Using this setup you can, for example, opt to build libcurl with one or more out of <em>thirteen</em> different TLS libraries. You simply pick the one(s) you prefer when you build it. The libcurl API remains the same to users, it’s just that some features and functionality might differ a bit. The number of TLS backends is of course also fluid over time as we add support for more libraries in the future, or even drop support for old ones as they fade away.</p>



<p>When building curl, you can right now make it use up to <strong>33</strong> different third party libraries for different functions. Many of them of course mutually exclusive, so no single build can use all 33.</p>



<p>Said differently: you can improve your curl and libcurl binaries without changing any code, by simply rebuilding it to use another backend combination.</p>

No Hyper in this map yet…</figcaption></figure>



<h2>libcurl as a glorified switch</h2>



<p>With an extensive set of backends that use third party libraries, the job of libcurl to a large extent becomes to act as a switch between the provided stable external API and the particular third party library that does the heavy lifting.</p>



<p><strong>API &lt;=&gt; glue code in C &lt;=&gt; backend library</strong></p>



<p>libcurl as the rock, with a door and the entry rules written in stone. The backends can come and go, change and improve, but the applications outside the entrance won’t notice that. They get a stable API and ABI that they know and trust.</p>



<h2>Safe backends</h2>



<p>This setup provides a foundation and infrastructure to offer backends written in other languages as part of the package. As long as those libraries have APIs that are accessible to libcurl, libraries used by the backends can be written in any language – but since we’re talking about memory safety in this blog post the most obvious choices would probably be one of the modern and safe languages. For example <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png" alt="" width="204" height="204" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.png 500w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rust_programming_language_black_logo-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px"></a></figure></div>



<p>With a backend library written in Rust , libcurl would lean on such a component to do low level protocol work and presumably, by doing this it increases the chances of the implementations to be safe and secure.</p>



<p>Two of the already supported third party libraries in the world map image above are written in Rust: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche">quiche</a> and <a href="https://mesalink.io/">Mesalink</a>.</p>



<h2>Hyper as a backend for HTTP</h2>



<p><a href="https://hyper.rs/">Hyper</a> is a HTTP library written in Rust. It is meant to be fast, accurate and safe, and it supports both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" srcset="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt.png 640w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lets-encrypt-200x200.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></figure></div>



<p>As another step into this world of an ever-growing number of backends to libcurl, work has begun to make sure curl (<em>optionally</em>) can get built to use Hyper.</p>



<p>This work is gracefully funded by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/">ISRG</a>, perhaps mostly known as the organization behind <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. Thanks!</p>



<h2>Many challenges remain</h2>



<p>I want to emphasize that this is early days. We know what we want to do, we know basically how to do it but from there to actually getting it done and providing it in source code to the world is <em>a little bit of work</em> that hasn’t been done. I’m set out to do it.</p>



<p>Hyper didn’t have a C API, they’re <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2278">working on making one</a> so that C based applications such as curl can actually use it. I do my best at providing feedback from my point of view, but as I’m not really into Rust much I can’t assist much with the implementation parts there.</p>



<p>Once there’s an early/alpha version of the API to try out, I will first make sure curl can get built to use Hyper, and then start poking on the code to start using it.</p>



<p>In that work I expect me to have to go back to the API with questions, feedback and perhaps documentation suggestions. I also anticipate challenges in switching libcurl internals to using this. Mostly small ones, but possibly also larger ones.</p>



<p>I have created a git branch and make my work on this public and accessible early on to let everyone who wants to, to keep up with the development. A first milestone will be the ability to run a single curl test case (any test case) successfully – unmodified. The branch is here: <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper">https://github.com/curl/curl/tree/bagder/hyper</a> – beware that it will be rebased frequently.</p>



<p>There’s no deadline for this project and I don’t yet have any guesses as when there will be anything to test.</p>



<h2>Rust itself is not there yet</h2>



<p>This project is truly ground work for future developers to build upon as some of the issues dealt with in here should benefit others as well down the road. For example it immediately became obvious that Rust in general encourages to <em>abort</em> on out-of-memory issues, while this is a big <em>nono</em> when the code is used in a system library (such as curl).</p>



<p>I’m a bit vague on the details here because it’s not my expertise, but Rust itself <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2265#issuecomment-696915382">can’t even properly clean up its memory</a> and just returns error when it hits such a condition. Clearly something to fix before a libcurl with hyper could claim identical behavior and never to leak memory.</p>



<h2>By default?</h2>



<p>Will Hyper be used by default in a future curl build near you?</p>



<p>We’re going to work on the project to make that future <em>a possibility</em> with the mindset that it could benefit users.</p>



<p><strong>If</strong> it truly happens involve many different factors (for example maturity, feature set, memory footprint, performance, portability and on-disk footprint…) and in particular it will depend a lot on the people that build and ship the curl packages you use – which isn’t the curl project itself as we only ship source code. I’m thinking of Linux and operating system distributions etc.</p>



<p><strong>When </strong>it might happen we can’t tell yet as we’re still much too early in this process.</p>



<h2>Still a lot of C</h2>



<p>This is not converting curl to Rust.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t be fooled into believing that we are getting rid of C in curl by taking this step.</strong> With the introduction of a Hyper powered backend, we will certainly reduce the share of C code that is executed in a typical HTTP transfer by a measurable amount (for those builds), but curl is much more than that.</p>



<p>It’s not even a given that the Hyper backend will “win” the competition for users against the C implementation on the platforms you care about. The future is not set.</p>



<h2>More backends in safe languages?</h2>



<p>Sure, why not? There are efforts to provide more backends written in Rust. Gradually, we might move into a future where less and less of the final curl and libcurl executable code was compiled from C.</p>



<p>How and if that will happen will of course depend on a lot of factors – in particular funding of the necessary work.</p>



<p>Can we drive the development in this direction even further? I think it is much too early to speculate on that. Let’s first see how these first few episodes into the coming decades turn out.</p>

<h5>2018-02-15 - By Robert Elder</h5>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is to discuss the works of computer programmer Jim Roskind. &nbsp;Specifically, his work related to the C/C++ programming languages will be emphasized. &nbsp;I became motivated to do this short write-up when I realized that a lot of his work on C/C++ programming was done in the 1990-1996 era, just after digital communication formats became popular, but just before 'blog' type documentation format became popular. &nbsp;As a result, a number of references to his works are becoming dead links, or are simply lacking any context somewhere in a decaying ftp site that nobody knows about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is unlikely to be interesting to anyone with a casual interest in C programming, but it is instead intended for individuals looking to develop an extremely intimate understanding of the C/C++ programming languages and their histories. &nbsp;My interest in reviewing Roskind's work has been to look for compiler test cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, I'll discuss a bit about the man himself:  &nbsp;As far as I can tell in my Googling, and assuming that I haven't confused multiple people with the same name, he was an independent consultant around 1990[1], was a co-founder of Infoseek Corporation[2][3] in 1994, joined Netscape in 1995[2], appeared in the popular documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m52s">Project Code Rush</a> around 1998, joined Google in 2008 and designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> in 2012. &nbsp;He has a number of other technical accomplishments that I haven't listed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of contributions to C programming, here are a couple files from around 1990 that are particularly worth mentioning:</p>

<p><code><pre>c++grammar1.1.tar.Z
c++grammar2.0.tar.Z
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you're reading this in the future and various links to these files may no longer be working, below are various hashes of these files. &nbsp;If you are lucky, searching for them might hopefully lead you to a mirror somewhere (at the moment they don't). &nbsp;I also checked for different sources of these files, and although I can find lots of references, I could only find a single mirror where I could download them:</p>

</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after checking the license of these files, I think it should be fine to mirror them myself too:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/assets/c%2B%2Bgrammar1.1.tar.Z">c++grammar1.1.tar.Z</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/assets/c%2B%2Bgrammar2.0.tar.Z">c++grammar2.0.tar.Z</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The c++grammar1.1.tar.Z document appears to simply be an earlier version of the c++grammar2.0.tar.Z version. &nbsp;Inside the c++grammar2.0.tar.Z version, you will find the following files (according to freegrm5.txt):</p>

<ul>
<li>FREEGRM5.TXT - This introductory file</li>
<li>GRAMMAR5.TXT - Parsing ambiguities in C++, and in my grammar</li>
<li>CPP5.Y - My YACC compatible C++ grammar</li>

<li>AUTODOC5.TXT - Documentationfor my machine generated analysis</li>
<li>Y.OUTPUT - Machine generated analysis of the C++ grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word 'my' as used in the above list should be interpreted to refer to Jim Roskind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might question what the purpose is of digging up ancient grammars for YACC now that gcc and clang have moved on from this paradigm, but for me this information is still useful. &nbsp;The detailed analysis provided by Roskind is a good source for developing compiler test cases and learning how the language evolved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there were a few discussions made on comp.compilers in the early 90s by Roskind that, at first glance, might seem like any other un-noteworthy piece of commentary in technical discussion forum, but they are in fact widely cited because they are the only time anyone has ever discussed the issue. &nbsp;One that I found very useful was <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/l/c/roskind.html">Jim Roskind on C ambiguity</a>. &nbsp;The post was useful because of several very special corner cases involving typedefs that it illustrates. &nbsp;In case that link goes dead, here is another reference to the general email thread on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.compilers/gqeQy3mXqnA">Google Groups comp.compilers</a>. &nbsp;And to back up my claim about citations, that post by Roskind is cited in <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01633123/document">"A Simple, Possibly Correct LR Parser for C11", Jacques-Henri Jourdan, FranÃ§ois Pottier</a>, among a number of other places.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you end up browsing the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack">The Lexer Hack</a>, you might notice that the first reference in the article is a source of Jim Roskind. &nbsp;Unfortunately, as of today, the reference is a dead link! &nbsp;But if you pay attention, you'll note that the link references a file called 'grammar5.txt' with a date of 1991-07-11, and this is exactly the date inside the 'grammar5.txt' that you can find in the tar file mentioned above!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure, but I believe the actual use of the term 'lexer hack' might actually be a reference specifically to <em>Jim Roskind's</em> lexer hack. &nbsp;Inside of grammar5.txt, there is a note: &nbsp;"I will refer to this feedback loop (from the parser that stores information in  a  symbol  table,  wherein  the lexer extracts the information) as the "lex hack"." &nbsp;That sounds to me like he came up with the term first!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if it piques your interest, here is the table of contents listed in grammar5.txt:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've read up until this point, you should be sold on the value of this information, either for historical purposes, or for the investigation into grammar ambiguities into the C or C++ languages. &nbsp;There are a number of other useful posts made by Jim Roskind on the comp.compilers newsgroup back in the 90s, but I won't go to the effort of listing them here. &nbsp;You'll just have to hope that those pages don't go dead before you try to search for the content on them.</p>

<p>This week, we continue our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, IVa, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week, we looked at how a blacksmith reshapes our iron from a spongy mass called a bloom first into a more workable shape and then finally into some final useful object like a tool.  But as we noted last week, the blacksmith doesn’t just need to manage the shape of the iron, but also its hardness and ductility.</p>



<p>As we’ll see this week, those factors – hardness and ductility (and a bunch of other more complex characteristics of metals which we’re going to leave out for simplicity’s sake) – can be manipulated by changing the chemical composition of the metal itself by <em>alloying</em> the iron with another element, carbon.  And because writing this post has run long and time has run short, <em>next</em> week, we’ll finish up by looking at how those same factors also respond to mechanical effects (work hardening) and heat treatment.</p>

<h2>What Is Steel?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the absolute basics: <em>what is steel</em>?  Fundamentally, <strong>steel is an alloy of iron and carbon</strong>.  We can, for the most part, dispense with many modern varieties of steel that involve more complex alloys; things like stainless steel (which add chromium to the mix) were unknown to pre-modern smiths and produced only by accident.  Natural alloys of this sort (particularly with manganese) might have been produced by accident where local ores had trace amounts of other metals.  This may have led to the common belief among ancient and medieval writers that iron from certain areas was superior to others (steel from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum">Noricum </a>in the Roman period, for instance, had this reputation, note Buchwald, <em>op. cit.</em> for the evidence of this), though I have not seen this proved with chemical studies.</p>



<p>So we are going to limit ourselves here to just carbon and iron.  Now in video-game logic, that means you take one ‘unit’ of carbon and one ‘unit’ of iron and bash them together in a fire to make steel.  As we’ll see, the process is at least moderately more complicated than that.  But more to the point: <strong>those proportions are totally wrong</strong>.  Steel is a combination of iron and carbon, <em>but not equal parts or anything close to it</em>.  Instead, the general division goes this way (there are several classification systems but they all have the same general grades):</p>



<p>Below 0.05% carbon or so, we just refer to that as iron.  There is going to be some small amount of carbon in most iron objects, picked up in the smelting or forging process.<br>From 0.05% carbon to 0.25% carbon is mild or low carbon steel.<br>From about 0.3% to about 0.6%, we might call medium carbon steel, although I see this classification only infrequently.<br>From <strong>0.6% to around 1.25%</strong> carbon is <em>high-carbon steel</em>, also known as <strong>spring steel</strong>.  For most armor, weapons and tools, this is the ‘good stuff’ (but see below on pattern welding).<br>From <strong>1.25% to 2%</strong> are ‘ultra-high-carbon steels’ which, as far as I can tell didn’t see much use in the ancient or medieval world.<br><strong>Above 2%</strong>, you have <strong>cast iron</strong> or <strong>pig iron</strong>; excessive carbon makes the steel much too hard and brittle, making it unsuitable for most purposes.</p>

Cast iron production was discovered much earlier in China than in most of the rest of the world, but cast iron products were brittle and not generally suitable for demanding use.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I don’t want to get too bogged down in the exact chemistry of how the introduction of carbon changes the metallic matrix of the iron; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel#Properties">you are welcome to read about it</a>.  <strong>As the carbon content of the iron increases, the iron’s basic characteristics – it’s ductility and hardness (among others) – changes</strong>.  Pure iron, when it takes a heavy impact, tends to deform (bend) to absorb that impact (it is ductile and soft).  Increasing the carbon-content makes the iron harder, causing it to both resist bending more and also to hold an edge better (hardness is the key characteristic for holding an edge through use).  In the right amount, the steel is springy, bending to absorb impacts but rapidly returning to its original shape.  But <em>too much</em> carbon and the steel becomes <em>too</em> hard and not ductile enough, causing it to become brittle.</p>



<p>Compared to the other materials available for tools and weapons, high carbon ‘spring steel’ was essentially the super-material of the pre-modern world.  High carbon steel is <em>dramatically</em> harder than iron, such that a good steel blade will bite – often surprisingly deeply – into an iron blade without much damage to itself.  Moreover, good steel can take fairly high energy impacts and simply bend to absorb the energy before springing back into its original shape (rather than, as with iron, having <em>plastic</em> deformation, where it bends, but doesn’t bend back – which is still better than <em>breaking</em>, but not much).  And for armor, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/04/collections-archery-distance-and-kiting/">you may recall from our previous</a> look at arrow penetration, a steel plate’s ability to resist puncture is <em>much</em> higher than the same plate made of iron (bronze, by the by, performs about as well as iron, assuming both are work hardened).  of course, different applications still prefer different carbon contents; armor, for instance, tended to benefit from somewhat lower carbon content than a sword blade.</p>



<p>It is sometimes contended that the ancients did not know the difference between iron and steel.  This is mostly a philological argument based on the infrequency of a technical distinction between the two in ancient languages.  Latin authors will frequently use <em>ferrum</em> (iron) to mean both iron and steel; Greek will use <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%2Fdhros&amp;highlight=iron">σίδηρος </a>(sideros, “iron”) much the same way.  The problem here is that high literature in the ancient world – which is almost all of the literature we have – has a strong aversion to technical terms <em>in general</em>; it would do no good for an elite writer to display knowledge more becoming to a tradesman than a senator.  That said in a handful of spots, Latin authors use <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dchalybs1&amp;highlight=steel"><em>chalybs</em> </a>(from the Greek χάλυψ) to mean steel, as distinct from iron.</p>



<p>More to the point, while our elite authors – who are, at most dilettantish observers of metallurgy, never active participants – may or may not know the difference,<strong> ancient artisans clearly did</strong>.  As Tylecote (<em>op. cit.</em>) notes, we see surface carburization on tools as clearly as 1000 B.C. in the Levant and Egypt, although the extent of its use and intentionality is hard to gauge to due rust and damage. There is no such problem with Gallic metallurgy from at least the La Tène period (450 BCE – 50 B.C.) or Roman metallurgy from c. 200 B.C., because we see evidence of smiths quite deliberately varying carbon content over the different parts of sword-blades (more carbon in the edges, less in the core) through pattern welding, which itself can leave a tell-tale ‘streaky’ appearance to the blade (these streaks can be faked, but there’s little point in faking them if they are not already understood to signify a better weapon).  There can be little doubt that the smith who welds a steel edge to an iron core to make a sword blade understands that there is something <em>different</em> about that edge (especially since he cannot, as we can, precisely test the hardness of the two every time – he must know a method that <em>generally</em> produces harder metal and be working from that assumption; high carbon steel, properly produced, can be much harder than iron, as we’ll see).</p>

The sword itself has a mild steel core with high carbon steel edges and a thin coating of high-carbon steel along the flat.  Almost certainly the higher carbon edge was welded on to the mild steel core during manufacture, an example of a blacksmith quite intentionally using different grades of steel.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That said, our ancient – or even medieval – smiths do not understand the chemistry of all of this, of course.  Understanding the effects of carbuzation and how to harness that to make better tools must have been something learned through experience and experimentation, not from theoretical knowledge – a thing passed from master to apprentice, with only slight modification in each generation (though it is equally clear that techniques could move quite quickly over cultural boundaries, since smiths with an inferior technique need only imitate a superior one).</p>



<h2>Making Steel</h2>



<p>Now, in modern steel-making, the main problem is an excess of carbon.  Steel, when smelted in a blast furnace, tends to have far too much carbon.  Consequently a lot of modern iron-working is about walking the steel down to a usefully low amount of carbon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking#Modern_processes">by getting excess carbon out of it</a>.  But ancient iron-working approaches the steeling problem from exactly the opposite direction, likely beginning with something close to a pure mass of iron and having to find ways to get more carbon into that iron to produce steel.</p>



<p><strong>So how do we take our carbon and get it into our iron?</strong>  Well, the good news is that the basic principle is actually very simple: <strong>when hot, iron will absorb carbon from the environment around it, although the process is quite slow</strong> if the iron is not molten (which it never is in these processes).  There are a few stages where that can happen and thus a few different ways of making steel out of our iron.</p>



<p>The popular assumption – in part because it was the working scholarly assumption for quite some time – is that iron can be at least partially …</p></div></div>

                  <p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7222836-Investigation-of-Competition-in-Digital-Markets.html">A recent report</a> from the US House of Representatives subcommittee on antitrust laws suggests that the requirement for all Quest 2 users to login via a Facebook account may be anticompetitive.</p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/ts_oculus-quest-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/ts_oculus-quest-2.png 600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/ts_oculus-quest-2.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is the first headset produced by Facebook that requires users to create an account on their social media site in order to set it up. The report states that, <em>“conditioning access to a product or service in which a firm has market power to the use of a separate product or service is anticompetitive.”</em></p><p>The report, which clocks in at a terrify 449 pages, investigates the issues of competition in the digital market. The report looks at companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, and yes, Facebook. The report only mentions VR a small number of times, but it does go into detail about the large acquisitions of that each company has made. This includes Facebook’s purchase of Oculus in 2014.</p><p>The report states,</p><p><em>“Facebook has also maintained and expanded its dominance through a series of acquisitions of companies it viewed as competitive threats, and selectively excluded competitors from using its platform to insulate itself from competitive pressure.</em></p><p><em>Facebook has also maintained its monopoly through a series of anticompetitive business practices. The company used its data advantage to create superior market intelligence to identify nascent competitive threats and then acquire, copy, or kill these firms. Once dominant, Facebook selectively enforced its platform policies based on whether it perceived other companies as competitive threats. In doing so, it advantaged its own services while weakening other firms.”</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/Sidequest-New-Logo-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>This has major implications for the future of the Oculus and developers, we have seen Facebook flex their considerable power over smaller developers. We have previously reported on the issues that the <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/unofficial-oculus-quest-appstore-receives-650-000-in-funding/">developer focused app store, Sidequest</a>, has had in gaining purchase in the Oculus ecosystem, not to mention the <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/vr-developers-are-concerned-about-facebooks-walled-garden/">side-lining of the VR steaming service, Bigscreen</a>, by giving favourable terms to large companies like Fandango. With Facebook offering the most affordable headset on the market, we may see even more developers become disillusioned with the Oculus ecosystem and move on to greener pastures.</p>
