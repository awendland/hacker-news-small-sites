<p>Vim is a highly customizable text editor geared towards writing code.
But open-ended configuration possibilities often lure users into wasting time while chasing after perceived minute gains in productivity.
This article describes my Vim journey, starting from heavy personal customization and ending with a renewed love for defaults.</p>

<h2 id="porn">Porn</h2>

<p>As a rule, new users, right after introduction to a few basic commands, start indulging in Vim configuration porn.
Such porn has various different flavours.
There is the “exhibitionist” variety which includes dressing Vim up in status lines, colorschemes, and font decorations in order to impress others.
It often leads to Vim being displayed on videos and, nomen omen, “vim-porn” screenshots.
There is an “integrated” category where people plug and stretch their Vim until it resembles an IDE.
Git integration, autocompletion, language servers, refactoring, and debugging are the tools of trade in this version.
And then there are a few more variants, including “fuzzy”, “packaged”, “conveniently re-mapped”, and I am sure anyone could think up some of their own.</p>

<p>My particular genre was “consistency” - I wanted my Vim to be intuitive and predictable.
While working I would constantly keep an eye for digressions in Vim’s behaviour and then spend my time trying to adjust them.
In my fantasy Vim had to feel intuitive and smooth so I tried to correct every little detail.
And, despite “consistency” porn being quite vanilla, I managed to construct a <code>vimrc</code> file exceeding one thousand lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="consistentvimrc">Consistent vimrc</h2>

<p>No point in sharing the entire collection, but here are a few illustrative examples and the rationale behind them.
Feel free to try them out, if that is your thing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Y</p>

<p>As is widely known <code>Y</code> is not consistent with other uppercase commands.
It copies the whole line while <code>D</code> and <code>C</code> operates from the cursor position to the end of line.
Simple remap fixes the issue.</p>

<pre><code>" make Y consistent with C and D.
nnoremap Y y$
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>n</code> and <code>N</code></p>

<p>Having the same characters always go in the same direction would be a lot easier.
So this map makes <code>n</code> always go forwards and <code>N</code> always go backwards<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.
Same for <code>;</code> and <code>,</code><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<pre><code>" make n always search forward and N backward
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; n 'Nn'[v:searchforward]
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; N 'nN'[v:searchforward]

" make ; always "find" forward and , backward
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; ; getcharsearch().forward ? ';' : ','
nnoremap &lt;expr&gt; , getcharsearch().forward ? ',' : ';'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>;</code> and <code>,</code></p>

<p>I disliked the forward and backward <code>f</code> repetition being under different characters: <code>;</code> and <code>,</code>.
This set of remaps puts them under the same key and moves away the colon command over to backtick.
The original backtick behaviour is transferred to a single quote.</p>

<pre><code>" make ; and , be on the same key
nnoremap : ,
nnoremap ` :
nnoremap ' `
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>l</code></p>

<p>This set of mappings makes the <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>l</code> keys perform consistent direction-related action in various circumstances: scrolling, changing and creating windows, moving across paragraphs.</p>

<pre><code>" make J, K, L, and H move the cursor MORE.
nnoremap J }
nnoremap K {
nnoremap L g_
nnoremap H ^

" make &lt;c-j&gt;, &lt;c-k&gt;, &lt;c-l&gt;, and &lt;c-h&gt; scroll the screen.
nnoremap &lt;c-j&gt; &lt;c-e&gt;
nnoremap &lt;c-k&gt; &lt;c-y&gt;
nnoremap &lt;c-l&gt; zl
nnoremap &lt;c-h&gt; zh

" make &lt;a-j&gt;, &lt;a-k&gt;, &lt;a-l&gt;, and &lt;a-h&gt; move to window.
nnoremap &lt;a-j&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;j
nnoremap &lt;a-k&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;k
nnoremap &lt;a-l&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;l
nnoremap &lt;a-h&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;h

" make &lt;a-J&gt;, &lt;a-K&gt;, &lt;a-L&gt;, and &lt;a-H&gt; create windows.
nnoremap &lt;a-J&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;s&lt;c-w&gt;k
nnoremap &lt;a-K&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;s
nnoremap &lt;a-H&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;v
nnoremap &lt;a-L&gt; &lt;c-w&gt;v&lt;c-w&gt;h
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>J</code> and <code>K</code>.</p>

<p>If you think about how Vim moves across sentences and words you will notice that it doesn’t place the cursor on the empty space between them, but rather on the first and last characters.
Similarly this bad boy makes <code>J</code> and <code>K</code> commands place the cursor on the outermost lines while moving from paragraph to paragraph.
Consistent.</p>

<pre><code>" move to the edge of a paragraph.
function! s:Move(isUp, isInVisual)
  if a:isInVisual
    normal! gv
  end
  let curpos = getcurpos()
  let firstline='\(^\s*\n\)\zs\s*\S\+'
  let lastline ='\s*\S\+\ze\n\s*$'
  let flags = 'Wn'. (a:isUp ? 'b' : '')
  " Move to first or last line of paragraph, or to the beginning/end of file
  let pat = '\('.firstline.'\|'.lastline.'\)\|\%^\|\%$'
  " make sure cursor moves and search does not get stuck on current line
  call cursor(line('.'), a:isUp ? 1 : col('$'))
  let target=search(pat, flags)
  if target &gt; 0
    let curpos[1]=target
    let curpos[2]=curpos[4]
  end
  call setpos('.',curpos)
endfu

" H K L J for moving to paragraph edge
nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; J :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(0, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; K :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(1, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
vnoremap &lt;silent&gt; J :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(0, 1)&lt;cr&gt;
vnoremap &lt;silent&gt; K :&lt;c-u&gt;call &lt;sid&gt;Move(1, 1)&lt;cr&gt;
onoremap J V:call &lt;sid&gt;Move(0, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
onoremap K V:call &lt;sid&gt;Move(1, 0)&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>ge</code></p>

<p>To understand the inconsistency with <code>ge</code> consider how Vim behaves across 4 distinct commands:</p>

<pre><code>Cursor position       Command        Result
------------------------------------------------
word1 word2           de             wo word2
  ^                   dw             woword2

word1 word2           db             word1 rd2
        ^             dge            wordd2
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>dge</code> is inconsistent in two ways: first, unlike <code>db</code>, it deletes the character under the cursor; second, unlike <code>dw</code>, it deletes the last character of the word it moves towards.
Remap below made it more consistent.</p>

<pre><code>" make commands with ge consistent with b and w
onoremap ge :execute "normal! " . v:count1 . "ge&lt;space&gt;"&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>&amp;</code></p>

<p>Here remap makes the substitution repeat command reuse the flags of the previous invocation.</p>

<pre><code>" make substitution repeat to reuse last flags
nnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;cr&gt;
xnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let that be the end of examples.
I had many more but you probably get the point by now.
The simple truth is that my thousand line vimrc file didn’t give me any comfort.
The feeling I had when I opened it up is best described as a kind of anxiety.
I often felt a weird push to improve it, organize it better, make it more consistent.
Until one day I had enough and pressed delete.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="afreshstart">A fresh start</h2>

<p>So, no more vimrc.
It did feel sloppy, at first.
But I quickly found a new way to get around.</p>

<p>Some of the issues with highly customized configuration files are known to everyone.
You have to use a plugin to manage your plugins; have to transfer dotfiles across different servers; lose the ability to work on machines without your configuration files; others cannot use your computer without disabling your setup first.
Removing the heavy configuration got rid of those downsides.
But in addition I noticed a few additional less talked about benefits which are listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reduced confusion</p>

<p>When my vimrc grew, it became harder to remember all the maps and remaps that were in there.
So when adjusting configuration sometimes I would overwrite my previous mappings and other times I would apply the same “consistency fix” twice, in two slightly different ways, ending up with two different keys being remapped to the same operation.
In general changing things or reading and searching the help pages became cumbersome.</p>

<p>And proper fixes are often hard, harder than you might think.
Take even the simplest example: making <code>cw</code> consistent with <code>dw</code>.
Maybe some haven’t noticed but in Vim <code>cw</code> behaves like <code>ce</code>: it changes text to the end of the current word, not to the beginning of the next word.
It looks like an easy thing to change but the best known implementation is close to 20 lines of vimscript<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>, and there is no guarantee that it is perfect.
You always have to track various edge cases and add checks for different modes, empty lines, end of file situations.
Without such careful treatment the fix will be inconsistent itself.</p>

<p>In addition some consistency bandages themselves introduced inconsistencies in other places.
As an example take the remap between colon and comma.
Remember - I remapped colon to be consistent with semicolon and transferred the original command-line operation to backtick.
But this left <code>g;</code> and <code>g,</code> unadjusted which is, you guessed it, still inconsistent.
Even if we adjust them the <code>":</code> register is still there.
So, to redo the last command-line operation I still have to call <code>@:</code> even if my command-line operation itself is now under backtick.
Those inconsistencies never end.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased flexibility</p>

<p>I became accustomed to my simplified mappings and slowly but surely lost the ability to control more complex commands.
A good example is my <code>&lt;leader&gt;R</code> map:</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;R :belowright 20split | terminal R --no-save --no-restore&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It opened up a <code>:terminal</code> buffer below the current window, set it to 20 lines in height, and launched R in it.
Sweet little command, right?
Well yes.
But it only allowed me to open R in a fixed size window.
It somehow took away my knowledge of opening a window anywhere, in any size, and running any command in it.
I got used to this simplicity so much I was no longer able to open python in a 30 line height window without checking the syntax of my R remap in the vimrc first.</p>

<p>Using registers is another good example.
One map I had was <code>&lt;leader&gt;y</code> which copied the text into the system clipboard.
Simple, convenient, and fast.
When it was no longer there I was forced to issue the full command, which is <code>"+y</code>.
It may be slightly less convenient but seeing and using this syntax makes it clear what is going on and it naturally encourages the use of different registers.
When I got in the habit of yanking text into the <code>+</code> register my usage of custom registers became much more frequent as a side effect.
A new side of Vim, previously layered by my custom remaps, opened up and expanded.</p>

<p>Similar thing happened with yanking text and using it to replace another piece of text.
It is a common enough procedure and so I turned to plugins for help.
Using a plugin<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> was convenient.
It was so convenient that I didn’t have to think about it, just yank text, issue an operator, define a motion, and bam - the replacement took place.
After I …</p></li></ul></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div inner_tag="div"><div><div><p><strong>In the global race to measure ever shorter time spans, physicists from Goethe University Frankfurt have now taken the lead: together with colleagues at the accelerator facility DESY in Hamburg and the Fritz-Haber-Institute in Berlin, they have measured a process that lies within the realm of zeptoseconds for the first time: the propagation of light within a molecule. A zeptosecond is a trillionth of a billionth of a second (10-21 seconds).<br></strong><br>FRANKFURT. In 1999, the Egyptian chemist Ahmed Zewail received the Nobel Prize for measuring the speed at which molecules change their shape. He founded femtochemistry using ultrashort laser flashes: the formation and breakup of chemical bonds occurs in the realm of femtoseconds. A femtosecond equals 0.000000000000001 seconds, or 10-15 seconds. </p><p>Now atomic physicists at Goethe University in Professor Reinhard Dörner's team have for the first time studied a process that is shorter than femtoseconds by magnitudes. They measured how long it takes for a photon to cross a hydrogen molecule: about 247 zeptoseconds for the average bond length of the molecule. This is the shortest timespan that has been successfully measured to date.</p><p>The scientists carried out the time measurement on a hydrogen molecule (H2) which they irradiated with X-rays from the synchrotron lightsource PETRA III at the Hamburg accelerator centre DESY. The researchers set the energy of the X-rays so that one photon was sufficient to eject both electrons out of the hydrogen molecule.</p><p>Electrons behave like particles and waves simultaneously, and therefore the ejection of the first electron resulted in electron waves launched first in the one, and then in the second hydrogen molecule atom in quick succession, with the waves merging.</p><p>The photon behaved here much like a flat pebble that is skimmed twice across the water: when a&nbsp; wave trough meets a wave crest, the waves of the first and second water contact cancel each other, resulting in what is called an interference pattern.</p><p>The scientists measured the interference pattern of the first ejected electron using the COLTRIMS reaction microscope, an apparatus that Dörner helped develop and which makes ultrafast reaction processes in atoms and molecules visible. Simultaneously with the interference pattern, the COLTRIMS reactions microscope also allowed the determination of the orientation of the hydrogen molecule. The researchers here took advantage of the fact that the second electron also left the hydrogen molecule, so that the remaining hydrogen nuclei flew apart and were detected.</p><p>&nbsp;“Since we knew the spatial orientation of the hydrogen molecule, we used the interference of the two electron waves to precisely calculate when the photon reached the first and when it reached the second hydrogen atom," explains Sven Grundmann whose doctoral dissertation forms the basis of the scientific article in Science. “And this is up to 247 zeptoseconds, depending on how far apart in the molecule the two atoms were from the perspective of light."</p><p>Professor Reinhard Dörner adds: “We observed for the first time that the electron shell in a molecule does not react to light everywhere at the same time. The time delay occurs because information within the molecule only spreads at the speed of light. With this finding we have extended our COLTRIMS technology to another application."</p><p><strong>Publication: </strong>Sven Grundmann, Daniel Trabert, Kilian Fehre, Nico Strenger, Andreas Pier, Leon Kaiser, Max Kircher, Miriam Weller, Sebastian Eckart, Lothar Ph.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main id="main-content-container"><article aria-label="GDPR watchdog’s investigation finds that tracking and consent pop-ups used by Google and other major websites and apps are unlawful."><div>
<p>The Belgian Data Protection Authority (APD-GBA) has found serious GDPR infringements in the system Google and others use to legitimise online tracking. The system behind nearly all of the consent messages that pop up on screens in Europe has been found to infringe the GDPR. The APD-GBA is the lead enforcer on this issue for the EU.</p>



<p>The system is known as the “Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (TCF)”. It was introduced by the tracking industry’s standards body, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) as an attempt to convince enforcers that online advertising’s controversial “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) system was compliant with the GDPR. Google started to use the TCF this year.</p>



<p>But the IAB’s system allows companies to swap sensitive information about people, even when this has not been authorised. According to the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service, </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“IAB Europe’s approach demonstrates that it neglects the risks that would impact on the rights and freedoms of data subjects”. &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>RTB operates behind the scenes on websites and apps. It constantly broadcasts the private things that people do and watch online to tracking companies. It also tells them where we are in the real world. There is no way of limiting what then happens to any of these data.</p>



<p>Europe’s RTB advertising market was worth €6.7bn in 2019. There is no estimate of the market value of personal data gathered through the RTB system. However, publishers have been increasingly worried about the theft of their audiences through the RTB system.</p>



<p>According to the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service, the IAB does not provide adequate controls for the processing of the most intimate data, which the GDPR calls “special category” data. &nbsp;Last month the Irish Council for Civil Liberties <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/human-rights/info-privacy/rtb-data-breach-2-years-on/">revealed that RTB data was used to profile LGBT+ people to influence a national election</a>, and that RTB data had been used to profile victims of incest and sexual abuse.</p>



<p>The Belgian findings come as part of a campaign of GDPR complaints against the RTB data breach launched two years ago by <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/staff/dr-johnny-ryan/">Dr Johnny Ryan</a> of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, who was then a tech executive. He said: </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“the pop-ups that plague us tens of times a day were an attempt to paint a thin legal veneer over the vast data breach at the heart of the behavioural advertising system. The Belgian Data Protection Authority is rightly peeling this veneer off, and exposing massive illegality in online behavioural advertising”</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>United States</strong></p>



<p>The IAB offers legal guidance to the global tracking industry. In October it began to market a system based on the TCF for California’s new privacy law, the CCPA. In August, it launched the IAB Privacy Lab, to lobby lawmakers and produce variants of the TCF for regional laws.</p>



<p>But the Belgian privacy watchdog has now found that even the privacy policy on the IAB’s own website infringes the GDPR, and that the IAB has failed to appoint a data protection officer. </p>



<p>Pierre Dewitte, of the University of Leuven, a complainant, said</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“the findings about the IAB’s poor internal GDPR compliance show its lack of expertise, or interest, in the most elementary aspects of data protection and privacy law”</em>. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The Belgian authority’s report says <em>“the Inspection Service believes that IAB Europe is trying to avoid its liability to the GDPR, constituting an aggravating circumstance”</em>. </p>



<p>Ravi Naik, solicitor who worked on the original complaints, said </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“These findings are damning and overdue. As the standard setters, the IAB is responsible for breaches of the GDPR. Their supervisory authority has rightly found that the IAB “neglects” the risks to data subjects. The IAB’s responsibility now is to stop these&nbsp;breaches”</em>.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Belgian Data Protection Authority’s Inspectorate Service has forwarded its findings to the Litigation Chamber, and action will be taken in early 2021. </p>



<p>Dr Jef Ausloos, of University of Amsterdam, a complaint, said </p>



<blockquote><p><em>“I am happy to see a data protection authority resolve to take on the tracking industry. This may be the first step in taking down surveillance capitalism”. </em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Who is involved in the RTB campaign?</strong></p>



<p>There are 22 RTB complainants, individuals and organisations, in 16 EU Member States. They are Dr Johnny Ryan, Senior Fellow of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties; Jim Killock Executive Director of the Open Rights Group; Dr Michael Veale of the Turing Institute; Katarzyna Szymielewicz, CEO of the Panoptykon Foundation; Evelyn Austin, Director of Bits of Freedom; Gemma Galdon Clavell, CEO of the Eticas Foundation; Jose Belo; Dr Jef Ausloos of the University of Amsterdam; Pierre Dewitte of the University of Leuven; Liberties.eu; the Society for Civil Rights; Digitale courage; Ligue des droits humains; Digitale Gesellschaft; Netzwerk Datenschutzexpertise; Deutsche Vereinigung für Datenschutz; the Italian Coalition for Civil Rights and Freedoms; the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee; the Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Romania; the Italian Coalition for Civil Rights and Freedoms; the Estonian Human Rights Centre; the Peace Institute.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of October, 2020, Hugo Xu (a.k.a. "jspenguin2017") <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362">announced</a> he had sold Nano to "a team of Turkish developers". No further information was posted.</p>
<p>This immediately aroused suspicion. Who <em>are</em> these "Turkish developers"? Who controls the code? Why has the Privacy Policy been removed?</p>
<p>Fast forward 12 days later, Raymond Hill (developer of uBlock Origin) started to <a href="https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore/issues/362#issuecomment-709428210">dig deeper</a>. Raymond inspected the modifications added by the new developers (which was not published to GitHub), revealing their dubious intentions.</p>
<p>The extension transmits your data to an <a href="https://def.dev-nano.com/">unknown server</a>, sending information about web requests (which may contain confidential information). This is a backdoor, and presents a <em>major</em> privacy risk to users of the Nano suite.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shortly after, these same "Turkish developers" published a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nano-dev">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Despite working <em>without</em> collecting data, the new Nano developers have chosen to collect the following data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your IP Address,</li>
<li>Your Country,</li>
<li>URL's,</li>
<li>Time of your web requests,</li>
<li>HTTP Methods <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">(POST, GET, HEAD, etc.)</a></li>
<li>Size of HTTP Responses,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Response_codes">(HTTP Status Response Codes)</a></li>
<li>Your Operating System and "other parameters about the device operating system and/or the User's IT environment",</li>
<li>Time spent on each web page,</li>
<li>URL's navigated in the application.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that's not enough, the new developers have not released an official statement.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, what can you do? Remove this extension <strong>immediately!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation">uBlock Origin</a> is a fine alternative to Nano.</p>
<p>It comes with greater stability, many more contributors, and no data collection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember to audit your extensions frequently, and remove any unused extensions.</p>
<p>In the case of Nano Defender, users were not notified before control of the extension was transferred to a third-party. That's not the right way to handle this.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we can learn from this and move forward.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I've just been told that LiCybora, the author of the Firefox Nano extensions, has full control over the Firefox extensions. <a href="https://github.com/LiCybora/NanoDefenderFirefox/issues/187">They're safe for now.</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>It’s been 13 years since Yudkowsky published the sequences, and 11 years since he wrote “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning">Rationality is Systematized Winning</a>“.</p>
<p>So where are all the winners?</p>
<p>The people that jump to mind are Nick Bostrom (Oxford Professor of Philosophy, author), Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld (run OpenPhil and GiveWell, directing ~300M in annual donations) and Will MacAskill (Oxford Professor of Philosophy, author).</p>
<p>But somehow that feels like cheating. We know rationalism is a good meme, so it doesn’t seem fair to cite people whose accomplishments are largely built off of convincing someone else that rationalism is important. They’re successful, but at a meta-level, only in the same way Steve Bannon is successful, and to a much lesser extent.</p>
<p>By comparison, Miyamoto Musashi, who Yudkowsky quotes extensively in the post, and who coined the phrase “the Ichi school is the spirit of winning”, appears to have been one of the greatest swordsmen of his era. According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi#First_duel">Wikipedia</a>, he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fought duels against the most famous schools in Kyoto, and never lost</li>
<li>Defeated an “adept” at age 13</li>
<li>Was granted the title “Unrivaled Under Heaven” by the shogun at 21</li>
<li>Single handedly ended the Yoshioka School by defeating 3 masters, and then a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshioka-ry%C5%AB">70 person ambush</a> of followers</li>
</ul>
<p>One explanation is that rationalism entails a particular value system that guides rationalists away from becoming prominent politicians or entrepreneurs. This isn’t obviously absurd. Very successful people are often described as ambitious, smart and hardworking, but rarely as intellectually honest. Analogously, Ecclesiastical orders often had the highest literacy rates, but had philosophical objections to using that leverage to gain influence in other spheres.</p>
<p>Except that they totally did anyway. Pope Urban II initiated the crusades, a holy war of massive proportions. Pope Clement VII was so influential that King Henry VIII had to leave the church and invent in Anglicanism just to escape. And Pope Innocent III claimed influence over all the kings of Europe, single handedly annulled the Magna Carta, and in an act of nominative anti-determinism, directed the sack of Constantiple.</p>
<p>Even today, churches are enormously powerful and wealthy. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#:~:text=After%20the%20Time%20article%20was,at%20%2425%20to%20%2430%20billion.">LDS</a> has an estimated $5B in annual revenue, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mormon-church-amassed-100-billion-it-was-the-best-kept-secret-in-the-investment-world-11581138011">an estimated $100B</a> in funds, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_affiliations_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#:~:text=Almost%20all%20of%20the%20presidents,Presbyterians%20being%20the%20most%20prevalent.">protestants can make claims to nearly every US president</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you think rationalism is genuinely rooted in altruism, they strongly recommend “earning to give”, which ought to result in rationalists leading hedge funds, startups and so on.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen once <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15122162/tyler-cowen-ezra-klein-interview-podcast">called rationalism</a> “just another kind of religion”, but if so, it seems to be a fairly unsuccessful one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Still, no one can deny that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls/">they have noticed the skulls</a>. Whatever criticism one makes of rationalists, they have likely made of themselves many times over.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Systematised Winning, Scott Alexander wrote <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LgavAYtzFQZKg95WC/extreme-rationality-it-s-not-that-great">Extreme Rationality: It’s Not That Great</a> claiming that there is “approximately zero empirical evidence that x-rationality has a large effect on your practical success”, and giving several possible explanations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness of will: Even with good ideas, rationalists can’t execute</li>
<li>Specific knowledge beats out generalized theoretical knowledge</li>
<li>Noise</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is particularly interesting, Scott goes on to say that “people in finance tend to know this and use specially developed x-rationalist techniques on the job already without making it a lifestyle commitment.” In addition to specialization, practitioners have the benefit of learning a system of practice built by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html">tradition smarter than you</a>. A person can compete against their own irrational self, but they shouldn’t expect to win against a centuries old practice.</p>
<p>What about dynamic fields, or new fields without precedent?</p>
<p>Many startup CEOs are young generalists who did not learn their craft through a career at McKinsey or an MBA program at Harvard. It’s not clear that tech entrepreneurship has a storied tradition of practice, aside from maybe the abundance of podcasts free to all.</p>
<p>A better excuse is that startup founders are just totally insane, in a way that precludes any rational or even rationalist person from joining their ranks. Elon Musk famously compared entrepreneurship to “chewing glass and staring into the abyss”; Paul Graham warned “If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine”.</p>
<p>That’s the best case scenario where things go according to plan. The much more likely outcome is that you stagnate for years, raise money from, hire or alienate all your friends, are resented by every employee you sold on a billion dollar exit, who by the way, are the only people you ever see, all while sacrificing your physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>This should also be considered against a very high baseline quality of life. The alternative to running a tech company isn’t the median human existence, it’s being an incredibly well paid engineer or tech executive and retiring in your 30s.</p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking of baselines, what exactly should we expect from the rationalist community?</p>
<p>If it was a bunch of uneducated basement dwellers, we shouldn’t be shocked to learn that rationalism was unable to transform them into heads of state and captains of industry.</p>
<p>But the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/2019%20SSC%20Survey.html">SCC survey results</a> paint a different picture. Over 40% of readers work in software engineering, IT, and computer science, with another 4.7% in finance and 3% in physics, 6.7% in engineering, and 3.8% in law. 12% have PhDs, another 25% have Master’s degrees, and another 40% have Bachelor’s.</p>
<p>All else equal, we should expect these people to do fairly well, or at least have the potential to once imbued with some kind of cognitive superpower.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two possible conspiratorial views:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The world is run by rationalists, but you haven’t heard of them. From an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/15/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-years-in-an-alternate-universe/">earlier SSC post</a>:&nbsp; “large organizations tend to have a position that pretty much controls everything from behind the scenes but doesn’t have to cope with the appearance of power”</p>
</li>
<li><p>The world is run by rationalists, but they haven’t outed themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As with all conspiracies, these views are not only crazy, but also unfalsifiable. I could just as easily claim that the world is secretly run by freemasons. From a Bayesian perspective, the evidence is equally well explained by the both hypotheses, so we should stick with our prior that there is not a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Instead, I propose the weak conspiracy, which is that many successful people have read rationalist blogs, but do not make it part of their identity. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tyler Cowen: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/30/15122162/tyler-cowen-ezra-klein-interview-podcast">I enjoy all those sources, and I read them. That’s obviously a kind of endorsement.</a>“</li>
<li>Paul Graham: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/909070952465600512">There’s no one writing now that I admire more than Scott Alexander</a>“</li>
<li>Matt Levine: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/795743276036923392">Does anyone else think about this [SSC] article every day?</a>“</li>
<li>Patrick Collison: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/1005903040115814400">…Scott Alexander’s deservedly famous Meditations on Moloch</a>“</li>
<li>Steven Pinker: “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1275406500492697601?lang=en">Tragedy in the blogosphere: One of the best [SSC] is being taken down.</a>“</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, now the question is: “do rationalists become successful, or do successful people just like blogs on the internet?” We might try to infer causality from timing. As of 2009, every one of those people was already successful, which points in favor of the latter hypothesis.</p>
<hr>
<p>Instead of more theorizing, I’ll end by offering my own testimony.</p>
<p>The primary impacts of reading rationalist blogs are that 1) I have been frequently distracted at work, and 2) my conversations have gotten much worse. Talking to non-rationalists, I am perpetually holding myself back from saying “oh yes, that’s just the thing where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/01/is-it-possible-to-have-coherent-principles-around-free-speech-norms/">no one has coherent</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">meta-principles</a>“ or “that’s the thing where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://meaningness.com/eggplant/refrigerator">facts are purpose-dependent</a>“. Talking to rationalists is not much better, since it feels less like a free exchange of ideas, and more like an exchange of “have you read <x> post?”</x></p>
<p>There are some specific areas where rationality might help, like using Yudkowsky’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> to know when it’s plausible to think I have an original insight that is not already “priced into the market”, but even here, I’m not convinced these beat out specific knowledge. If you want to start a defensible monopoly, reading about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2018/07/29/mind-the-moat-a-7-powers-review/">business strategy</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup">startup-specific strategy</a> will probably be more useful than trying to reason about “efficiency” in a totally abstract sense.</p>
<p>And yet, I will continue reading these blogs, and if Slate Star Codex ever releases a new post, I will likely drop whatever I am doing to read it. This has nothing to do with self-improvement or “systematized winning”.</p>
<p>It’s solely because weird blogs on the internet make me feel less alone.</p>
<p>Before reading <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human's_Guide_to_Words">A Human’s Guide to Words</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/">The Categories Were Made For Man</a>, I went around thinking “oh god, no one is using language coherently, and I seem to be the only one seeing it, but I cannot even express my horror in a comprehensible way.” This felt like a hellish combination of being trapped in an illusion, questioning my own sanity, and simultaneously being unable to scream. For years, I wondered if I was just uniquely broken, and living in a reality that no one else seemed to see or understand.</p>
<p>So the defense of “rationality as systematized winning” is not even a causal one. I don’t claim to have benefited in any real way from rationality, nor can I really recommend it to anyone who isn’t already inclined to read these blogs. The point of winning is not to make money, or gain influence, or even to altruistically produce more QALYs. The point is that for my reality to even feel legitimate, it needs to have bearing on the consensus shared reality.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that Slate Star Codex is gone, this project feels more necessary than ever. Substack promised to fund independent writing, but instead, has largely replaced eclectic blogs with rapid-fire newsletters that follow the news-cycle. The kinds of people who would have been rationalist writers are instead mass-producing insight-porn on Twitter, or starting Progress Studies blogs to share historical trivia.</p>
<p>A smart person would take this …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After I published my $1 MCU write-up, several readers suggested I look at application processors — the MMU-endowed chips necessary to run real operating systems like Linux. Massive shifts over the last few years have seen internet-connected devices become more featureful (and hopefully, more secure), and I’m finding myself putting Linux into more and more places.</p><p>Among beginner engineers, application processors supplicate reverence: one minor PCB bug and your $10,000 prototype becomes a paperweight. There’s an occult consortium of engineering pros who drop these chips into designs with utter confidence, while the uninitiated cower for their Raspberry Pis and overpriced industrial SOMs.</p><p>This article is targeted at embedded engineers who are familiar with microcontrollers but not with microprocessors or Linux, so I wanted to put together something with a quick primer on why you’d want to run embedded Linux, a broad overview of what’s involved in designing around application processors, and then a dive into some specific parts you should check out — and others you should avoid — for entry-level embedded Linux systems.</p><p>Just like my microcontroller article, the parts I picked range from the well-worn horses that have pulled along products for the better part of this decade, to fresh-faced ICs with intriguing capabilities that you can keep up your sleeve.</p><p>If my mantra for the microcontroller article was that you should pick the right part for the job and not be afraid to learn new software ecosystems, my argument for this post is even simpler: once you’re booted into Linux on basically <em>any</em> of these parts, they become identical development environments.</p><p>That makes chips running embedded Linux almost a commodity product: as long as your processor checks off the right boxes, your application code won’t know if it’s running on an ST or a Microchip part — even if one of those is a brand-new dual-core Cortex-A7 and the other is an old ARM9. Your I2C drivers, your GPIO calls — even your V4L-based image processing code — will all work seamlessly.</p><p>At least, that’s the sales pitch. Getting a part booted is an entirely different ordeal altogether — that’s what we’ll be focused on. Except for some minor benchmarking at the end, once we get to a shell prompt, we’ll consider the job completed.</p><p>As a departure from my microcontroller review, this time I’m focusing heavily on hardware design: unlike the microcontrollers I reviewed, these chips vary considerably in PCB design difficulty — a discussion I would be in error to omit. To this end, I designed a dev board from scratch for each application processor reviewed. Well, actually, <em>many</em> dev boards for each processor: roughly 25 different designs in total. This allowed me to try out different DDR layout and power management strategies — as well as fix some bugs along the way.</p><p>I intentionally designed these boards from scratch rather than starting with someone else’s CAD files. This helped me discover little “gotchas” that each CPU has, as well as optimize the design for cost and hand-assembly. Each of these boards was designed across one or two days’ worth of time and used JLC’s low-cost 4-layer PCB manufacturing service.</p><p>These boards won’t win any awards for power consumption or EMC: to keep things easy, I often cheated by combining power rails together that would typically be powered (and sequenced!) separately. Also, I limited the on-board peripherals to the bare minimum required to boot, so there are no audio CODECs, little I2C sensors, or Ethernet PHYs on these boards.</p><p id="differences">As a result, the boards I built for this review are akin to the notes from your high school history class or a recording you made of yourself practicing a piece of music to study later. So while I’ll post pictures of the boards and screenshots of layouts to illustrate specific points, these aren’t intended to serve as reference designs or anything; the whole point of the review is to get you to a spot where you’ll want to go off and design <em>your own</em> little Linux boards. Teach a person to fish, you know?</p><h2>Microcontroller vs Microprocessor: Differences</h2><p>Coming from microcontrollers, the first thing you’ll notice is that Linux doesn’t usually run on Cortex-M, 8051, AVR, or other popular microcontroller architectures. Instead, we use <em>application processors</em> — popular ones are the Arm Cortex-A, ARM926EJ-S, and several MIPS iterations.</p><p>The biggest difference between these application processors and a microcontroller is quite simple: microprocessors have a memory management unit (MMU), and microcontrollers don’t. Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CClinux">you can run Linux without an MMU</a>, but you usually shouldn’t: Cortex-M7 parts that can barely hit 500 MHz routinely go for double or quadruple the price of faster Cortex-A7s. They’re power-hungry: microcontrollers are built on larger processes than application processors to reduce their leakage current. And without an MMU and generally-low clock speeds, they’re downright slow.</p><p id="why">Other than the MMU, the lines between MCUs and MPUs are getting blurred. Modern application processors often feature a similar peripheral complement as microcontrollers, and high-end Cortex-M7 microcontrollers often have similar clock speeds as entry-level application processors.</p><h2>Why would you want to Linux?</h2><p>When your microcontroller project outgrows its super loop and the random ISRs you’ve sprinkled throughout your code with care, there are many bare-metal tasking kernels to turn to — <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/">FreeRTOS</a>, ThreadX (now <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/rtos/">Azure RTOS</a>), <a href="https://www.rt-thread.io/">RT-Thread</a>, <a href="https://www.micrium.com/rtos/kernels/">μC/OS</a>, etc. By an academic definition, these are operating systems. However, compared to Linux, it’s more useful to think of these as a framework you use to write your bare-metal application inside. They provide the core components of an operating system: threads (and obviously a scheduler), semaphores, message-passing, and events. Some of these also have networking, filesystems, and other libraries.</p><p>Comparing bare-metal RTOSs to Linux simply comes down to the fundamental difference <em>between </em>these and Linux: memory management and protection. This one technical difference makes Linux running on an application processor behave quite differently from your microcontroller running an RTOS.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1');">1</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1">Before the RTOS snobs attack with pitchforks, yes, there are large-scale, well-tested RTOSes that are usually run on application processors with memory management units. Look at <a href="https://www.rtems.org/">RTEMS</a> as an example. They don’t have some of the limitations discussed below, and have many advantages over Linux for safety-critical real-time applications.</span></p><h4>Dynamic memory allocation</h4><p>Small microcontroller applications can usually get by with static allocations for everything, but as your application grows, you’ll find yourself calling malloc() more and more, and that’s when weird bugs will start creeping up in your application. With complex, long-running systems, you’ll notice things working 95% of the time — only to crash at random (and usually inopportune) times. These bugs evade the most javertian developers, and in my experience, they almost always stem from memory allocation issues: usually either memory leaks (that can be fixed with appropriate free() calls), or more serious problems like memory fragmentation (when the allocator runs out of appropriately-sized free blocks).</p><p>Because Linux-capable application processors have a memory management unit, *alloc() calls execute swiftly and reliably. Physical memory is only reserved (<em>faulted in</em>) when you actually access a memory location. Memory fragmentation is much less an issue since Linux frees and reorganizes pages behind the scenes. Plus, switching to Linux provides easier-to-use diagnostic tools (like <a href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a>) to catch bugs in your application code in the first place. And finally, because applications run in virtual memory, if your app <em>does</em> have memory bugs in it, Linux will kill it — leaving the rest of your system running. <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2');">2</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2">As a last-ditch kludge, it’s not uncommon to call your app in a superloop shell script to automatically restart it if it crashes without having to restart the entire system.</span></p><h4>Networking &amp; Interoperability</h4><p>Running something like lwIP under FreeRTOS on a bare-metal microcontroller is acceptable for a lot of simple applications, but application-level network services like HTTP can burden you to implement in a reliable fashion. Stuff that seems simple to a desktop programmer — like a WebSockets server that can accept multiple simultaneous connections — can be tricky to implement in bare-metal network stacks. Because C doesn’t have good programming constructs for asynchronous calls or exceptions, code tends to contain either a lot of weird state machines or tons of nested branches. It’s horrible to debug problems that occur. In Linux, you get a first-class network stack, plus tons of rock-solid userspace libraries that sit on top of that stack and provide application-level network connectivity. Plus, you can use a variety of high-level programming languages that are easier to handle the asynchronous nature of networking.</p><p>Somewhat related is the rest of the standards-based communication / interface frameworks built into the kernel. I2S, parallel camera interfaces, RGB LCDs, SDIO, and basically all those other scary high-bandwidth interfaces seem to come together much faster when you’re in Linux. But the big one is USB host capabilities. On Linux, USB devices <em>just work</em>. If your touchscreen drivers are glitching out and you have a client demo to show off in a half-hour, just plug in a USB mouse until you can fix it (I’ve been there before). Product requirements change and now you need audio? Grab a $20 USB dongle until you can respin the board with a proper audio codec. On many boards without Ethernet, I just use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter to allow remote file transfer and GDB debugging. Don’t forget that, at the end of the day, an embedded Linux system is shockingly similar to your computer.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>When thinking about embedded device security, there are usually two things we’re talking about: device …</p></div></div></div>

					        			<p>Posted by Paul on January 29, 2017</p>		
        		</div><div>
        			<p><strong>Back in 2007 I was very excited to start reading <em>The Singularity is Near</em> by Ray Kurzweil which had been published 2 years earlier in 2005. As someone who'd always been fascinated by computers and technology since I started programming my first ZX Spectrum as a child, through to my teenage years programming in QBASIC, to my work as a Web Developer, I was well aware of Moore's law and very conscious of the accelerating progress in technology.</strong></p>
<p>As I started to read, it became clear that this was an exceptional book. The clarity of Kurzweil's writing, the level of detail he went in to about each concept he discussed and the content itself were entirely captivating, not least because the predictions were set to happen in the near future and would change the world in to an unrecognisable utopia. In fact, although Kurzweil says early on in the book that his view of the future is neither utopian nor dystopian, the future described is so rosy that the Singularity has also been called "the Geeks' Rapture".</p>
<p>Indeed, if Kurzweil's predictions do come true, they are comparible in their size and implications to the Second Coming of Jesus - the conquering of death and the unification of all consciousness in to one computational substrate that is to become more powerful than anything in the Universe and spreads outward from the Earth at the speed of light ... or faster!</p>
<p>The book quickly became an absolute page-turner for me and as incredulous as it sounded, Kurzweil backed up every prediction with thorough research, logic, and his own impressive credentials - Kurzweil was something of a child prodigy who programmed computers and wrote scientific papers at an early age and became the inventor of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and the Kurzweil digital pianos and keyboards that bear his name. Kurzweil now works at Google where his job description is "to bring natural language understanding to Google" - a goal not too distant from developing an AI capable of passing the Turing test.</p>
<p>During my time as a software developer, discussions often arose about the future of technology and I would occasionally lend the book to other developers. Unfortunately, at some point the book wasn't returned and I wasn't too fussed as I'd already read it thoroughly. Recently, I decided to buy another copy and re-read it - after all, I still consider it to be one of the best books I've ever read. This time though, 12 years after the initial publication, it would be possible to see how Kurzweil's predictions had done.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Kurzweil himself has released a document describing how his predictions are faring which can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/How-My-Predictions-Are-Faring.pdf</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately though, he doesn't always seem to be intellectually honest with himself:</p>
<div><p>"PREDICTION<br>Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas.</p><p>ACCURACY <br>Essentially correct</p></div>
<p>In The Singularity is Near, the wording could be interpreted to mean that it is commonly <br>used, which is not yet the case, but this is likely to become the case over the next couple <br>of years."</p>
<p>Well that was 2010, it's now 2017 - where are these eyeglasses and contact lenses? What about Google Glass? Well it may still be being developed, but it certainly isn't in common use. Kurzweil also tends to mark many of his other predictions as "correct", when really they're not, even now in 2017.</p>
<p>So, let's get on to my re-reading of <em>The Singularity is Near</em>, which even for the second time I thoroughly enjoyed and took away a load more fascinating information that I may have missed on the first reading. This time I noted any predictions as I went through that we can now verify and what I found is below.</p>
<h2>On pages 11 and 12 we have:</h2>
<p>"James Watson, the codiscoverer of DNA, said that in fifty years we will have drugs that will allow us to eat as much as we want without gaining weight.<br>I replied, 'Fifty years?' We have accomplished this already in mice by blocking the fat insulin receptor gene that controls the storage of fat in the fat cells. Drugs for human use ... are in development now and will be in FDA tests in several years. These will be available in five to ten years, not fifty."</p>
<p>Well, <em>The Singularity is Near</em> was published in 2005, so Kurzweil's deadline for this was 2015. According to the NHS website however, 1,316 gastrc band operations were performed in 2012 and today we still don't have a pill that you can take and then eat what you want. It would be unfair of me not to mention an article on Kurzweil's site: <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/imaginary-meal-tricks-the-body-into-losing-weight" target="_blank">http://www.kurzweilai.net/imaginary-meal-tricks-the-body-into-losing-weight</a> but this has only been tested in mice which Kurzweil even says on p11 had already been achieved. I'm sure Kurzweil would disagree, but if we're being honest, there is still no magic pill available that lets us eat what we want and not gain weight.</p>
<p>Prediction: False</p>
<h2>Page 105</h2>
<p>"By the end of this decade, computers will disappear as distinct physical objects, with displays built in our eyeglasses, and electronics woven in our clothing, providing full-immersion visual virtual reality. Thus, 'going to a Web site' will mean entering a virtual-reality environment - at least for the visual and auditory senses - where we can directly interact with products and people, both real and simulated. Although simulated people will not be up to human standards - at least not by 2009 - they will be quite satisfactory as sales agents, reservation clerks, and research assistants. Haptic (tactile) interfaces will enable us to touch products and people. It is difficult to identify any lasting advantage of the old brick-and-mortar world that will not ultimately be overcome by the rich interactive interfaces that are soon to come."</p>
<p>Did the above sound anything like your experience of 2009? Because it doesn't seem anything like my experience of 2017. There are a few separate claims here, let's break them down:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Computers will disappear in to clothes and eyeglasses."<br>Nope. Computers have become our smart phones though and we're no longer tied to desktops.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Going to a website will mean entering virtual reality."<br>In 2009, no. In 2017, it is possible that a tiny percentage (and we're talking &lt; 0.0001%) of websites use VR and probably a similar percentage of people have an Oculus, Vive, Google Cardboard, Gear VR or similar VR headset. There is a framework to allow developers to make VR websites called <a href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank">A-Frame</a> but it's definitely not in common use yet.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Virtual assistants will be satisfactory sales agents."<br>Nope, not in 2009 and not now in 2017. The closest we get is a live chat that is a bot, but as soon as the user realises they're not speaking to a real person, and that is pretty much after the very first question, they would usually rather just use a search or browse an FAQ.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"Touch interfaces will allow us to touch products and people."<br>Sure this has existed in labs for a long time, but do we use this even in 2017? Nope, not even close. Yet another fail for Kurzweil, if we're honest.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Page 312</h2>
<p>"Computers arriving at the beginning of the next decade will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment. They will tap into the worldwide mesh (what the World Wide Web will become once all of its linked devices become communicating Web servers, thereby forming vast supercomputers and memory banks) of high-speed communications and computational resources. We'll have very high-bandwidth, wireless communication to the Internet at all times. Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas."</p>
<ul>
<li>"Computers in clothing, furniture and the environment."<br>Well I have a Christmas jumper with flashing LEDs but I don't think that's what Kurzweil meant, and none of my furniture has a computer in it unless you count the Raspberry Pi on the shelf of my coffee table. As above, this one doesn't seem correct even in 2017. <p>Prediction: False</p></li>
<li>"A worldwide mesh will link all devices"<br>Many devices do connect to wifi and you can connect to their IP address to access a config page served by their web server, so this seems to be correct. <p>Prediction: True</p></li>
<li>"forming vast supercomputers and memory banks"<br>In the PDF linked to above, Kurzweil tries to claim he meant the Cloud, but actually I think it's clear from the text that he meant all devices that connect to the Internet will share their resources in terms of memory and processing power. While this probably will happen fairly soon in my opinion and I run the "<a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding @ Home</a>" software which donates spare processor time to scientists who are trying to solve cancer and Alzheimer's, and can run on a mobile device, this isn't in common use yet in 2017.<p>Prediction: False</p><p>[Update 2017-12-22]<br>Rather than a single standard for devices to share their computing resources, it might be that blockchain technology allows these resources to be shared safely and anonymously in return for a reward such as cash, cryptocurrency or the use of other resources. Some technologies now exist that share processing such as <a href="https://golem.network/" target="_blank">Golem</a> and storage such as <a href="https://sia.tech/" target="_blank">Sia</a>. If these became ubiquitous and ran on the majority of devices, the amount of computing power available would probably be many orders of magnitude greater than even the most powerful supercomputers in existence today. </p></li>
<li>"We'll have very high-bandwidth, wireless communication to the Internet at all times."<br>Correct! Indeed we do, and we use it so much that it's hard to remember that in 2005, we didn't have this.<p>Prediction: True</p></li>
<li>"Displays will be built into our eyeglasses and contact lenses and images projected directly onto our retinas."<br>Also discussed above, this one seems way off.<p>Prediction: False</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Still talking about "The 2010 Scenario", Kurzweil continues on page 313:</h2>
<p>"These resources will …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Elroy is a table lamp with a unique feature — the shade can dynamically change, at the swipe of a finger, to a new style or pattern to complement your mood, the time of day, or an event, all from your phone or web browser.</span></p>
<p><span>Elroy is a concept and personal DIY project. I’ll share some learnings and details on how I built it. These aren’t step-by-step instructions, but I hope they’ll be helpful to anyone that’s inspired to build their own design.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/elroy-lamp-4c_moment-5/"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="295" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Elroy-Lamp-4c_Moment-5.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><span>Elroy is essentially a computer with a 4-way display, backlit by a bright LED bulb. The four sides of the lamp shade are made from translucent LCD displays, and acrylic and paper diffusion layers. The light source is a very bright 35W LED bulb. The displays are driven by a single board computer running Linux and custom software to display and manage images. The lamp is controllable over wifi via a simple web app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Translucent LCDs</strong></h3>
<p><span>I salvaged some 13” LCD displays from old laptops and found additional matching displays on ebay. I disassembled each display, removing the frame, backing layer, diffusion film, and backlight. This took some practice to get right. The LCD glass is quite fragile. I broke 2 panels during disassembly and had to find replacements. The trick is to remove the electrical tape that holds the display together without flexing the LCD glass so much that it cracks.</span></p>

From top: 1) A shiny white paper layer to reflect the back light 2) a transparent polycarbonate sheet with a film to scatter the back light 3) a stack of different diffusion films 4) metal frame 5) the LCD glass panel with circuit board.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-711"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_184315-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-711">The backlight is a row of super bright LEDs tucked into a channel in the metal frame. Some other LCD panels use a cold florescent tube instead of LEDs.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The remaining LCD panel is translucent: LCD displays are a sandwich of transparent glass embedded with liquid crystals and tiny transistors, surrounded by layers of polarizing film. In the photo below, I wrote a message on a piece of letter paper, placed it on a clear piece of acrylic, on top of a bright backlight. You can see the LCD display on the right is translucent, but similar to a pair of sunglasses, the polarizing film only permits a fraction of the backlight to emit through the panel.</span></p>

<p><span>Polarizing film is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display"><span>necessary for the function of an LCD display</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Lamp Light &amp; Diffusion</strong></h3>
<p><span>Given the low amount of light emitted through the display, to create a sufficiently bright lamp, a very bright light source is needed. Also, though an LCD display is typically backlit by a light with a cold color temperature (around 5000K), lamp light is typically a warm color temperature (like 2700K). So the ideal bulb must be bright and warm.</span></p>

<p><span>I experimented with multi-bulb arrays, and different bulb options, but settled on this 35W (300W equiv) LED bulb. This bulb is giant and takes up quite a bit of space within the shade. It’s bright enough that it shouldn’t be directly exposed — it would be uncomfortable (maybe dangerous?) to look at directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, without some work, the light from the bulb, when viewed through the LCD panels, would be a harsh point-light concentrated in the center. </span><span>I wanted to diffuse the light evenly across the surface and produce a textured, fabric-like aesthetic. I experimented with different acrylic and polycarbonate sheets and paper materials.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s one experiment result I really liked, but didn’t end up using. This is mulberry paper, which has a unique texture that’s simultaneously woody and linen-like, has nice diffusion properties, and transmits a lot of light. This looked great with black and white patterns and particularly complemented a Japanese lantern aesthetic. I felt like the large and non-uniform fibers didn’t work as well with a diverse set of patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>I found the best combination was this sandwich (starting from the inside):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Frosted acrylic 1/8″ 90% emission (film facing out)</span></li>
<li><span>Vellum tracing paper</span></li>
<li><span>LCD</span></li>
<li><span>Rice paper</span></li>
<li><span>Clear anti-glare polycarbonate 3/32”</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>The acrylic and polycarbonate sheets also add some structure to protect the LCD glass from flexing and breaking. I wrapped the edges of each sandwich in acetate cloth electrical tape to keep the sheets together.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Controlling</strong></h3>
<p><span>I needed a small SBC (single-board computer), capable of driving 4 displays. I happened to have an Nvidia Jetson Nano, which has DisplayPort 1.2 output with support for MST (multi-stream transport), which means it’s able to drive multiple displays. The Jetson Nano is a powerful, tiny computer that operates on 5V power and can run a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.</span></p>

<p><span>I wrote some custom software based on </span><a href="https://www.pygame.org/"><span>Pygame</span></a><span> to display images, with a simple web app and server to give me control over the images.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="409" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-294x300.jpg 294w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-768x785.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_-1002x1024.jpg 1002w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71ID5ujheuL._AC_SL1500_.jpg 1468w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p><span>The LCD panels take EDP (Embedded DisplayPort) video input. Each display required an adapter from DisplayPort to EDP. These adapters are bulky and have a lot of functionality I didn’t actually need, like 12V power and brightness control for a backlight (which I removed from each panel) and a control interface for display settings. I also needed an MST Hub to break out 4 DP ports from the 1 DP port on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. This configuration is something I think I could make cheaper and more compact in a future revision, but it worked great for this concept.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Woodwork</strong></h3>
<p><span>I designed the lamp structure in Rhino3D and chose to make wooden parts from walnut. This makes the shade rather heavy, but the lamp is stable with the walnut base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-692"><a href="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/img_20190608_172549/" rel="attachment wp-att-692"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20190608_172549-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-692">The shade frame, glued-up, sanded, and ready to stain.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>I cut all parts for the shade and base, then shaped them on a router table. I’m not an experienced woodworker, but this came together pretty easily. I had an adventure making tongue-and-groove joints for the first time. This is the 3rd time I’ve used walnut for a project and I always like the result.</span></p>
<p><span>The side-edges of the frame have brass threaded inserts that enable the top and bottom to attach via M2 machine screws.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3D Printed Parts</strong></h3>
<p><span>Most of the electronic components, including the power supply, SBC, MST Hub, switches, and wiring are mounted in a 4.5” square 3D printed “sleeve” that fits inside the walnut base. There is also a vented platform that connects the sleeve to the bottom of the shade.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_696" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-696"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-1024x780.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="400" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-1024x780.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform-768x585.jpg 768w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sleeves-and-platform.jpg 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-696">Drawing of sleeve and vented platform.

<figure id="attachment_716" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-716"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="394" srcset="https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.kylescholz.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191106_180712-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-716">The sleeve, ready to insert into the walnut base. I primed and painted the 3D printed sleeve. Only the top 2 inches is visible when the lamp is assembled, so the rough spots here aren’t a problem.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>If I were building this lamp for production … or if I had access to the right tools, I’d want to make the sleeve and platform out of sheet metal to improve heat dissipation.</span></p>
<p><span>On top of the shade, I added a louvered cover. This enables the shade to emit additional light from the top, while obscuring the bulb, which is too bright to look at directly. This also permits heat to escape. I printed these parts out of translucent PETG, which has a higher plasticization temperature than some other common 3D printing filament materials. This isn’t strictly necessary because the surface temperature of the bulb doesn’t really get that hot. Even after hours of continuous use, the temperate is &lt;130 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Making it better</strong></h3>
<p><span>This lamp is mostly a proof of concept, but it works and looks good enough that I plan to keep it and use it. If I make another, I have a few ideas for improvement.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sheet metal. Replace the 3D printed sleeve and vented platform with sheet metal to help dissipate heat.</span></li>
<li><span>Replace the DisplayPort MST hub and adapters. These take up a lot of space and add significant expense (~$250 for the hub and 4 adapters). One theoretical alternative is a DisplayLink adapter based on the </span><a href="https://www.displaylink.com/integrated-chipsets/dl-4000"><span>DL-4100</span></a><span>, which would drive displays over USB and support EDP. I haven’t been able to find such a device on the market yet. Another option to drive displays from USB3 would be to use an SBC with Displayport Alt Mode. I would still need to adapt Displayport to eDP. Adapter boards that do this are bulky and have a lot of components because they provide power and control to the backlight. Since I’m not using a backlight, I could make a simpler adapter that just maps pins for the different connectors.</span></li>
<li><span>Finally, reconsider the closed frame design. Elroy’s shade is basically a closed box. I made this choice&nbsp; to obscure the bulb and hide some electronic components like the EDP ribbon cables and adapters. An open frame design might be possible. One idea is to backlight the panels with edge lighting so I can reduce or eliminate the high wattage bulb.</span></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This week, we close out our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, IVb) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, although I ought to note that there will be at least one addendum discussing pre-modern cast iron and crucible steel (Wootz) production.  Last week, we looked at the processes used to create steel from iron by introducing carbon (rather than the modern method of producing steel from pig iron by <em>removing</em> carbon).  That process changes the characteristics of the metal, since steel is harder and more elastic (bending and springing back, rather than bending and staying bent) than iron.</p>



<p>But the chemical composition of the iron or steel isn’t the only factor in determining its hardness and ductility: mechanical processes and heat treatment also alter the internal structure of the metal.  Since the pre-modern blacksmith works with both of these – mechanical processes through hammer and heat through the ‘heats’ of forging – he cannot afford to disregard the changes that both bring.  As we noted in part III, the blacksmith’s job is not merely to bring the metal into the necessary <em>shape</em> for its final application, he also has to get it there with the right <em>characteristics</em> – the correct balance of hardness, strength, ductility and elasticity to get the job done, whatever that job might be.</p>



<p>And I should note again that different tools – and indeed, different parts of the same tool – might have very different demands in this regard.  Metal files needed to be prodigiously hard so that they could abrade already quite hard materials.  The tips of chisels and picks also needed to be very hard, to keep their shape under repeated impacts, but not so hard that they broke; some ductility to absorb the energy of impact was needed.  Armor needed typically to only be somewhat hardened (though demands of this sort get higher with gunpowder) and can be fairly malleable; the armor plate that deforms elastically on impact still absorbs the strike.  Swords made varied demands: their significant length demanded strong steel with good elasticity to be able to spring back into proper shape after absorbing the forces of swings and impacts, while keeping a good cutting edge demanded a high degree of hardness (hardness being the characteristic that determines how sharp an edge can be and also how well that sharpness can be held during use).</p>



<p>So a blacksmith couldn’t simply maximize one trait at the expense of the others. Nor could they have just one kind of steel, with just one set of characteristics for every application.  Rather the learned techniques – copied and practiced during their apprenticeship – were developed, probably over generations, by experimentation to produce tools, weapons and armor each with its own unique ‘right blend’ of characteristics, though two major methods we will discuss today (along with, of course, carbon content, which we discussed last week).</p>

<h2>Work Hardening</h2>



<p><strong>Work hardening</strong> refers to the tendency of metals, when hammered (or strained into any kind of plastic deformation) to become harder.  In its pristine state, the atoms of a metal are generally arranged in a crystal structure, joined by metallic bonds.  These lattices of atoms are neat and regular.  When that neat, regular lattice of atoms is strained, resulting in plastic (rather than elastic) deformation, those neat regular lattices get scrunched and bent and otherwise dislocated.  This happens in iron, but also in most metals – indeed, work hardening is <em>much more</em> important in bronze-work than it is in iron-work, though it cannot be neglected in either.</p>



<p>That dislocation makes the metal resistant to further deformation (plastic <em>or</em> elastic), both increasing the hardness of the metal and its yield strength (the amount of energy you need to apply for plastic, rather than elastic deformation to take place), but at the same time makes the metal less malleable and more brittle (that is, more likely to break than bend).  This is a property that must have been apparent to the earliest copper-smiths: as they hammered their copper into shape, each blow made the metal slightly more resistant to hammering, until eventually it would refuse to budge almost completely (and possibly break instead).  But the same process works for iron, though because of the different production process for iron, it has to be a touch more intentional.</p>



<p>It is possible to reset this process through a process called <strong>annealing</strong>.  When a work hardened metal is heated up, the energy provided by the heat allows the atoms to break and reform their bonds, causing the crystal structure to return to its normal lattice and removing the various dislocations (while retaining its new shape).  To completely anneal iron, it is heated up to its annealing temperature (which varies based on the carbon content, as you can see in the chart below) and held there for an extended period, which will cause it to get a soft as possible for the given iron and carbon content.  This can be very handy if the iron needs to be cold worked (see below).</p>

<p>If the iron is not held at the high temperature, but is allowed to cool slowly in the air, it is said to be <em>normalized</em> (this process, <em><strong>normalization</strong></em>, is a subset of annealing).  As with full annealing, the heating process works out all of the little strains in metal (heats for this process range from 700 to 900°C), but by cooling it slowly afterwards (rather than holding it at a high temperature), it causes the actual size of the atomic lattice of the metal to shrink (the technical term is ‘grain refinement’ as the individual grains of the lattice are ‘refined’ – meaning ‘get smaller’), which results in a metal <em>somewhat</em> harder than in a fully annealed state.  Normalization is an important step for metal that is going to be subsequently heat treated as well.</p>



<p>Now the attentive reader will be thinking, “but wait, if heating the metal up to forging heat and letting it cool in the air resets the work hardening process – well, we’re doing that every time we heat the metal for forging.”  Indeed!  <strong>Hot</strong> <strong>working </strong>(which is what we’ve been describing so far with forging) generally does not meaningfully work harden metal for this very reason.  And for a smith working with good steel that is going to be <em>heat treated</em> (which we’ll discuss in a minute) this doesn’t matter a whole lot.  </p>



<p>But – for reasons which we’ll discuss – iron with very low carbon contents <em>cannot</em> be heat treated for hardness.  <strong>For a smith working with nearly pure (no carbon) iron, work hardening is his best option for increasing hardness and yield strength.</strong>  In this case, the iron object would typically be brought essentially to its final shape and then finished by being hammered <em>cold</em> (‘<strong>cold working</strong>‘).  While copper and bronze are generally soft enough to be almost entirely cold worked, iron really isn’t, except in fairly thin sheets, so the bulk of the actual <em>shaping</em> will still be done with hot forging, but with a final phase of cold hammering which will induce work hardening (and also, incidentally, can remove tool marks from the hot working, which might be cosmetically desirable).</p>



<h2>Heat Treatment Basics</h2>



<p>The changes steel undergoes when it is heated and cools can also alter its characteristics.  Because, as we’ll see, a big part of the effect of heat treatment has to do with the carbon atoms diffused within the crystalline iron structure of steel, pure iron and low carbon steel cannot be effectively heat treated and has to instead be work hardened in order to achieve similar results.  Heat treatment allows the blacksmith fairly fine control over the hardness, strength and ductility of the steel and can even allow for different parts of a single steel object to be hardened to different degrees.</p>



<p>For high-carbon steel, the heat treatment cycle is often called ‘tempering and quenching’ although as we’ll see it would perhaps be more accurate to call the process <em><strong>hardening, quenching and tempering</strong></em> (and then quenching one more time) to get the correct order.  It is something of an irony that first, intense <em>quenching</em> of raw, red-hot steel (the second quenching is much less dramatic as it occurs at much lower temperatures) – almost always shown as the <em>final</em> step in blacksmithing in film or video games – is essentially never the final step, for reasons that will soon become apparent.</p>



<p>First, some complicated metallurgy and then we’ll get to the actual real world processes a blacksmith would use.  High carbon steel is initially a mix of two kinds of iron, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_iron"><strong>ferrite</strong> </a>and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cementite">cementite</a></strong>, the former being a cubic atomic structure of pure iron, whereas the later is an iron-carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C for the curious).  If that steel is heated above 912°C (but not melted), something interesting starts to happen: the ferrite structure changes into <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenite">austenite</a></strong>.  Avoiding the deep weeds of metallurgy here, all we need to know is that austenite is a <em>different</em> cube of iron that is able to absorb carbon atoms, pulling them out of the cementite and trapping them inside the individual austentite structures.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language select-able on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>There have been three versions of UNIX. The earliest version (circa 1969–70) ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers. The second version ran on the unprotected PDP-11/20 computer. This paper describes only the PDP-11/40 and /45 [l] system since it is more modern and many of the differences between it and older UNIX systems result from redesign of features found to be deficient or lacking.</p>

<p>Since PDP-11 UNIX became operational in February 1971, about 40 installations have been put into service; they are generally smaller than the system described here. Most of them are engaged in applications such as the preparation and formatting of patent applications and other textual material, the collection and processing of trouble data from various switching machines within the Bell System, and recording and checking telephone service orders. Our own installation is used mainly for research in operating systems, languages, computer networks, and other topics in computer science, and also for document preparation.</p>

<p>Perhaps <mark>the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort</mark>: UNIX can run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and less than two man years were spent on the main system software. Yet UNIX contains a number of features seldom offered even in much larger systems. <mark>It is hoped, however, the users of UNIX will find that the most important characteristics of the system are its simplicity, elegance, and ease of use.</mark></p>

<p>Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED[2], linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL[3] with types and structures (C), interpreter for a dialect of BASIC, text formatting program, Fortran compiler, Snobol interpreter, top-down compiler-compiler (TMG) [4], bottom-up compiler-compiler (YACC), form letter generator, macro processor (M6) [5], and permuted index program.</p>

<p>There is also a host of maintenance, utility, recreation, and novelty programs. All of these programs were written locally. It is worth noting that the system is totally self-supporting. All UNIX software is maintained under UNIX; likewise, UNIX documents are generated and formatted by the UNIX editor and text formatting program.</p>

<h2 id="2-hardware-and-software-environment">2. Hardware and Software Environment</h2>

<p>The PDP-11/45 on which our UNIX installation is implemented is a 16-bit word (8-bit byte) computer with 144 Kbytes of core memory; UNIX occupies 42K bytes. This system, however, includes a very large number of device drivers and enjoys a generous allotment of space for I/O buffers and system tables; a minimal system capable of running the software mentioned above can require as little as 50K bytes of core altogether.</p>

<p>The PDP-11 has a 1M byte fixed-head disk, used for filesystem storage and swapping, four moving-head disk drives which each provide 2.5M bytes on removable disk cartridges, and a single moving-head disk drive which uses removable 40M byte disk packs. There are also a high-speed paper tape reader-punch, nine-track magnetic tape,and D-tape (a variety of magnetic tape facility in which individual records may be addressed and rewritten). Besides the console typewriter, there are 14 variable-speed communications interfaces attached to 100-series datasets and a 201 dataset interface used primarily for spooling printout to a communal line printer. There are also several one-of-a-kind devices including a Picturephone® interface,a voice response unit, a voice synthesizer, a phototypesetter, a digital switching network, and a satellite PDP-11/20 which generates vectors, curves, and characters on a Tektronix 611 storage-tube display.</p>

<p>The greater part of UNIX software is written in the above-mentioned C language [6]. Early versions of the operating system were written in assembly language, but during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C. The size of the new system is about one third greater than the old. Since the new system is not only much easier to understand and to modify but also includes many functional improvements, including multiprogramming and the ability to share reentrant code among several user programs, we considered this increase in size quite acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-file-system">3. The File System</h2>

<p><span>
 S: Note how the paper considers files important. Unix exposes all the functionality through files.
</span></p>

<p>The most important job of UNIX is to provide a file system. From the point of view of the user, there are three kinds of files: ordinary disk files, directories, and special files</p>

<h3 id="31-ordinary-files">3.1 Ordinary Files</h3>

<p><mark>A file contains whatever information the user places on it, for example symbolic or binary (object) programs. No particular structuring is expected by the system.</mark> Files of text consist simply of a string of characters, with lines demarcated by the new-line character. Binary programs are sequences of words as they will appear in core memory when the program starts executing. A few user programs manipulate files with more structure: the assembler generates and the loader expects an object file in a particular format. However, the structure of files is controlled by the programs which use them, not by the system.</p>

<h3 id="32-directories">3.2 Directories</h3>

<p><mark>Directories provide the mapping between the names of files and the files themselves, and thus induce a structure on the file system as a whole.</mark> Each user has a directory of his own files; he may also create subdirectories to contain groups of files conveniently treated together. A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it cannot be written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system controls the contents of directories. However, anyone with appropriate permission may read a directory just like any other file.</p>

<p>The system maintains several directories for its own use. One of these is the <em>root</em> directory. All files in the system can be found by tracing a path through a chain of directories until the desired file is reached. The starting point for such searches is often the root. Another system directory contains all the programs provided for general use; that is, all the <em>commands</em>. As will be seen however, it is by no means necessary that a program reside in this directory for it to be executed.</p>

<p><span>
 S: This is a succinct description of path system of unix and Linux
</span></p>

<p>Files are named by sequences of 14 or fewer characters. When the name of a file is specified to the system, it may be in the form of a <em>path name</em>, which is a sequence of directory names separated by slashes <code>/</code> and ending in a file name. If the sequence begins with a slash, the search begins in the root directory. The name <code>/alpha/beta/gamma</code> causes the system to search the root for directory <code>alpha</code>, then to search <code>alpha</code> for <code>beta</code>, finally to find <code>gamma</code> in <code>beta</code>. <code>gamma</code> may be an ordinary file, a directory, or a special file. As a limiting case, the name <code>/</code> refers to the root itself.</p>

<p>A path name not starting with <code>/</code> causes the system to begin the search in the user’s current directory. Thus, the name <code>alpha/beta</code> specifies the file named <code>beta</code> in subdirectory <code>alpha</code> of the current directory. The simplest kind of name, for example <code>alpha</code>, refers to a file which itself is found in the current directory. As another limiting case, the null file name refers to the current directory.</p>

<p>The same nondirectory file may appear in several directories under possibly different names. This feature is called <em>linking</em>; a directory entry for a file is sometimes called a link. <mark>UNIX differs from other systems in which linking is permitted in that all links to a file have equal status.</mark> That is, a file does not exist within a particular directory; the directory entry for a file consists merely of its name and a pointer to the information actually describing the file. Thus a file exists independently of any directory entry, although in practice a file is made to disappear along with the last link to it.</p>

<p>Each directory always has at least two entries. The name in each directory refers to the directory itself. Thus a program may read the current directory under the name <code>.</code> without knowing its complete path name. The name <code>..</code> by convention refers to the parent of the directory in which it appears, that is, to the directory in which it was created.</p>

<p><mark>The directory structure is constrained to have the form of a rooted tree.</mark> Except for the special entries <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>, each directory must appear as an entry in exactly one other,which is its parent. Te reason for this is to simplify the writing of programs which visit subtrees of the directory structure, and more important, to avoid the separation of portions of the hierarchy. If arbitrary links to directories were permitted, it would be quite difficult to detect when the last connection from the root to a directory was severed.</p>

<h3 id="33-special-files">3.3 Special Files</h3>

<p><mark>Special files constitute the most unusual feature of the UNIX file system. Each …</mark></p></section></div>

       <p>We live in times of great disaggregation, and yet, seem to learn increasingly from generalists.</p>
<p>In the past, an expert in one field of Psychology might have been forced to teach a broad survey class. Today, you could have each lecture delivered by the world’s leading expert.</p>
<p>Outside of academia, you might follow one writer’s account to learn about SaaS pricing, another to understand the intricacies of the electoral college, and yet another to understand personal finance. In economic terms, content disaggregation enabled by digital platforms ought to create efficiencies through intellectual hyper-specialization.</p>
<p>Instead, we have the endless hellscape of the casual polymath. A newsletter about venture capital will find time to opine on herd immunity. The tech blog you visit to learn about data science is also your source of financial strategies for early retirement. The Twitter account you followed to understand politics now seems more focused on their mindfulness practice. We have maxed out variety of interests within people, at the cost of diversity across them.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to imagine how this happened. The flip side of disaggregation is that each would-be expert is able to read broadly as well. The world of atomized content through hyper-specialization isn’t a stable equilibrium. We are all casual polymaths now.</p>
<p>As romantic as the idea seems, I worry it’s grossly suboptimal. Sure, there are cases where combining ideas from disparate fields can lead to new insight, but today’s generalists are not curating a portfolio of skills so much as they are stumbling about. <strong>Behavioral Econ is the love child of economics and psychology, early AI researchers maintained a serious interest in cognitive science. What exactly are your cursory interests in space exploration, meta-science and bayesian statistics preparing you for?</strong></p>
<p>I understand that we can sometimes only “connect the dots looking backwards”. Perhaps there is valuable work in a statistical meta-analysis of aerospace research. But that’s only true if you’re going into some degree of depth in each field.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to dissuade you from becoming a polymath, just to be a little more distrustful of others who claim to be.</p>

As his father would later remark: “With the money I spent, I could have elected my chauffeur.”</p>
<p>If you saw JFK in 1947, you might have thought “wow, he’s rich, his father was the Chairman of the SEC, and he’s a member of the US House of Representatives, what an impressive guy!” A decade later, you could have added “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiles_in_Courage">Pulitzer Prize winning author</a>“ to that list.</p>
<p>But this reasoning is totally backwards. JFK was only able to become a politician because of his wealth. In fact, his father only became SEC Chairman after extensive political donations to FDR. And obviously, his book was ghost-written by his speechwriter.</p>
<p>So you’re justified in being impressed by exactly one accomplishment, and everything else ought to be discounted.</p>
<p>We already understand this intuitively, but only in a limited set of cases. If a pop star becomes an actor, we are not impressed by their wide range of talents. Instead, we understand that popularity is a semi-fungible good.</p>

Polymaths are abusing Gell-Mann Amnesia</h4><p>As I wrote <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/17/markets-nasa/">earlier</a>:<br><em>You go on Twitter, you read someone’s tweet on a subject you know something about, and see that the author has no understanding of the facts. So you keep scrolling and read their tweets about cancel culture, space exploration and criminal justice reform, totally forgetting how wrong they were before.</em></p>
<p><em>In this sense, every tweet is an option with asymmetric returns. If you’re right, you cash out; if you’re wrong, everyone forgets and you lose nothing. The incentive is to ramp up variance, make bold claims in a variety of areas, and hope you’re right some of the time.</em></p>
<p>Accordingly, authors will make bold claims in a variety of areas, and you may be inclined to believe them even after seeing how wrong they are. Unless you are also a polymath, and a polymath in the same domains, you will probably not be capable of evaluating their competence.</p>
<p>Of course, you might rely on external opinions, which brings us to the last point.</p>
<h4 id="3-Polymaths-are-evaluated-by-non-polymaths"><a href="#3-Polymaths-are-evaluated-by-non-polymaths" title="3. Polymaths are evaluated by non-polymaths"></a>3. Polymaths are evaluated by non-polymaths</h4><p>Leonardo da Vinci is the most famous polymath of all time and the model omni-competent Renaissance Man.</p>
<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci also didn’t know math.</strong> Issacson’s book details numerous episodes in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leonardo comes up with a million dollar business idea, later realizes his basic arithmetic was off by more than an order of magnitude.</li>
<li>Leonardo claims to be a military engineer to gain acceptance at the Milanese court. In fact, he has never built any kind of weapon or siege device.</li>
<li>Leonardo claims to have solved the ancient puzzle of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube">doubling the cube</a>. Except his “solution” only works if you can’t tell the difference between the square root of 3 and cube root of 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last example is especially notable because Issacson himself doesn’t seem to catch it, instead uncritically praising Leonardo’s discovery. [Details in Appendix]</p>
<p>And yet <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Wikipedia writes</a>:<br><em>…many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the “Renaissance Man” or “Universal Genius”, an individual of “unquenchable curiosity” and “feverishly inventive imagination.”[6] He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived.[10] According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history</em></p>
<p>Of course <strong>the inflation of his mathematical and engineering ability makes sense when you consider the that judges in question are predominantly art historians</strong>. Rather than as a Renaissance Man, Leonardo would be better regarded as an exceptional painter with various hobbies.</p>
<hr>
<p>While an expert in one domain may just be a savant with a “kooky knack”, mastering multiple unrelated skills feels like evidence of general intelligence, or in Leonardo’s case, “Universal Genius”. If someone is good at computer science, epidemiology and finance, surely we can trust their opinion on politics as well?</p>
<p>Except what’s really happening is that we’ve chosen to privilege certain combinations of skills as impressive, while taking others for granted.</p>
<p>A physicist who studies math, can write code for analysis and understand complex systems is not hailed as a polymath. They’re just seen as obtaining the basic set of skills required for their profession. Similarly, a basketball player who can run, shoot and block is not any kind of “polymath”.</p>
<p>You might object that this is because physics and basketball are specific clusters of skills. Running quickly is more closely related to throwing a ball than software engineering is to epidemiology.</p>
<p>This might be true in specific cases, but in general, it’s a coincidence of which skills cluster into occupations. A small business owner who manages their own books, handles sales and manufactures their product is not considered a polymath, no matter how distinct those fields might be. Computational social scientists are not considered polymaths, neither is an OnlyFans creator who single handedly runs everything from marketing to modeling, nor a translator who has to master ancient greek, dive deeply into historical context, and also be a great poet in their own right.</p>
<hr>
<p>To be clear, there are still good reasons to learn a variety of skills. As Marc Andreessen <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html">put it</a>:<br><em>All successful CEO’s [sic] are like this. They are almost never the best product visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best finance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25% in some set of those skills, and then all of a sudden they’re qualified to actually run something important.</em></p>
<p>He goes on to provide examples, listing Communication, Management, Sales, Finance and International Experience.</p>
<p>I’m broadly in agreement. Learning these skills will probably benefit your career. Just understand that no one has ever been hailed as a polymath because they’re good at both communication and management. They’re just considered basically competent at their job.</p>
<p>I don’t want to dissuade anyone from learning broadly and reading widely. Of course athletes should cross train, and intellectuals should read outside their domain, and software engineers might benefit from public speaking classes.</p>
<p>My point is that we should not trust or glorify people on the basis of their apparent “Universal Genius”. Having a variety of interests is no more a sign of generalized intelligence than being able to walk and chew gum. And if someone does appear to have accomplishments in a variety of domains with fungible currency, their total status should not be a sum or multiple, but merely the status of their single most impressive feat.</p>
<p>So go read your SaaS/Meta-Science/Aerospace blog and revel in the genuine joy of intellectual curiosity. As Tyler Cowen would say, I’m just here to lower the status of polymaths.</p>
<h2 id="Appendix-Doubling-the-Cube"><a href="#Appendix-Doubling-the-Cube" title="Appendix: Doubling the Cube"></a>Appendix: Doubling the Cube</h2><p>Here’s the full quote from Issacson:<br><em>These obsessions led Leonardo to an ancient riddle described by Vitruvius, Euripides, and others. Faced with a plague in the fifth century BC, the citizens of Delos consulted the oracle of Delphi. They were told that the plague would end if they found a mathematical way to precisely double the size of the altar to Apollo, which was shaped as a cube. When they doubled the length of each side, the plague worsened; the Oracle explained that by doing so they had increased the size of the cube eightfold rather than doubling it. (For example, a cube with two-foot sizes has eight times the volume of a cube with one-foot sides.) To solve the problem geometrically required multiplying the length of each side by the cube root of 2.</em></p>

I thought Iâ€™d throw them out here to see which ones the wise crowd here think are most likely. Bonus points if you come up with some new ones. Gold stars if you can rule some out based on exÂ­istÂ­ing data or can proÂ­pose tests by which they might be renÂ­dered more or less plauÂ­siÂ­ble.</p><p>The hyÂ­potheÂ­ses come in two broad famÂ­iÂ­lies: 1) my feelÂ­ing that stupid is exÂ­pandÂ­ing is an illuÂ­sion or misÂ­perÂ­cepÂ­tion, and 2) stupid is exÂ­pandÂ­ing and here is why:</p><ol><li><p>I have beÂ­come more atÂ­tuned to stuÂ­pidity for [reaÂ­sons], so even though there is no more of it than usual, it stands out more to me.

ToÂ­day the culÂ­tural beaÂ­cons of reÂ­spectable idiocy have been overÂ­thrown and there is inÂ­creasÂ­ing diÂ­verÂ­sity in foolÂ­ishÂ­ness. DiverÂ­gent fools seem more foolÂ­ish to each other when in fact weâ€™re all just as stupid as weâ€™ve always been.</p></li><li><p>Iâ€™m runÂ­ning in stupiÂ­der cirÂ­cles than I used to for some reaÂ­son, while in genÂ­eral things havenâ€™t changed much.</p></li><li><p>I am the one getÂ­ting stupiÂ­der, or was stupid all along, and so I donâ€™t have the cogÂ­niÂ­tive strength to acÂ­cuÂ­rately judge the stuÂ­pidity level around me, and just hapÂ­pen to be thinkÂ­ing it is getÂ­ting worse beÂ­cause I donâ€™t know any betÂ­ter. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">DunÂ­ning-Kruger effect</a>)</p></li><li><p>PeoÂ­ple arenâ€™t getÂ­ting any stupiÂ­der, itâ€™s just that the arÂ­tifiÂ­cial inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gence of the bots Iâ€™m misÂ­takÂ­ing for peoÂ­ple on-line isnâ€™t all that good yet.</p></li><li><p>Theyâ€™re not getÂ­ting stupiÂ­der; Iâ€™m just getÂ­ting more conÂ­ceited.</p></li><li><p>PeoÂ­ple orÂ­diÂ­narÂ­ily use differÂ­ent modes of thinkÂ­ing in differÂ­ent comÂ­muÂ­niÂ­caÂ­tions conÂ­texts. In some, findÂ­ing the truth is imÂ­porÂ­tant and so they use raÂ­tioÂ­nal inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gence. In othÂ­ers, decÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tive disÂ­play, ritÂ­ual, asÂ­sertÂ­ing domÂ­iÂ­nance or subÂ­misÂ­sion, disÂ­playÂ­ing tribal alleÂ­giances, etc. are more imÂ­porÂ­tant and so they use modes more apÂ­proÂ­priÂ­ate to those things. Itâ€™s not that peoÂ­ple are getÂ­ting stupiÂ­der, but that these non-inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gent forms of comÂ­muÂ­niÂ­caÂ­tion (a) are more amÂ­plified than they used to be, (b) more comÂ­monly pracÂ­ticed than they used to be, or (c) are more promiÂ­nent where I hapÂ­pen to be trainÂ­ing my atÂ­tenÂ­tion.</p></li><li><p>I am acÂ­quiring greater wisÂ­dom with age as I ought, but the avÂ­erÂ­age age of the typÂ­iÂ­cal perÂ­son I enÂ­counter stays the same so they canÂ­not keep up.

Just as lanÂ­guage, muÂ­sic, art changes over time, so does thinkÂ­ing.

What Iâ€™ve been inÂ­terÂ­pretÂ­ing as truth and raÂ­tioÂ­nalÂ­ity has been my own atÂ­tempt to alÂ­ign my thinkÂ­ing with the poliÂ­tiÂ­cal clique that was in power when I was beÂ­ing edÂ­uÂ­cated. What Iâ€™m inÂ­terÂ­pretÂ­ing as risÂ­ing stuÂ­pidity has been the colÂ­lapse in power and staÂ­tus of that clique and the poliÂ­tiÂ­cal obÂ­soÂ­lesÂ­cence of the vaÂ­riÂ­ety of â€œtruthâ€� and â€œraÂ­tioÂ­nalÂ­ityâ€� I inÂ­terÂ­nalÂ­ized as a child. Those pomo philosoÂ­phers were right all along.</p></li><li><p>StuÂ­pidity doesnâ€™t have stayÂ­ing power, relÂ­aÂ­tive to non-stuÂ­pidity: thereâ€™s a sort of surÂ­vival of the fittest in which vast amounts of exÂ­presÂ­sions are beÂ­ing proÂ­duced all the time, most of which are stupid and fall away, but the ones that arenâ€™t stupid are more likely to surÂ­vive in memÂ­ory and to be mainÂ­tained in the hisÂ­torÂ­iÂ­cal record. This biÂ­ases things to make it apÂ­pear that the proÂ­porÂ­tion of non-stupid exÂ­presÂ­sions was lower in the past than it reÂ­ally was.</p></li><li><p>PoliÂ­tics and conÂ­sumer capÂ­iÂ­talÂ­ism are moÂ­tiÂ­vated to idenÂ­tify and tarÂ­get stupid peoÂ­ple so as to take adÂ­vanÂ­tage of them, so they have creÂ­ated sysÂ­tems that enÂ­courage stupid peoÂ­ple to self-idenÂ­tify and make themÂ­selves promiÂ­nent so that they can be picked off; that Iâ€™m noticÂ­ing this is just a side effect.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>PeoÂ­ple have given up tryÂ­ing to unÂ­derÂ­stand things in this messed-up timeline and are just rolÂ­ling with it; itâ€™s a sort of inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual learned helÂ­plessÂ­ness that apÂ­pears as exÂ­pandÂ­ing stuÂ­pidity.</p></li><li><p>StuÂ­pidity has its fashÂ­ions, and the latÂ­est fashÂ­ions are more in-your-face than they used to be.</p></li><li><p>PharÂ­maÂ­ceuÂ­tiÂ­cals that have beÂ­come popÂ­uÂ­lar in reÂ­cent decades have cogÂ­niÂ­tive side effects that are difficult to meaÂ­sure in the inÂ­diÂ­viÂ­dÂ­ual but cause noÂ­ticeÂ­able effects in the agÂ­greÂ­gate.</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly someÂ­thing in our diet, for exÂ­amÂ­pleâ€¦</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly all that exÂ­tra CO<sub>2</sub> in the atÂ­moÂ­sphere.</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly toxÂ­oÂ­plasÂ­moÂ­sis meow.</p></li><li><p>Itâ€™s real, and itâ€™s probÂ­aÂ­bly some other sort of change in our maÂ­teÂ­rial enÂ­viÂ­ronÂ­ment (exÂ­cludÂ­ing culÂ­tural changes).</p></li><li><p>Back in the day, when a perÂ­son had a stupid idea, they would be reÂ­lucÂ­tant to put it forÂ­ward as their own. Rather, they would wait to see if someÂ­one else would voice the idea so they could just agree with it. This used to be relÂ­aÂ­tively rare, but now you just have to google â€œ[my stupid idea]â€� to find that someÂ­one or other has said it first, and then youâ€™re off to the races.</p></li><li><p>If you have a smart idea, you may also be smart enough to reÂ­alÂ­ize that itâ€™s not useÂ­ful right now /â€‹ has already been betÂ­ter said /â€‹ is inÂ­apÂ­proÂ­priÂ­ate in conÂ­text. If you have a dumb idea, such thoughts may be less likely to ocÂ­cur to you due to the aura of dumbth that surÂ­rounds the dumb idea and reÂ­pels senÂ­siÂ­ble conÂ­sidÂ­erÂ­aÂ­tions. Back when exÂ­presÂ­sions of stuÂ­pidity were mostly ephemeral, this didnâ€™t matÂ­ter much, but now that they acÂ­quire inÂ­stant perÂ­maÂ­nence and global reach, they apÂ­pear to swamp evÂ­eryÂ­thing else.</p></li><li><p>Stupid choices used to reÂ­liÂ­ably have unÂ­deÂ­sirÂ­able reÂ­sults; now there is more of a disÂ­conÂ­nect where peoÂ­ple are shielded from the reÂ­sults of their stupid choices, or even reÂ­warded for them (man lights himÂ­self on fire in an easÂ­ily-forseeÂ­able misÂ­adÂ­venÂ­ture, beÂ­comes YouTube legÂ­end). So peoÂ­ple may be apÂ­pearÂ­ing stupid not as a reÂ­sult of beÂ­ing stupid but as the reÂ­sult of a perÂ­verse cost-benefit analÂ­yÂ­sis. PeoÂ­ple are no dumber than they used to be, but for [reaÂ­sons] it has beÂ­come adÂ­vanÂ­taÂ­geous to disÂ­play stuÂ­pidity and so smart peoÂ­ple someÂ­times mimic idiocy so as to reap such adÂ­vanÂ­tages. The smarter they are, the quicker they caught on to this and the betÂ­ter mimics they are, so this makes it look as though the smart peoÂ­ple are beÂ­ing reÂ­placed by moÂ­rons, when reÂ­ally itâ€™s more a matÂ­ter of camÂ­ouÂ­flage.</p></li><li><p>The way we edÂ­uÂ­cate chilÂ­dren went seÂ­riÂ­ously sideÂ­ways a while back, and so, yeah, stupid hapÂ­pened.</p></li><li><p>Newly-popÂ­uÂ­lar meÂ­dia and/â€‹or its conÂ­tent is someÂ­how diÂ­rectly damÂ­agÂ­ing to menÂ­tal facÂ­ulÂ­ties.</p></li><li><p>Changes in meÂ­dia/â€‹comÂ­muÂ­niÂ­caÂ­tions techÂ­nolÂ­ogy alÂ­low stupid peoÂ­ple to be much more promiÂ­nent than they used to be and/â€‹or comÂ­parÂ­aÂ­tively muffle smarter peoÂ­ple.</p></li><li><p>SoÂ­cial meÂ­dia dyÂ­namÂ­ics erode reaÂ­sonÂ­ing and truth-seekÂ­ing while reÂ­wardÂ­ing cogÂ­niÂ­tive biÂ­ases.</p></li><li><p>The news meÂ­dia were doÂ­ing a betÂ­ter job than we reÂ­alÂ­ized in filÂ­terÂ­ing out crap and conÂ­texÂ­tuÂ­alÂ­izÂ­ing new inÂ­forÂ­maÂ­tion inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gently for us, and as the inÂ­terÂ­net deÂ­stroyed the busiÂ­ness model beÂ­hind inÂ­telÂ­liÂ­gent reÂ­portÂ­ing, we failed to come up with a subÂ­stiÂ­tute in time to preÂ­vent idiocy from filling the void and itâ€™s too big a job for inÂ­diÂ­viÂ­dÂ­uÂ­als to do withÂ­out inÂ­stiÂ­tuÂ­tional asÂ­sisÂ­tance.</p></li></ol></div></div>]]>

<h5>2016-10-27 - By Robert Elder</h5>


<p>Updated Oct 27, 2016: Fixed sample code comments in coroutine example as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/59p689/how_to_get_fired_using_switch_statements/d9ad8uc/">per suggestion</a>, edited text to note <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/59p689/how_to_get_fired_using_switch_statements/d9aex9v/">D's similar behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>Updated Oct 28, 2016: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12815726">Added missing colon.</a>, corrected <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12815814">Duff's device example</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter whether you're trying to achieve job security; impressing others by showing them how smart you are; or passive aggressively asserting your dominance over a code base, writing unmaintainable code has a number of practical applications. &nbsp;One extremely unmaintainable and bug-ridden technique for C programming involves using both switch statements and statement expressions together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will discuss how you can leverage switch statements and statement expressions to produce C code that is so difficult to understand, you'll need to look at the assembly to figure out what it does. &nbsp;Many of the examples of syntax in this article are not standards compliant or they won't pass even the simplest of static analysis tests. &nbsp;That should be ok though, because writing many of these examples in your company's code base will probably end up getting you fired anyway.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's start by reviewing the humble switch statement that we all know and love:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>int</span> i = ...;
<span>switch</span>(i){
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:{
		...
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:{
		...
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> <span>2</span>:{
		...
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>default</span>:{
		...
	}
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is what most people are used to thinking about when 'switch statements' are mentioned in C. &nbsp;The rough idea is that switch statements are a sort of more appealing alternative to using lots of 'else if' statements when checking for some disjoint property. &nbsp;Some of you may be surprised to learn that the following is also a valid switch statement:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>int</span> i = ...;
<span>switch</span>(i){
        i++;
        <span>default</span>:{ }
        i++;
        <span>case</span> <span>0</span>:{
                <span>case</span> <span>3</span>: i;
        }
        <span>if</span>(i &lt; <span>10</span>){
                <span>case</span> <span>1</span>:{
                        <span>break</span>;
                }
                <span>for</span>(i=<span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++){
                        <span>case</span> <span>2</span>:;
                }
        }
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's worth pointing out that almost no other languages support switch statements the way that they work in C (although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)">D language</a> is an example). &nbsp;Most other languages have a switch statement that works similar to the idea of a more appealing alternative to many 'else if' checks.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A switch statement in C would be more appropriately called a 'goto field'. &nbsp;This means that the switch(...) part simply makes a decision about which label to branch to. &nbsp;After branching to that label nothing special happens related to the fact that you're inside a switch statement and the code will just keep executing whatever machine instructions come next. &nbsp;The one exception is, of course, the break statement which will jump to the point after the switch statement body. &nbsp;Here is an equivalent version of the switch statement written above using only ifs and gotos.</p>

<p><code><pre><span>int</span> i = ...;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>0</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_0;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>1</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_1;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>2</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_2;
<span>if</span>(i == <span>3</span>)
	<span>goto</span> label_3;

<span>goto</span> label_default;

{
        i++;
        <span>label_default</span>:{ }
        i++;
        <span>label_0</span>:{
                <span>label_3</span>: i;
        }
        <span>if</span>(i &lt; <span>10</span>){
                <span>label_1</span>:{
                        <span>goto</span> break_from_switch;

                <span>for</span>(i=<span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++){
                        <span>label_2</span>:;
                }
        }
}
<span>break_from_switch</span>:
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're already familiar with the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff%27s_device">Duff's device</a> the above this probably isn't news to you:</p>

<p><code><pre>
    <span>int</span> total_bytes = ...;
    <span>int</span> n = (total_bytes + <span>3</span>) / <span>4</span>;
    <span>switch</span> (total_bytes % <span>4</span>) {
            <span>case</span> <span>0</span>: <span>do</span> { *to = *from++;
            <span>case</span> <span>3</span>:      *to = *from++;
            <span>case</span> <span>2</span>:      *to = *from++;
            <span>case</span> <span>1</span>:      *to = *from++;
                    } <span>while</span> (--n &gt; <span>0</span>);
    }
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on Duff's device as inspiration you can use the unique behaviour of switch statements in C to implement coroutines:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>#define coroutine_begin() </span><span>static</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> state=</span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>switch</span><span>(state) { </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>:</span>
<span>#define coroutine_return(x) { state=</span><span>__LINE__</span><span>; </span><span>return</span><span> x; </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>__LINE__</span><span>:; }</span>
<span>#define coroutine_finish() }</span>

<span>int</span> get_next(<span>void</span>) {
        <span>static</span> <span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;
        coroutine_begin();
        <span>while</span> (<span>1</span>){
                coroutine_return(++i);
                coroutine_return(<span>100</span>);
        }
        coroutine_finish();
}

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>1</span>
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>100</span>
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>2</span>
        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, get_next()); <span>100</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example in this section draws on one found in <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html">Coroutines in C by Simon Tatham</a>. &nbsp;The original source describes a few caveats of switch based coroutines that I won't discuss in this article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we resolve the macros, and indent the code a bit better, then remove some superfluous brackets and semicolons, the 'get_next' function becomes:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>1234</span><span>4567</span>

<span>int</span> get_next(<span>void</span>) {
        <span>static</span> <span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;
        <span>static</span> <span>int</span> state = <span>0</span>;
	<span>switch</span>(state) {
		<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:;
		<span>while</span>(<span>1</span>){
			state = <span>1234</span>;
			<span>return</span> ++i;
			<span>case</span> <span>1234</span>:;
			state = <span>4567</span>;
			<span>return</span> <span>100</span>;
			<span>case</span> <span>4567</span>:;
		}
        }
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The static variables are key here, because they allow us to communicate information between calls to the function 'get_next'. &nbsp;The switch statement effectively just gives us a convenient way to implement the goto statements that would be necessary to either jump to the start of the coroutine (state = 0), or the point just after the coroutine returns (state = 1234, and state = 4567). &nbsp;If you want to create more return/resume points you can simply add more calls to the 'coroutine_return' macro. &nbsp;You must also make sure that these calls appear between 'coroutine_begin' and 'coroutine_end'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the syntax of the case statements is throwing you off, just remember that</p>

<p><code><pre><span>case</span> <span>0</span>:;
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does same thing as</p>

<p><code><pre><span>case</span> <span>0</span>: {
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first represents a 'statement' with no expression, and the second represents a 'compound statement' with no declarations or expressions. &nbsp;Neither of these forms has a break statement, so execution will always just continue doing whatever is after the case label in the same way that a goto would work.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we've seen how switch statements can get pretty weird, let's explore a few interesting examples of valid switch statement syntax that (depending on how much of a 1337 hacker you are) you may have never seen before:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>);
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	i++;
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
		<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
			<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
				<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
					<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>);
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:;
</pre></code>

<code><pre><span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>)
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:
		<span>for</span>(i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++)
			<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:
				<span>for</span>(j = <span>0</span>; j &lt; <span>10</span>; j++)
					<span>case</span> <span>2</span>:
						<span>for</span>(k = <span>0</span>; k &lt; <span>10</span>; k++);
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>){
	<span>case</span> <span>0</span>:{
		<span>for</span>(i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++){
			<span>case</span> <span>1</span>:{
				<span>while</span>(j){
					<span>case</span> <span>2</span>:{
						<span>for</span>(k = <span>0</span>; k &lt; <span>10</span>; k++){
						}
					}
					j++;
				}
			}
		}
	}<span>case</span> <span>3</span>:{
		
	}<span>default</span>:{
		
	}
}
</pre></code>

<code><pre>


<span>switch</span>(i)
	<span>default</span>: <span>case</span> <span>0</span>: <span>case</span> <span>1</span>: <span>case</span> <span>2</span>: <span>case</span> <span>3</span>:;
</pre></code>

<code><pre>



<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>){
	<span>case</span> UNIQUE_CASE_A:{
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> UNIQUE_CASE_B:{
		<span>break</span>;
	}<span>case</span> SIMILAR_CASE1: <span>case</span> SIMILAR_CASE2: <span>case</span> SIMILAR_CASE3:{
		<span>break</span>;
	}
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html">Statement expressions</a> are a GNU extension that is not supported by the C standard, but they are supported by default in gcc and clang. &nbsp;They allow you to embed a compound statement within an expression. &nbsp;The value returned by the last expression is the value returned by the entire statement expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;

<span>int</span> j = ({<span>int</span> k; k = i + <span>1</span>; i;}<span>)</span>;
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might ask "Why would you ever want to do such a thing?" &nbsp;There are a number of different answers and many of them are related to convenience: &nbsp;One use case is concerned with ensuring that expression statement side-effects are only evaluated once in the case of a function macro that may cause the expression to appear multiple times in the function macro body.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can stick statement expressions pretty much anywhere you could put a variable:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> get_zero(<span>void</span>){ <span>return</span> <span>0</span>; }

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        <span>0</span><span>9</span>
        <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = ({get_zero();}<span>)</span>; i &lt; <span>10</span>; i++<span>)</span>
                printf(<span>"</span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, i);
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can do pretty much anything inside a statement expression that you could do in a regular compound statement:</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        <span>0</span><span>99</span>
        <span>int</span> i = ({<span>int</span> j = <span>0</span>; <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>100</span>; i++) j+=i; j;}<span>)</span>;
        printf(<span>"Sum is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, i);
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, most of these examples will only compile in clang, since gcc dis-allows branching to a label that is inside a statement expression (which is probably for the best).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's try to embed a switch statement into a switch statement expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>
<span>switch</span>(({<span>switch</span>(<span>0</span>);<span>3</span>;}<span>))</span>;
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup, this compiles in gcc and clang! &nbsp;This code doesn't do anything interesting, but it illustrates one approach to writing C code that is difficult to read.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's try building a more useful example that combines switch and statement expressions. &nbsp;Here is an example where you want to conditionally change the bounds of a loop. &nbsp;You could use a variable or a function but you could also use a statement expression with embedded case labels!</p>

<p><code><pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>void</span> print_stuff(<span>int</span> type){
        <span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>;
        <span>int</span> r = <span>0</span>;
        <span>switch</span>(type){
                <span>for</span>(i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; ({<span>if</span>(<span>0</span>){ <span>case</span> <span>1</span>:r+=<span>2</span>; <span>case</span> <span>0</span>:r+=<span>3</span>;}r;}<span>)</span>; i++<span>)</span>{
                        printf(<span>"i is </span><span>%d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>, i);
                }
        }
}

<span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>){
        printf(<span>"First run</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
        print_stuff(<span>0</span>);
        printf(<span>"Second run</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>);
        print_stuff(<span>1</span>);
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above example gives me the following output:</p>

<p><code><pre>First run
i is 0
i is 1
i is 2
Second run
i is 0
i is 1
i is 2
i is 3
i is 4
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you run this program through valgrind you'll find that this it's doing uninitialized reads:</p>

<p><code><pre>==16228== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
==16228==    at 0x4005AB: print_stuff (main.c:7)
==16228==    by 0x400619: main (main.c:15)
...
==16228== …</pre></code></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Machine learning and data science code is easy to share but hard to use. GitHub overflows with models, algorithms, and datasets. But code is static. Can you play with the models? See the algorithms? Interact with the data? Doing so requires following complex instructions, installing packages, or reading dense code snippets. Frustrated by this, we decided that <strong>we need a simple, sharable "play" button for machine learning code.</strong></p><p>There are two challenges here. The first is <strong>creating</strong> apps that make data science and machine learning code interactive. The second is <strong>sharing</strong> these apps so that the world can experience your work.</p><p>A year ago, we addressed the first challenge — <strong>creating —</strong> by releasing Streamlit, an open-source library that lets you transform Python scripts into interactive apps. Streamlit lets you easily demonstrate algorithms, play with models, manipulate data, and combine all of these superpowers into beautiful apps. The response has been tremendous. We just crossed our millionth download. Hundreds of thousands of Streamlit apps have been created all over the world. <strong>But creating great apps only solves half the problem.</strong></p><p>Today, we address the second challenge — <strong>sharing</strong> — by announcing a brand-new sharing platform for Streamlit. Streamlit sharing lets you deploy, manage, and share your apps – all for free! If you have a Streamlit app hosted publicly on GitHub, you are now one click away from sharing it with the world. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/10/App-dashboard-1.png 1348w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h2 id="github-and-streamlit-better-together">GitHub and Streamlit - Better Together</h2><p>Streamlit sharing <strong>combines the best of Streamlit with the best of GitHub.</strong> From Streamlit you get a simple framework for creating incredibly rich and useful apps.

<h3>HP-28S Battery Compartment Door</h3>
<p>The redesign of the whole HP-28S scientific calculator case is quite difficult and very time consuming. In most cases the only thing broken is the HP-28S battery compartment door, so I decided my first step was to get that re-designed. </p>

<h3>Print testing phase of battery door</h3>
<p>The 3D-print of the HP-28S battery compartment door is being tested right now (05/2020) from a few volunteers. I have reached out to a few 3D designers asking what printing method would be best in making this part. See below for PLA printing picture (not). The answer is Selective Laser Sintering or SLS printing using polyamid (PA). The characteristics are robust and the pegs can be melted down to keep the metal plate or battery contact, in place. <br>Having no experience with 3D printing, I’ve now learned that the following printing methods have certain advantages and disadvantages. </p>
<ul><li>Fused Deposition Modeling or FDM printing</li><li>Stereolithography or SLA printing</li><li>Filament PLA printing (see below)</li></ul>
<p>With FDM printing it is not possible to have the part mechanically resilient. The problem with printing via Stereolithography is with melting the material afterwards. Please find some printing companies <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.teawea.com/3d-print-a-new-hp28s-case/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<h3>Small Assembly of Battery Compartment Door needed</h3>
<p>You should keep your original metal plate from the battery door. After printing the part, you just re-insert the metal plate and melt down the 3 pegs, and voila you have a new battery door.</p>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<ul><li>3D <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.teawea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HPDR-Assembly.pdf" target="_blank">Viewable</a> PDF (Adobe Reader needed)</li><li>After testing the STL file print, I will make it available for download</li></ul>
<h3>PLA printing results</h3>
<p>Feedback from one Tester: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing_filament" target="_blank">PLA</a> filament does not print very well. Adjusted were temperature and speed of print after 3 tries, below pictures show the best it can do. That is the limitation of an entry level 3D printer. <br>Best to use laser type 3D printer, hence SLS printing.</p>

<h3>SLS printing results</h3>
<p>Today June 12th 2020, the first parts arrived and I must say the quality is quite good. I compared the original with the new printed version and I have to make a few adjustments. But now I sourced a printing company close by and progress should be much quicker now.  </p>

<p>Yesterday July 9th 2020, I finally had some time of from work to pick up the 2nd set of printed parts. Very nice quality and the color is just right. The metal plate fits right into the grooves and the 3 pegs are ready to be melted down. Take a look for yourself. I added 2 drops of glue just to be save below the metal plate.</p>

<h3>Ordering and pricing</h3>
<p>I was asked if I had printed a few battery compartment doors and if some could be ordered. So I did some checking on pricing and I ordered 40 of them, which makes sense for that size machine as a minimum order. <br>So if you do NOT want to print them yourself or do not have a SLS printer, you can <a href="https://www.teawea.com/contact-us/">contact me</a> for payment information. <br>Cost €5 a piece + shipping &amp; packaging.  (I would recommend to order 2, so you have a spare)<br>Packaging: €1 (padded envelope)<br>Shipping:  €2 (for 2 parts) within Europe and all other countries<br>As of Oct 2020, I have them available.</p>

  <h5>May 26, 2020</h5>



  

  


  <p>I am a big fan of my Kindle. This is the device I’d bring over to a desert
island. I am also a fairly frequent user of the highlight feature where you can
select a bit of text you like and save it. One thing is bothering me though:
the lack of open API on the Kindle to retrieve the data about me. Amazon
provides the <code>my-clippings.txt</code> file on the Kindle and the “Export my
annotations via e-mail” feature, but both these features cannot be done in the
background automatically, and the last read position is not available. I want
moar !</p>
<p>I want to get the raw data:</p>
<ul>
<li>to print a little book with all my annotations</li>
<li>to retrieve my last read position and see in which periods of my life I tend
to read most (reading less would be a good indicator of stressful periods)</li>
<li>to put the data in my own personal space : my <a href="https://cozy.io/">cozy</a> (I work there).
I could for example randomly display favorite quotes in my Cozy-Home, or
have a “books” app with a public page with all my books. That would be the
digital equivalent of a bookshelf. The bookshelf as a means of sharing good
books that you’ve read is lost with the Kindle. I wish I could easily share
with my friends my reading list. goodreads.com would be another way to do
that, but I’d prefer to have the data at my disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless… but first, I needed to get access to the
data. A long time ago, I tried to access this data via <a href="https://read.kindle.com/">Kindle web</a>
but could not pass the login screen via scraping: there was if I recall
well, credential encryption on the application side, and I had not managed to
redo it correctly.</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen a presentation on using <a href="http://mitm.it/">mitmproxy</a> to discover HTTP
APIs used by apps. It gave me motivation to start again on this project:  this
time, instead of web scraping, I’d try to understand how the Kindle
communicates with Amazon and try to emulate the same HTTP requests to access
my data.</p>
<h2 id="setup-a-man-in-the-middle-on-a-kindle-app">Setup a man in the middle on a Kindle app</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: do not attempt man-in-the-middle attacks on devices or accounts
that are not your own. To successfully conduct this project, you need to have
physical access to the device to install an SSL certificate authority.</p>
<p>To see the flow of communication between an Android device and a remote HTTP
based APIs, things are a bit more involved than from a web browser: in the web
world we have access to the network inspector which helps us record data,
replay calls, see requests and responses, etc… There is no such thing for
Android or iOS. The solution is to do a man-in-the-middle attack on our
device: proxying and recording all traffic through a controlled access point.</p>
<p>The setup is briefly described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Raspberry Pi runs as a wifi access point (through <a href="https://w1.fi/hostapd/">hostapd</a>)</li>
<li>Every packet going through the access point is redirected to mitmproxy (<a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/">in
the transparent mode fashion</a>)</li>
<li>HTTPs man-in-the-middle is made possible thanks to a custom CA authority
installed on the whispersync client device</li>
<li>A real or virtual (for example with <a href="https://genymotion.com/">Genymotion</a>) Android 5
device</li>
<li>Kindle for Android installed on the Android device (the Play store can be
installed on Genymotion)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ It is also possible to use iOS but it is easier to have access to a
virtual Android device since you do not have to own a Mac</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ On Android, it is possible to use user certificates until Android 7
Nougat. After Android 7 Nougat, apps will not use user certificates by
default. More information
<a href="https://blog.jeroenhd.nl/article/android-7-nougat-and-certificate-authorities">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.dinofizzotti.com/blog/2019-01-09-running-a-man-in-the-middle-proxy-on-a-raspberry-pi-3/">a good article to set everything
up</a>.</p>
<p>After all this setup (a bit long and tedious but not hard), it is possible
to record HTTP dumps of the traffic between the Kindle app and Amazon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ssh pi@192.168.50.10
tmux a -t <span>0</span>
<span># launch mitmdump and write request/response to outfile</span>
mitmdump --mode transparent -w outfile
<span># Use the Kindle app to generate traffic</span>
<span># ctrl-c to stop the proxy</span>
exit #
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, <code>outfile</code> contains all the requests and responses in the
mitmproxy format.</p>
<h2 id="recording-http-dumps">Recording HTTP dumps</h2>
<p>mitmproxy uses a custom format to store dumps. It is not very interoperable:
querying and extracting data from the dumps is a bit difficult. HAR is a
standard format used for example in Chrome and Firefox (Network inspector tabs
in both browser can import/export the HAR format). The HAR format underlying
format is JSON which makes it readable and interoperable with tools like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>
that are really handy for filtering / querying.</p>
<p>The mitmproxy repository contains a script to transform a mitmproxy
dumpfile into a HAR file.</p>
<p>To convert a mitmproxy dump into an HAR file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy.git mitmproxy <span># to have access to the HAR conversion script</span>
pip install mitmproxy <span># to have the mitmdump command</span>

<span># Extract the dump from the Raspberry Pi</span>
rsync -aPrs pi@192.168.50.10:outfile dump.mitmproxy

<span># Convert mitmproxy format to HAR format (JSON based format)</span>
mitmdump -vvv -n -r infile.dump  -s mitmproxy/examples/complex/har_dump.py --set hardump<span>=</span>./outfile.har
</code></pre></div><h2 id="understanding-the-flow">Understanding the flow</h2>
<p>With jq, we can extract requests URLs, which is handy to
start understanding the flow of communication between Amazon and our
device.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat dumps/dump.har | jq -rc <span>'.log.entries | map(.request.url)'</span>
<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/registerDevice"</span>,
<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/registerDevice"</span>,
<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/registerDevice"</span>,
<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/registerDevice"</span>,
<span>"https://54.239.22.185/FirsProxy/getStoreCredentials"</span>,
<span>"https://52.46.133.19/FionaTodoListProxy/syncMetaData"</span>,

<span># Unique URLS</span>
cat dumps/dump5.har | jq <span>'.log.entries | map(.request.url) | sort | unique'</span>

<span># Filter all requests with a particular URL</span>
cat dumps/dump5.har | jq <span>'.log.entries | map(select(.request.url == "&lt;MY_URL&gt;"))'</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="registration-and-request-signing">Registration and request signing</h2>
<p>The first call the device makes when logging in is a <code>registerDevice</code> call. It
contains both login and password and is used to register a device on Amazon.
After replaying this request through <code>curl</code>, I had a “Wrong password”
response. It is because Amazon sends a two factor authentication email and you
have to replay (again) the registerDevice call with the value from the two
factor authentication email in the password field to get through.</p>
<p>At this point a new device is visible on Amazon Kindle site 🙌. The next things
to do is to fetch the list of books.</p>
<p>The problem now is that we can see that every subsequent request to Amazon has
a <code>X-ADP-Request-Digest</code>: every request is “signed” with the help of a
certificate received in the <code>registerDevice</code> call.</p>
<p>Below, you can see an example request on the <code>syncMetadata</code> route used to get the
list of books:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"startedDateTime"</span>: <span>"2020-05-10T14:21:42.217752+00:00"</span>,

      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Signing the request means that I needed to use the right key to sign (I was
pretty confident that the privateKey receive in the registerDevice call was the
one to use) sign the right data = find the fields from the request (and in
which order) that were used to make a fingerprint of the request</p>
<p>Fortunately, after a bit of searching I came across the repositories of
lolsborn (<a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/readsync">readsync</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/fiona-client">fiona-client</a>) that had implementation of
request signing for the whispersync API.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>From <a href="https://github.com/lolsborn/readsync/blob/7c0233bc8a6dcc8e8598d014b547bee34ebcadbb/models.py">readsync source code</a>.</p>
<p>From this bit of code, I could see which fields were used and in which order. I
now needed “only” to convert it to Javascript.</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-forge">node-forge</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa">node-rsa</a>, after a fair bit of
struggle, I managed to have the right signature. I found it difficult even
with two example implementations to get the signature exactly right (I am not
an expert in crypto technologies and did not know both libraries, so I spent a
little bit of time trying to jam the certificate and values in every possible
ways 🙃).</p>
<p>Having a bad signature is not immediately obvious since you have to send a
request to Amazon to check it (and if it’s bad, Amazon sends an <code>Internal Server Error</code>). Using a recorded dump to have an example of the right
signature and using it in a <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> test with a fixed date (since the date is
used in the request) was very helpful as the feedback loop was very quick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ I had to use two different libraries to get the same signature. I am
sure it is possible to use only <code>node-forge</code> though.
ℹ️ The private key is a PKCS8 certificate in DER format encoded in base64.
❓I wonder why to sign the requests, the devices do not generate
a private/public key pair and transmit the public key to Amazon: it is
a bit unusual to have something private fly on the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sidecars">Sidecars</h2>
<p>After cracking the signing part, it was possible to call the <code>syncMedata</code>
route, with a proper digest header, to get all the books in our library
(yay!).</p>
<p>But, the challenge was not done yet: I was most interested in getting the
<em>metadata</em> on the book: my highlights, annotations and last page read. I

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>State charts provide a graphical way of modeling how a system reacts to stimuli. This is done by defining the possible <i>states</i> that the system can be in, and how the system can move from one state to another (<i>transitions</i> between states). A key characteristic of event-driven systems (such as Qt applications) is that behavior often depends not only on the last or current <i>event</i>, but also the events that preceded it. With state charts, this information is easy to express.</p>
<p>Qt Creator provides a project wizard for adding <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/">State Chart XML (SCXML)</a> files with boilerplate code to projects and an experimental SCXML editor for editing the state charts. You can use the SCXML editor to add <i>states</i> and <i>transitions</i> to the files. You can then use the classes in the Qt SCXML module to embed the state machines created from the files in Qt applications.</p>
<p><img alt="SXCML Editor" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/qtcreator-scxml-editor.png"></p><p>You can drag and drop states from the <b>Common States</b> view (1) to the state editor (2). Select a state in the state editor and use the tool buttons (3) to create a transition (4) and its <i>target state</i>.</p>
<p>You can view the state chart structure in the <b>Structure</b> view (5) and specify attributes for the selected state or transition in the <b>Attributes</b> view (6).</p>
<p>You can use the toolbar buttons (7) to execute functions such as editing, zooming, magnifying, navigating, and panning state charts, as well as taking screenshots and viewing statistics.</p>
<p>To zoom into and out of the whole state chart in the state editor, select <b>Zoom In</b> or <b>Zoom Out</b> or press <b>Ctrl</b> and use the mouse wheel. To make the whole state chart visible in the state editor at a time, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/fittoview.png"> (<b>Fit to View</b>).</p>
<p>To view a particular part of a large state chart in the state editor, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/navigator.png"> (<b>Navigator</b>) and move the navigator frame on the part you want to view.</p>
<p>To use the magnifier to zoom into a part of the state chart, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/zoom.png"> (<b>Magnifier Tool</b>). To move the magnifier tool faster, press down the <b>Alt</b> key.</p>
<p>To pan the state chart, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/pan.png"> (<b>Panning</b>). To increase the pace of panning, press down the <b>Shift</b> key.</p>
<p>To view statistics about the numbers of states and transitions in the state chart, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/statistics.png"> (<b>View Statistics</b>).</p>
<p>To search from the state chart, use the <b>Search</b> pane. The search checks the whole SCXML tree for attributes that match the search criteria.</p>
<p>To save the currently visible part of the state chart as an image, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/snapshot.png"> (<b>Save Screenshot</b>). To save the whole state chart as an image, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/icon-export-canvas.png"> (<b>Export Canvas to Image</b>).</p>
<h2 id="creating-state-charts">Creating State Charts<a href="#creating-state-charts" title="Direct link to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>To create a state chart:</p>
<ol type="1"><li>Select <b>Help</b> &gt; <b>About Plugins</b> &gt; <b>Modeling</b> &gt; <b>ScxmlEditor</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>Restart Now</b> to restart Qt Creator and load the plugin.</li>
<li>Select <b>File</b> &gt; <b>New File or Project</b> &gt; <b>Files and Classes</b> &gt; <b>Modeling</b> &gt; <b>State Chart</b> &gt; <b>Choose</b> to create an empty state chart and to open it in the SCXML editor.</li>
<li>Drag and drop a state from the <b>Common States</b> view to the state editor.</li>
<li>Drag and drop child states to the initial state to create a <i>compound state</i> or use the tool buttons to create a transition from the selected state and its target state.</li>
<li>Select a state to edit its attributes in the <b>Attributes</b> view.</li>
<li>Select the transition line to add edge points to it.</li>
<li>To raise or send events, for example, use the context menu commands to add executable content to the <code>&lt;onentry&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;onexit&gt;</code> elements of states or to transitions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following sections describe how to manage states, transitions, and executable content.</p>
<h2 id="managing-states">Managing States<a href="#managing-states" title="Direct link to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>When the state machine enters a state in response to an event, the state that it entered becomes the <i>active state</i>.</p>
<p>State charts are hierarchical, and therefore states can be nested inside other states, to create compound states.</p>
<p>In addition to basic states, you can create the following types of states:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Initial</i> state is the state the state machine enters when it starts.</li>
<li><i>Parallel state</i> contains child states that execute in parallel and are all active simultaneously. Events are processed independently by each child state and may trigger different transitions for each child.</li>
<li><i>Final state</i> enables a state machine to finish. When the state machine enters a top-level final state, it emits the finished signal and halts. You can create final states in compound states to hide the internal details of a compound state. The outside world can only enter the state and get a notification when the state has finished. A parallel state finishes when all its child states reach final states.</li>
<li><i>History state</i> is a pseudo-state that represents the child state the parent state was in the last time the parent state was exited.<p>Create a history state as a child of the state for which you want to record the current child state. When the state machine detects the presence of such a state at runtime, it automatically records the current (real) child state when the parent state is exited. A transition to the history state is in fact a transition to the child state that the state machine previously saved. The state machine automatically forwards the transition to the real child state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add new states to the state chart in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop states from the <b>Common States</b> view to the state editor.</li>
<li>Select a state in the state editor, and then select the <b>State</b> tool button to create a transition and its target state.</li>
<li>Copy and paste states within the SCXML editor or between the SCXML editor and the <b>Edit</b> mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can drag states on top of other states to create compound states, or you can drag child states out of their parent state. To move child states within their parent, press down the <b>Ctrl</b> key while moving them.</p>
<p>You can use toolbar buttons to align states in the state editor, to adjust their size, and to change the default color scheme. Overlapping states are marked in red color.</p>
<p>To expand or collapse the state tree structure in the <b>Structure</b> view, double-click a state.</p>
<p>To view a child state of a nested state in more detail in the state editor, select <b>Zoom to State</b>.</p>
<p>To ensure that the state ids are unique within a compound state machine, select <img alt="" src="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/images/namespace.png"> (<b>Toggle Full Namespace</b>). The name of the parent state is added to the names of the child states, separated by two colons (<a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qromancalendar.html">::</a>). For example:</p>
<div><pre><span title="Toggle line wrap"></span>&lt;state id="broken"&gt;
...
    &lt;state id="broken::blinking"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/state&gt;
    &lt;state id="broken::unblinking"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/state&gt;
&lt;/state&gt;</pre></div>
<h2 id="managing-transitions">Managing Transitions<a href="#managing-transitions" title="Direct link to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Transitions define how a state reacts to <i>events</i> that are generated either by the state machine or external entities. When events occur, the state machine checks for a matching transition defined in the active state and moves to its target state.</p>
<p>To create a transition from the selected state to a new state, drag and release the mouse at the location where you want to add the target state. When you draw a transition to the center of another state, it points to the center of the state, but you can also draw a transition to the edge of the state.</p>
<p>To add edge points to transitions, select a transition line. Only two edge points are permitted for each line, and unnecessary edge points are removed automatically. To remove the selected edge point, select <b>Remove Point</b> in the context menu.</p>
<p>To add new edge points with a mouse click, select the <b>Transition</b> tool button.</p>
<p>A transition label is automatically center-aligned, but you can drag it to another position.</p>
<p>To remove the selected transition, select <b>Remove</b> in the context menu.</p>
<h2 id="adding-executable-content">Adding Executable Content<a href="#adding-executable-content" title="Direct link to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>You can add <i>executable content</i> to a state chart to enable the state machine to modify its data model and to interact with external entities.</p>
<p>Use the context menu commands to add executable content to the <code>&lt;onentry&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;onexit&gt;</code> elements or to transitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;raise&gt;</code> to raise events</li>
<li><code>&lt;send&gt;</code> to communicate with external entities</li>
<li><code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to run scripts</li>
<li><code>&lt;assign&gt;</code> to modify the data model</li>
<li><code>&lt;cancel&gt;</code> to cancel action execution</li>
<li><code>&lt;log&gt;</code> to record information in a log</li>
<li><code>&lt;if&gt;</code> to execute actions conditionally</li>
<li><code>&lt;foreach&gt;</code> to iterate over the items in a collection and execute an action for each of them</li>
</ul>
<p>During a transition, the state machine executes the content that you specify for the <code>&lt;onexit&gt;</code> element in the state it is leaving, then the content in the transition, and then the content for the <code>&lt;onentry&gt;</code> element in the state it is entering.</p>
<p>You can add attributes for the selected executable content in the <b>Attributes</b> view.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>14 Oct 2020</span></p><p>tl;dr: the three things I expect from an engineering manager are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support the members of your team and help them grow.</li>
<li>Follow along the deliveries, setting quality standards, making sure the team has the support they need and upper management the feedback they need. </li>
<li>Keep a constant practice of creating, improving or eliminating team or company processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every organization has its own way of working and your mileage may vary. I've collected a few points that I believe that are overall expectations.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove" title="Andy Grove page on wikipedia">Andy Grove</a> on his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management">High Output Management</a> defined a manager output as the sum of their team output and the teams under their influence output. He also recommends selecting activities producing high leverage: an activity he did as a CEO was an introductory talk to new employees, in which he explained the history, the values and the objectives for Intel. If he does this very well, this can generate great impact on every new employee.</p>

<p>A good example of a high leverage is partnering with other leads: being able to understand where the business is going and helping building a technical roadmap to facilitate getting there. Another high leverage is to guide each member of your team to acquire new skills so they can increase their scope and increase their impact on the organization.</p>



<p>Your team's output is really dependent on your team members, so an expectation for engineering managers is to <strong>support the members of your team and help them grow</strong>.</p>

<p>A good way to think about hiring and growing your team members is to think that they can replace you. You can't actually do that unless you know everyone really well. What are their strenghts and weaknesses? What are their goals and what motivates them? Which level they're operating? What might need them to go to the next one?</p>

<p>1:1s play a big role here: it is your time to learn more about each person. It is a great time to establishes trust and build rapport. 
Another crucial factor on people is to set expectations: setting a clear expectation on what you expect from each person creates a more concrete notion on what they should and shouldn't do and what level they should perform: recognizing when someone performed really well and giving constructive feedback when they haven't reached your expectations. Feedback is a hard subject, but if you can back your feedbacks with examples, it will be much more clear on what you're recognizing or you're giving a constructive feedback: a good practice is to give continuous (a practice suggested by <a href="https://www.camilletalk.com/">Camille Fournier</a> on her book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path">The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change</a>feedback: on every 1:1 try to bring an example-backed feedback.</p>

<p>If you find yourself giving constructive feedback but you're not seeing improvements, make it clear as early as possible. Dealing with underperformance isn't an easy task, and sometimes we hope that with guidance they will improve, but making it clear that it isn't working is part of your job and perhaps it is time to set more prescriptive actions and a timeline for improvement: a tool that can help is Personal Improvement Plan in which you set a clear expectations, actions that you think will help them you and an expected timeline.</p>

<p>A hard part of this job is that if someone isn't performing even after this, you have to let them go. There is also behavior: if someone had an unacceptable behavior, it is part of your job to take action. Dealing with underperformance/letting people go is a tough subject (which I don't have much experience): I highly recommend asking your HR Business Partner and your manager to help with that.</p>

<p>Your company will also count on you on performance reviews, which happens a few times a year and you can discuss with each person their actual performance along with career progression: if they're doing really well, you can promote/make a case for their promotion to your peers and senior management. You can also use this time to set goals on what people need to improve and learn for the next cycle. Some companies use this period to set performance improvement plans for people below expectations. Performance reviews usually generate anxiety for everyone: if you're working on giving continuous feedback every 1:1, it should be an easier conversation without  surprises.</p>

<p>As a final recommendation on people expectations, I'd highly recommend learning more about delegation (without micromanaging): allowing people to have autonomy on how they should do a task will allow them to grow and also you can focus on exerting higher leverage. You can't control every action and if there is a mistake, you have to guide people on learning from it: Ray Dahlio on his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles">Principles: Life and Work</a> enforces that you should have a culture in which is ok to make mistakes and unacceptable to not learn from them. Google also researched a lot about psychological safety and <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/">they found out that </a> in their best teams people feel safe taking risks.</p>



<p>Another expectation on an engineering management job is delivery: your company expects that you <strong>follow along the deliveries, setting quality standards, making sure the team has the support they need and upper management the feedback they need.</strong></p>

<p>This is where delegation plays its role: to exert leverage, you have to delegate the execution of a project to the team: delegating something doesn't mean you can forget about that delivery, you need to make sure it is done (or explain why it isn't) and support that delivery.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Grove">Andy Grove</a> tells about 4 types of activities that a manager does: Acquire Information, Communicate Information, Decision Making and Nudging. When support delivering value, we perform these activities: we acquire information about what we're delivering, we communicate back and forth, we nudge the team on decisions and when the decision has bigger trade-offs or when the team can't make a decision, we need to make the decision based on the acquired information and communicate our reasoning to everyone else. If a decision is controversial, make it clear and explicit the controversial points and the trade-offs that were considered.</p>

<p>A recurrent is waffling a decision: when the team needs to make a decision and the discussions about it can't converge: if a decision is a roadblock, it is your duty to understand the tradeoffs, discuss with all relevant parties and make a decision. If it seems complicated, it is because it is.</p>

<p>Communication is probably your most important tool on delivering: acquiring information, partner on generating a purpose along with your peers and communicate the problem being solved to the team and communicate the progress to everyone interested.</p>

<p>When a decision doesn't seem big and only affects the team, I recommend delegating it to the team and discuss the trade-offs: if prefer one of the options but the other ones doesn't have significant downsides, nudging is a good idea: telling what path you think it is best and why, but remember: your word carries a lot of weight and people usually expect that a manager makes all decisions.</p>

<p>Another important job is on setting a vision, a mission and objectives: a vision is a long-term objective something that with you expect to reach in 5 year, a mission is a short-term (6 months) and objectives are the guard-rails that will ensure you're on path to the vision: OKRs is a very famous methodology to help with that.</p>



<p>When teams and companies become bigger it is inevitable that rules, policies and do's and don'ts start being created. As a leader for your team, it is expected that you <strong>keep a constant practice of creating, improving or eliminating team or company processes.</strong></p>

<p>Since the agile manifesto with the tenet People and interactions over processes and tools, processes got a bad reputation: specially the ones more bureaucratic. But the process itself isn't the problem, the problem is putting it above people and interactions.</p>

<p>I tend to say that the best process is a self regulating one, but I'm aware that it won't be enough. Self-regulating a team backlog with a 2-3 person team might work, but for a 5-6 person team a regular weekly meeting to discuss and an organized kanban board can be valuable tools.</p>

<p>I tend to start with low or none processes on a new team and when a problem arises, I try to nudge into a process and make a working agreement that we're going to experiment. With experience, it is likely we will find patterns and solutions we've seen elsewhere, but as every team and every context is different, rarely a process took from other team will fit perfectly into a new one.</p>

<p>And if it does not work, you probably need to re-discuss: it is not hard to become the rules cop and start complaining that the people does not follow a process. Instead, do a retrospective and learn what works and what not.</p>

<p>There might be a case in which a process comes from other team and your team is not happy. Your duty is to collect the pain points and bring the concerns to the other team. You actually don't need to solve everything (and you can't) but passing along the feedback and listening to the other team concerns as well helps.</p>



<p>I wrote this article as a first reading on someone interested in becoming a manager: I hope that helps you to understand. There are a lot of books and studies about these topics and you will find that improving your skills on them will significantly improve the quality of the work as a manager.</p>

<p>A common path that some companies take is to pick the most senior person on a team and promote them to manager but it takes a lot more than just technical knowledge to be a good manager: being able to communicate well and partner with other functions are other skills that help a lot.</p>



<p>I highly recommend <a href="https://www.camilletalk.com/">Camille Fournier</a> book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path">The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change</a>: it gives a comprehensible overview of each step on the management ladder.</p>

<p>A fantastic book about people management and specially …</p></div></div></div>

<center>Vladimir Keleshev • 2020-10-13</center>


<p>LDM—or <em>load multiple</em>—is my favorite assembly instruction of the ARM instruction set. Here’s why.</p>
<p>First, let’s discuss what LDM does. An example:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0, r1, r2, r3}</code></pre>
<p>Here, it takes a <em>base register</em> (in this case, <code>r4</code>) and a <em>register set</em> (in this case, <code>{r0, r1, r2, r3}</code>). It loads consecutive words from the address in the base register into the registers in the set. In this example, the effect could be described using the following C-like pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>r0 = r4[0];
r1 = r4[1];
r2 = r4[2];
r3 = r4[3];</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few assignments for a single instruction! And that’s why it’s called <em>load multiple</em>.</p>
<p>The set notation also allows for ranges. We can rewrite the previous example as follows:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r4, {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>Any and all of the 16 ARM registers are allowed in the set. So, the following is legal:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15}</code></pre>
<p>The register set is encoded as a 16-bit mask in a 32-bit instruction. Here’s a simplified encoding of the original example:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://keleshev.com/ldm-my-favorite-arm-instruction/ldm-encoding-arm.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Simplified encoding of the LDM instruction</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such instruction is a perfect fit for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load%E2%80%93store_architecture">load-store architecture</a> like ARM, where the primary workflow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>load many values from memory into registers,</li>
<li>perform operations exclusively on registers,</li>
<li>store results back from registers into memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The opposite of LDM is STM—<em>store multiple</em>.</p>
<!---Since both of them operate on *sets* of registers (which are implemented as bit masks), you can't directly select the order in which the values are loaded or stored.
The set `{r0, r1, r2}` is the same as `{r2, r1, r0}`.
That's why-->
<h2 id="block-copy">Block copy</h2>
<p>With these two, you can copy large blocks of memory fast. You can copy eight words (or 32 bytes!) of memory in just two instructions:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0, {r4-r11}
stm r1, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<p>LDM and STM also have auto-increment variants (denoted with “!”) where the base register is incremented by the number of words loaded/stored so that you can do the copying in a fast loop:</p>
<pre><code>ldm r0!, {r4-r11}
stm r1!, {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="implementing-stacks">Implementing stacks</h2>
<p>ARM’s POP instruction is simply an alias for LDM with a stack pointer (and auto-increment). The following two are exactly the same:</p>
<pre><code>ldm sp!, {r0-r3}
pop {r0-r3}</code></pre>
<p>And the PUSH instruction is an alias for an STM variant (STMDB).</p>
<p>You can push and pop large quantities to and from the stack in one go. And if you replace SP by another register you can implement efficient stacks in other regions of memory. For example, you can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_stack">shadow stack</a> in the heap.</p>
<h2 id="saving-registers">Saving registers</h2>
<p>Are you hesitating to use the call-preserved registers because you need to save them, and you might as well use a stack slot anyway? Not any more, because you can save all call-preserved registers you want to use in one go:</p>
<pre><code>push {r4-r11}</code></pre>
<h2 id="prologue-and-epilogue">Prologue and epilogue</h2>
<p>On ARM, the first four arguments, the return address (LR) and the frame pointer (FP) are all passed in registers. That’s why it’s especially important to have efficient prologues and epilogues. Fortunately, you can save FP and LR in one go, using a fairly standard ARM prologue:</p>
<pre><code>push {fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>And then restore both and return (for the epilogue):</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, lr}
bx lr</code></pre>
<p>Even better, you can restore both and return in one go!</p>
<pre><code>pop {fp, pc}</code></pre>
<p>This works by popping the return address value (LR) into the program counter register (PC), so you don’t need an explicit return!</p>
<p>This is good enough in itself, but you can—<em>at the same time</em>—spill some arguments onto the stack (for example, if their address is taken):</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can save FP and LR and—<em>at the same time</em>—allocate some space on the stack:</p>
<pre><code>push {r0-r3, fp, lr}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we push <code>r0-r3</code> not for their value but to advance the stack pointer by four words.</p>
<h2 id="arm64">ARM64</h2>
<p>I suspect it was a difficult trade-off, but when it was time to design the 64-bit version of the ARM instruction set, the decision was made to double the number of registers to 32. I remember reading a paper saying that this change improves the performance by about 6% across the board. With 32 registers it is no longer possible to encode a bitmask of all registers into a 32-bit long instruction. So, instead, ARM64 has LDP and STP: load pair and store pair, which are the spiritual successors of LDM and STM.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
I’ve been reading about Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom.
</p>
<p>
Yuan migrated to the USA from China in the 80s. He had heard Bill Gates speak about the internet and he wanted to be a part of the digital revolution. 
</p>
<p>
So he applied for his visa. He was rejected. He applied again. Rejected again.
</p>
<p>
9 tries. It took Eric Yuan 9 tries to finally get his visa for the USA.
</p>
<p>
Once in the USA, he started working at the video conferencing software company WebEx. 
</p>
<p>
He worked there for a decade and rose up the ranks to become the VP of Engineering. 
</p>
<p>
Under Yuan’s leadership, WebEx grew to more than 750 engineers and had an annual revenue of around $1B (and was later acquired by Cisco). Safe to say the company was doing well. 
</p>
<p>
But there was a problem. 
</p>
<p>
The video conferencing software <em>sucked</em>. 
</p>
<p>
Yuan would meet with customers and they would be unhappy. They’d complain about video and audio lag. Connectivity issues. All sorts of stuff. 
</p>
<p>
In Yuan’s own words:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Before I left Cisco I spent a lot of time talking to WebEx customers and every time I talked to them I felt very embarrassed because I did not see a single happy customer, and I tried to understand why that was.
    <span>Eric Yuan</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
So in 2011, Yuan left. He decided to start his own company with the mission of building the best video conferencing software in the world. 
</p>
<p>
After he left, 40 of the 800 engineers he worked with immediately joined him at Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/dscheinm/status/1300544031458553859">this tweet</a>, almost all of the others sent in resumes to work with him. He had something like 1000 job inquiries within a week of announcing his leaving.
</p>
<p>
Talk about engineering loyalty. 
</p>
<p>
Today Zoom is valued at more than $40 billion. The pandemic may have accelerated the company’s growth but make no mistake: this was an overnight success 9 years in the making. 
</p>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>
I think the part that stands out the most to me is that Yuan actually had the courage to leave Cisco and go on to start Zoom. 
</p>
<p>
There is often great inertia that prevents us from leaving jobs we’re unhappy with. 
</p>
<p>
In Yuan’s case, he had by all measures a very successful career ever since he immigrated to the US. Most people in his shoes wouldn’t even bother resigning from a comfortable VP of Engineering position. 
</p>
<p>
So he could have settled and just resigned himself to the fact that maybe video conferencing software was supposed to be like this. After all, there was very little competition in the market. 
</p>
<p>
But he didn’t. He chose discomfort and hundreds of other engineers believed in him. 
</p>
<p>
Keep moving forward and don’t settle. You might be surprised at how many people follow you. 
</p>
