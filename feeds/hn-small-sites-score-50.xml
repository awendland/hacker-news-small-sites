<h2>What’s wrong with Disqus</h2>
<p>Disqus loads absurd amount of tracking services, which exposes your visitors’
personal data and significantly increases loading time. See, e.g., 
<a href="http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#what-s-wrong-with-disqus">this post</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s not covered here</h2>
<p>For a static website, one usually wants a lightweight commenting server with
as little dependencies as possible. Few commenting engines listed on the page
are provided by heavy applications (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">discourse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/debiki/talkyard">talkyard</a>), but the majority are
relatively lightweight applications designed specifically to provide 
comments for the static pages.</p>
<p>This page prioritizes information on self-hosted comments. However, there
are other open-source solutions, including implementations of third-party
services (e.g., Github issues, such as
<a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk">[2]</a>,

<a href="https://github.com/utterance/utterances">[4]</a>).</p>
<h2>Stars vs. time</h2>
<p>The figure below shows some of the top competitors except for Discourse (as it's not
just a light commenting server like others). The figure is useful to
indirectly estimate how active the project is.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 1984 the co-inventor of Unix, Ken Thompson, delivered a seminal speech in which he highlighted that <em>you can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself</em> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. For a while, this lesson was largely ignored as open-source package registries like RubyGems, PyPI and npm grew rapidly. However, as we’re seeing <a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/mining-for-malicious-ruby-gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> supply-chain attacks through software dependencies, the risks of using unvetted dependencies are becoming clearer.</p>

<p>The risks are particularly great for JavaScript applications. Veracode found that the average JavaScript project relies on 377 dependencies – compared with just 16 for Python projects, or 43 in the Java ecosystem<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Whenever a developer pulls in a new dependency, they are implicitly trusting the maintainers of that dependency. Often, this trust is awarded on the basis of popularity – we assume that a popular library will be more carefully vetted, or that since many others trust the maintainers, we can too. Other times, this trust relationship and the risks involved are not considered at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some have argued</a> that the ill health of the npm registry is a social, rather than a technical problem, and suggest a human-compiled set of packages in order to separate the wheat of maintained, healthy packages from the chaff of abandoned toy projects with no documentation. <a href="https://medium.com/@dpc_96143/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse-b75d58398cb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another suggestion from the Rust world</a> involves creating a manual web of trust from maintainers cryptographically signing each other’s projects. Either way, there are challenges: webs of trust have rarely taken off (outside of Debian), and compiling a vetted set of packages from scratch is a massive undertaking. I propose something in the middle: bootstrapping a web of trust using existing npm dependency relationships, and building from that foundation.</p>

<h2 id="existing-trust-relationships-in-npm">Existing trust relationships in npm</h2>

<p>Creating a web of trust from existing npm dependencies is, admittedly, somewhat problematic. As stated earlier, choosing to use a particular dependency is not always a well-considered decision based on researching its code and maintainers, and the trust relationship is merely implied. Similarly, there is no cryptographic verification of this weak trust, nor does npm currently have the infrastructure for such tools<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. What I am suggesting is an imperfect starting point to demonstrate the need for, and potential of, stronger trust measures in open source.</p>

<p>To construct this initial web, we can model npm’s maintainerships as a graph. If we let each node be a maintainer, then the edges between them are the trust relationship arising from using a dependency. In other words, if Alice maintains a package A, and A depends on package B maintained by Bob, then there is a directed edge from Alice to Bob. We can even weigh these edges by the number of Alice’s packages in which she implies trust of Bob.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-graph">Exploring the graph</h2>

<p>This simple model exhibits a power-law-like pattern in terms of trust: the vast majority of users are trusted by few or no others, and a very small number of users are highly trusted. This type of pattern is common in social networks: you see a similar thing emerge when plotting follower counts on Twitter. Such power laws often lead to a rich-get-richer feedback process in which the inequality (in terms of trust, in this case) gets more pronounced over time<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/efe1a929e64ebeeb021e79f341b35faa4baf1397/c0643/static/img/maintainer-wot-in-degrees.png" alt="Scatter plot of in-degree vs. number of users. Shows a roughly power-law relationship."></p>

<p>Who are these highly-trusted users? They’re who you’d expect: bots for large projects (e.g. <code>types</code>), corporate accounts (e.g. <code>fb</code>), and the maintainers of extremely popular open-source libraries (e.g. <code>sindresorhus</code>, who maintains e.g. <code>string-length</code>).</p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, this web of trust exhibits some useful structures. A number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly connected components</a> emerge – groups of users that, roughly speaking, all trust each other according to the web of trust principles (i.e. if I trust Alice, and Alice trusts Bob, then I trust Bob, too). All of these connected components are small, with the exception of a single one that’s home to over 11,000 users<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. This core component – we’ll call it the <strong>strong set</strong> – could provide a starting point for a measure of trust in the npm ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can quantify trust in a slightly more nuanced way than simply looking at the in-degree of each npm user. The PageRank algorithm provides such a measure that takes into account the trustworthiness of the people who trust me. For example, I may only be trusted by one user, but if that user is <code>isaacs</code> (the creator of npm) then that trust relationship counts for a lot! After running PageRank, the 10 “most-trusted” users are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>types</code></li>
  <li><code>sindresorhus</code></li>
  <li><code>angular</code></li>
  <li><code>m1tk4</code></li>
  <li><code>tjholowaychuk</code></li>
  <li><code>google-wombot</code></li>
  <li><code>fb</code></li>
  <li><code>isaacs</code></li>
  <li><code>gaearon</code></li>
  <li><code>yyx990803</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these are unsurprising. However, <code>m1tk4</code> stands out: they only maintain two rarely-downloaded libraries. Because one of these libraries is used by the BBC, <code>m1tk4</code> is implicitly trusted by a large number of relatively trustworthy BBC employees who maintain other, more popular projects. This demonstrates how PageRank diffuses trust across the social network of npm maintainers. In fact, <code>m1tk4</code> is not a member of the strong set mentioned earlier – but many of the users who trust them <em>are</em>. <code>m1tk4</code> just doesn’t trust those users back!</p>

<p>While PageRank gives a fun measure of trust, it’s a very rough model for the reasons mentioned earlier: it’s based on a pretty weak indication of real trust. However, it might be useful in detecting suspicious behaviours in npm, which is something we – or registry maintainers – need to do proactively if we want to stop supply-chain attacks. For example, it might be a red flag if a highly-trusted user suddenly starts using a library by someone with a PageRank-based-trust of close to 0. And regardless, the strong set comes merely from observing which dependencies people choose to use without applying any complex calculations.</p>

<p>How might we want to use the strong set to create a stricter trust (or reputation) system? I think that formalizing such a system is unlikely if it requires large-scale buy-in from npm users. Instead, we might create a simple wrapper for npm that checks if you’re about to install something from a developer outside of the strong set, similar to Liran Tal’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/lirantal/npq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npq</a>. Or perhaps security researchers could use the npm web of trust as an additional data point when deciding whether a suspicious package warrants further investigation. Either way, the state of trust within the npm ecosystem is not great. This model gives us a starting point.</p>

<p><em>Do you think I’ve got it all wrong? Or do you have further suggestions on how we can improve the state of trust in open source? <a href="https://www.btao.org/contact">Get in touch</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>A final note: this analysis is based on data from June 2020, which I collected for my Master’s thesis. I believe you’d reach similar numbers if you ran the analysis on data from today.</em></p>

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>On Monday, a group of researchers sponsored by Breakthrough Listen, the world’s largest SETI program, </span><a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu/lunarseti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted a paper</a><span> to National Academy of Sciences’ Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey that makes the case for establishing a SETI radio observatory on the farside of the moon. The decadal survey establishes scientific priorities for the next ten years and the new paper addresses one of the biggest problems facing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence today: The overwhelming amount of radio interference.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Our planet has become so “loud” in the part of the radio spectrum observed by SETI that it threatens to drown out any signal sent from an intelligent civilization. Not only would a lunar radio telescope not have to deal with terrestrial radio interference, it could also significantly increase our chances of hearing from ET by opening up parts of the radio spectrum that are blocked by Earth's atmosphere. While the idea of using the moon for radio astronomy is decades old, the researchers make the case that technological advancements have finally made a lunar SETI observatory truly feasible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>
says Eric Michaud, an intern at the SETI Berkeley Research Center and the first author of the paper. “Maybe not today, but I think it’s going to get more and more feasible as time goes on.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Radio interference has been a problem for SETI from the very beginning. In the spring of 1960, the planetary scientist Frank Drake trained the massive radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia on Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, two stars a mere 12 light years from Earth. That summer, Drake spent his days studying the signals picked up by Green Bank’s giant mechanical ear in the hopes of receiving a message broadcast by an alien civilization orbiting those stars. Known as Project Ozma, Drake’s experiment marked the beginning of SETI, the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Shortly after Drake started his observations, he was surprised to find what appeared to be a signal of intelligent origin. After days of watching a needle drift lazily over a spool of paper recording the random undulations of cosmic static, Drake and his colleagues were jolted awake when the machine started recording the frantic pulses of a strong radio signal picked up by the telescope. The timing and magnitude of the pulses clearly marked them as artificial; there was nothing in the natural world that could produce such a frenetic radio profile. It would have been an astounding stroke of luck to pick up an alien message after only a few hours of observation, but it was hard to argue with the data.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“None of us had ever seen anything like it,” Drake recalled in </span><em>Is Anyone Out There?</em><span>, his autobiographical book about the early days of SETI. “We looked at each other wide-eyed. Could discovery be this easy?”</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>

It was a letdown, but the false detection turned out to be a portent for the future of SETI. In the 60 years since Drake’s pioneering experiment, researchers have conducted dozens of SETI searches across thousands of stars and turned up empty-handed. At the same time, the sources of radio interference on Earth—military radars, TV towers, cell phones, and satellites—have exponentially increased, which greatly increases the chances that an extraterrestrial signal will be lost among the noise.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Earth was never a particularly great place to do any kind of radio astronomy due to our thick atmosphere blocking a large portion of the radio spectrum. The proliferation of radio communication technologies has only made things harder. The moon, by comparison, has no atmosphere and its nights last for weeks on end, which limits radio noise from the sun. And as&nbsp;NASA discovered through a spate of lunar orbiter missions in the late 1960s, the moon also acts as a natural shield that blocks radio signals emanating from Earth. As the planetary astronomer Phillipe Zarka has put it, “the farside of the moon during the lunar night is the most radio-quiet place in our local universe.” It’s exactly the sort of peace and quiet you want if you’re searching for faint radio signals from solar systems that might be hundreds of light years away.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>The new Breakthrough Listen paper proposed two main approaches to a lunar SETI observatory: an orbiter and a telescope on the surface. The basic idea behind a SETI lunar orbiter would be to scan for signals as it passed over the lunar farside and relay data back to Earth as it passed over the near side. One of the main advantages of an orbiter is cost. The proliferation of small satellites that are capable of accurate tracking combined with low-cost small launch providers like Rocket Lab means that a SETI orbiter could conceivably be sent to the moon </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-cubesat-to-moon-from-virginia/#:~:text=The%20firm%2Dfixed%2Dprice%20launch,Tyvak%20Nano%2DSatellite%20Systems%20Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for less than $20 million</a><span>. This would be a valuable pathfinder mission that could pave the way for a more ambitious observatory on the surface, but without the risk and cost.&nbsp; As the </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/the-supercluster-podcast-water-bears-might-now-occupy-the-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ill-fated Israeli Beresheet lander mission</a><span> reminded us, landing on the moon is extremely challenging even when the mission is backed by $100 million.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But a SETI lunar orbiter would also come with a lot of compromises. It would only be able to conduct observations during the brief stretches when it was on the lunar farside, which would make a sustained observation campaign more challenging. The upshot is that an orbiter would have access to the full sky, whereas a telescope on the surface would be constrained by the moon’s rotation. The biggest downside of an orbiter is that it might lose a lot of the shielding benefits of the moon and be more vulnerable to radio interference from Earth since it would be orbiting high above the lunar surface.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“The first SETI observations that are done from the lunar farside will be done from orbit, there’s no question about that,” says Andrew Siemion, the director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and the second author on the paper. “I think eventually we absolutely want to do something on the surface because we want to build a very large aperture telescope, but even when we’re at that point I don’t think that would negate the utility of doing things from orbit as well.”&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>So what would a SETI observatory on the moon look like? One idea is to use the naturally parabolic lunar crater as a radio dish, much like the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/chinas-massive-telescope-is-the-next-great-seti-hope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAST telescope in China</a><span>, which are built into natural depressions in the land. This idea was </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/RS012i005p00845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first considered</a><span> back in the late 1970s by a group of scientists at the radio physics lab at the Stanford Research Institute. Their idea was to recreate Arecibo on the moon by suspending an antenna from the lip of a crater and using the basin as a reflector. The reduced gravity on the moon would allow for a radio telescope far larger than any on Earth, which could significantly enhance the sensitivity of SETI searches. Ultimately the researchers concluded that a lunar radio observatory was too expensive compared to SETI telescopes that could be built on Earth.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But 40 years later, Michaud says that building a radio dish in a lunar crater may finally be cheap enough to pull off. One of the main drivers of this cost reduction is the advent of commercial launch providers like SpaceX and Rocket Lab, which have </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/cheaper-rockets-growing-the-human-family-in-space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dramatically lowered the cost of space access</a><span>. Another driver is NASA’s push to establish a permanent human presence on the moon, which has subsidized the development of a fleet of commercial lunar exploration vehicles. “There’s so much interest in going back to the moon,” says Michaud, who cited Blue Origin’s lunar lander and Rocket Lab’s Photon Lunar satellite as examples of technologies enabled by </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/nasas-first-puerto-rican-born-director-aims-for-a-moonshot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA’s Artemis program</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>A crux of the original vision for lunar SETI observatories was that it would require a human settlement on the moon to build and operate the radio dish. But robotic systems have improved enough that it may be possible to take humans out of the equation. This was clearly demonstrated in 2019 when China’s Chang’e 4 rover landed autonomously on the farside of the moon. These advancements in autonomous navigation have laid the foundation for a lunar radio observatory that is built entirely by robots.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>It sounds like science fiction, but earlier this year NASA’s Advanced Innovative Concepts program </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/lunar_crater_radio_telescope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">awarded one of it’s prestigious grants to Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to figure out a way to make it happen</a><span>. His idea is to use rovers to deploy wire mesh in a crater on the lunar farside and suspend a receiver over the dish. NIAC is all about funding high risk, high reward missions, and there’s no guarantee that Bandyopadhyay’s proposal will ever come to fruition. Still, addressing the technical problems associated with building a radio receiver on the farside of the moon is an important first step.</span></p></div><div><p><span>And Bandyopadhyay isn’t the only NASA-backed researcher contemplating a lunar radio observatory. Jack Burns, a radio astronomer at the University of Colorado, has also received a grant to study a mission concept for a radio telescope array called </span><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/project/lunar-farside/dr-jack-burns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FARSIDE</a><span>. Instead of using a crater as a dish, FARSIDE would deploy several smaller antennas across the lunar surface that would collectively form a large radio telescope. Both NASA studies are focused on radio astronomy rather than SETI, but Siemion sees the two disciplines as natural allies in the quest to establish an observatory on the lunar farside. SETI has piggybacked on other radio astronomy projects in the past—SERENDIP, for instance, opportunistically searched for ET signals during radio observation campaigns at a variety of telescopes—and it seems plausible that a similar arrangement could be made with an observatory on the moon.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Siemion acknowledged that there were certain technical challenges that would arise in a collaboration on a lunar radio observatory. The biggest issue, he says, is that a lot of radio astronomy is done at frequencies that don’t really require an observatory on the moon. “Radio …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We decided to adopt Gatsby for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s customer-facing documentation</a> - well, I should say that <em>I</em> decided. We were already using it successfully for a variety of static marketing content, and I knew it had a lot of hype, so after a brief proof-of-concept it seemed like a safe choice.</p>
<p>To help contextualize everything I’m about to say, it’s important to understand the scope of our usage. Sentry’s documentation is not as straightforward as you might think - in fact, there are over 3,000 pages as of writing. We have a large amount of templated content designed to render language-specific examples, as well as a variety of different types of documentation (user guides, help desk-y articles, code-rich technical docs). Originally we had extended Jekyll to support a lot of this, but Ruby isn’t widely used at Sentry (approximately 0% of the engineering team knows Ruby), and it had become a big mess of spaghetti code with slow build times.</p>
<p>I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.</p>
<h2>Adopting Gatsby</h2>
<p>So, enter Gatsby. It seemed fast, was built on React (we’re experts on that here, with our gigabyte-sized Sentry frontend app), and had a huge adoption (assumed future existence and stability). While we didn’t have the desire to use MDX, it also seemed like a positive outcome given we could more easily deal with some of the rich aspects of our docs site, without having to resort to 2010-era JavaScript. We assumed a bunch of the other features of Gatsby had value-add, but we didn’t have an immediate need. These were things like dynamic source data - thus the need for a GraphQL engine at all - as well as the large plug-in ecosystem.</p>
<p>We started by iteratively converting sections of the Jekyll site into Gatsby - running them side by side for a time. At one point we eventually bulk converted pages, and ripped off the band aid. At this point though it was becoming clear build times were a problem. You’d spend at least 5 minutes on image optimization alone, with no way to even disable that. Slowly but surely we were depleting the ozone later on re-optimizing images which had already been pre-optimized. Oh yeah, and we were crippling our iteration speed as well, since the build cache would invalidate under a variety of situations in early development.</p>
<p>Making this worse was how we deployed Gatsby. We started off leveraging what we had already done: deploying Jekyll with Docker onto our own infrastructure - effectively just proxied via a CDN. We continued that for a period of time, but deploy times were far too long - upwards of 30-40 minutes for everything to build. Eventually we moved over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which dropped it down closer to 10 minutes, but ultimately it can’t fix what it doesn’t control.</p>
<p>The build and deploy times were the first of many woes, and they represent what would become a continued frustration: a problem without a clear solution.</p>
<h2>Enter MDX</h2>
<p>Rewind time a little bit - this actually wasn’t our first project converting documentation to Gatsby. The proof-of-concept I mentioned earlier was actually our <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">developer documentation</a>, which I had migrated out of Notion to make public. While doing that we had gotten our hands dirty with some initial MDX usability and extensions - like our code samples which support toggling between different languages. This was one of the many things we needed to solve for, but MDX made it look like it’d be seemingly easy. No more jQuery DOM manipulation, just clean, encapsulated React components. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we hit rough spots with MDX. We were coming from Jekyll - which was Liquid-rendered (a template engine) markdown - to MDX - a strange offspring of Markdown and JSX, attempting all of the benefits of both, but missing by a fairly large margin. Let’s illustrate the crux of the issue with what has got to be one of the most common needs in a documentation system: an alert (or callout) component:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>info<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>You should know something important about this!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At face value this looks great. <code>Alert</code> is just a React component, and JSX is close enough to HTML that non-technical folks are able to pick it up fairly easily. Now the problem comes into play when you actually want to do something in the real world. Here’s an example from our API docs:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would you expect this to render? Both as an engineer and a non-engineer, I would expect - given this is markdown - that the “PUT/DELETE” text would be bold. It’s not. Because the MDX interpreter decides that once you enter a component block, it’s no longer markdown. So instead, we’re forced with this monstrosity <em>everywhere</em> in our documentation:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s two things you should note here: 1) we have to use this <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag, 2) we have to put empty new-lines to ensure paragraph tags render.</p>
<p>“But David”, you might say, “why don’t you just tell the <code>Alert</code> component to render the text as markdown?“. If only you could, or at least, if only I could have possibly found a way to achieve that as a user with minimal Gatsby or MDX internals knowledge.</p>
<p>To Gatsby, or at least to the MDX team’s credit, they recognize some of these problems and <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1041">there is work underway</a> on a 2.0 of the MDX dialect. While I’m confident they will improve things, I’m not confident MDX can ultimately succeed. It’s likely going to tradeoff one problem for another due to what it’s trying to achieve in the first place. It may get to a good place, but frankly, we need to step back and look at what we’re trying to solve, instead of creating a solution to a problem we don’t have. I don’t need JSX syntax in my markdown, I need a way to include JSX components. That might sound similar, but its quite a different thing.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s no reason I couldn’t simply use markdown syntax, and provide a way to achieve something akin to:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a-valid-html-tag-because-markdown-allows-that</span> <span>a-valid-property</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>a-value<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This wouldn’t force us to work around quirks in a new language (or interpreter even), and could be solved in a much more sustainable way. There are other alternatives as well. A generic way to render extensions in markdown could simply call into a React component, and avoid even trying to hijack HTML in the first place. While I don’t know what this might look like in Markdown, in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">Sphinx’s use of reStructuredText</a> this was solved early on with Directives:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.. my-directive:: some data
   :property-name: property-value</code></pre></div>
<p>I will hold out for MDX 2.0 and hope that finds a nice minimal-compromise place, but if not, we’ll be looking for a way to extend native markdown.</p>
<h2>A Broken DOM</h2>
<p>While we were able to work around the kinks of MDX, there’s been some things not yet solved. One of those is the layer which Gatsby uses to apply diffs to the DOM. I’m going to caveat this section with <em>I don’t know what the technical implementation is</em>, but I can make some assumptions given what I know of the domain. The system itself is intended to apply deltas to the DOM. This is naively also how React works, and I imagine under the hood it’s relying on React at least for part of it. We’ve had issues with this identified in two places already:</p>
<ul>
<li>progressive image loading</li>
<li>dynamic JSX components</li>
</ul>
<p>While they might not be linked to the same issue, they smell like they are, so we’re going to roll with it. The problem exhibits itself when you have a bunch of DOM that to a naive robot might look the same:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;baz&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobizbar&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In React it uses the graph to identify which node is which - effectively creating a unique entity ID based on its location. In cases where that’s difficult, React will warn you to explicitly bind a <code>key</code> attribute on each element to ensure it can more accurately deal with updates. While I would assume Gatsby is at least partially using React’s DOM engine, what we see in production effectively takes the above example, and replaces some of the content with other subsets of content - meaning it’s unable to accurately identify which nodes need updated.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this where a progressive image is replaced with an entirely different image that’s present near it on the page. We’ve also seen this happen for a dynamically loaded section of content (our language-selector include tags). While we’ve yet to identify a fix for the image tags, our other issue was resolved by literally changing a <code>div</code> tag to a different tag, one which is less commonly used (in our case, <code>section</code>).</p>
<p>All of the cases happen after Gatsby’s initial static render and exist only when applying some form of delta.</p>
<h2>Let’s Talk GraphQL</h2>
<p>It’s a static website generator. It literally does not need GraphQL all over the place. While there are few instances in the real world where that is valuable, it shouldn’t require a GraphQL API to read objects that are already in memory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend the energy to hammer this in, but take a look at Jared Palmer’s <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs">Gatsby vs. Next.js</a> as it echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, let’s actually not talk about GraphQL, but all its done is create complexity for us.</p>
<h2>Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>There’s a number of other things we’ve found fairly frustrating at this point, but this post is already getting long, so I’m choosing to summarize them.</p></section></div>

<p>This week, we continue our four-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, III, IV) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week we took our ore and smelted it into a rough, spongy mass of iron called a bloom; this week we’re going to go through the processes to reshape that bloom first into a consolidated billet, then into a bar that is useful for forging and finally into some useful final object.</p>



<p>I want to stress at the outset that we are not going to cover anything close to the whole of blacksmithing practice in this post.  Blacksmithing is fairly complex and any given object, shape or tool is going to have its own set of processes and techniques to produce the required shape at the required hardness and malleability characteristics.  If you <em>are</em> interested in that sort of information, I recommend A.W. Bealer’s <em>The Art of Blacksmithing</em> (1969) as a fairly good starting point, though there is no substitute to speaking with a practicing blacksmith.</p>

<h2>Heat, Hammers and Hardness</h2>



<p>There are a few basic behaviors of iron that fundamentally control what blacksmiths are going to do with it in this stage.  To begin with, we need to introduce some terminology to avoid this coming confusing: a given piece of metal can be <em>hard</em> (resistant to deformation) or <em>soft</em>; they can also be <em>ductile </em>(able to deform significantly before breaking) or <em>brittle</em> (likely to break without deformation).  This is easiest to understand at the extremes: a soft, brittle material (like a thin wooden dowel) takes very little energy and breaks immediately without behind, while a hard, ductile material (the same dowel, made of spring-steel) bends more easily under stress but resists breaking.  But it is also possible to hard hard brittle materials (pottery being a classic example) which fiercely resist deforming but break catastrophically the moment they exceed their tolerances or a soft, ductile material (think wet-noodle) which bends very easily.</p>



<p>(I should note that all of these factors are, in fact, very complex – far more complex than we are going to discuss.  In particular, as I understand it, some of what I am using ‘hardness’ to describe also falls under the related category of yield strength.  Hopefully you will all pardon the necessary simplification; if it makes you feel any better, ancient blacksmiths didn’t understand how any of this worked either, only that it worked.)</p>



<p>Of course these treats are not binaries but a spectrum.  Materials have a degree of hardness or ductility; as we’ll see, these are not quite <em>opposed</em>, but changing one does change the other – increasing hardness often reduces ductility.</p>



<p>The sort of things that pre-modern people are going to want to be made in iron are going to have fairly tight tolerances for these sorts of things.  Objects that had wide tolerances (that is, things which could be weak or a little bendy or didn’t have to take much force) got made out of other cheaper, easier materials like ceramics, stone or wood; metals were really only used for things that had to be both strong and relatively light for precisely the reasons we’ve seen: they were too expensive for anything else.  <strong>That means that a blacksmith doesn’t merely need to bring the metal to the right shape but also to the right <em>characteristics</em></strong><em><strong>.</strong>  </em>Some tools would need to finish up being quite hard (like the tip of a pick, or the edge of a blade), while others needed to be able to bend to absorb strain (like the core of a blade or the back of a saw).</p>



<p>Keep all of that in mind as we discuss:</p>



<h2>Forge Techniques</h2>



<p>I realize this is a long aside to leave our bloom waiting, but as we’ll see, the remaining steps share a basic set of techniques, making it easier to discuss those techniques together.</p>



<p>Fundamentally, each stage of forging iron revolves around a basic cycle: <strong>by heating the metal, the smith makes it soft enough to <em>work</em> </strong>(that is, hammer into shape).  Technically, it is possible to shape relatively thin masses of iron by hammering when cold (this is called cold-working) but in contrast to other metals (tin, copper and bronze all come to mind) nearly all serious iron-working was done ‘hot.’  In smithing terminology, each of these cycles is referred to as a ‘heat’ – the more heats a given project requires, the more fuel it is going to consume, the longer and more expensive it is going to be (but a skilled smith can often finish the work in fewer heats than an unskilled smith).</p>

An assistant mans the bellows on the forge to maintain the temperature.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A modern blacksmith can gauge the temperature of a metal using sophisticated modern thermometers, but pre-modern smiths had no recourse to such things (and most traditional smiths I’ve met don’t use them anyway).  Instead, the temperature of the metal is gauged by looking at its <em>color</em>: as things get hotter, they glow from brown to dark red through to a light red into yellow and then finally white.  For iron heated in a forge, a blacksmith can control the temperature of the forge’s fire by controlling the air-input through the bellows (pushing in more air means more combustion, which means more heat, but also more fuel consumed).  As we’ve seen, charcoal (and we will need to use charcoal, not wood, to hit the necessary heat required), while not cripplingly expensive, was not trivial to produce either.  A skilled smith is thus going to try to do the work in as few heats as possible and not excessively hot either (there are, in fact, other reasons to avoid excessive heats, this is just one).</p>



<p>One hot the metal can be shaped by hammering.  The thickness of a bar of metal could be thickened by <em>upsetting</em> (heating the center of the bar and them hammering down on it like a nail to compress the center, causing it to thicken) or thinned by <em>drawing</em> (hammering out the metal to create a longer, thinner shape).  If the required shape needed the metal to be bent it could be heated and bent either over the side of the anvil or against a tool; many anvils had (and still have) a notch in the back where such a tool could be fitted.  A good example of this kind of thing would be hammering out a sheet of iron over a dome-shape to create the bowl of a helmet (a task known as ‘raising’ or ‘sinking’ depending on precisely how it is done).  A mass of iron can also be divided by heating it at the intended cutting point and then using a hammer and chisel to cut through the hot, soft metal.</p>



<p>But for understanding the entire process, the most important of these operations is the<strong> <em>fire weld</em></strong>.  Much like bloomery furnaces, the forges available to pre-modern blacksmiths could not reach the temperatures necessary to melt or cast iron, but it was necessary to be able to join smaller bits of iron into larger ones which was done through a fire weld (sometimes called a forge weld).  In this process, the iron is heated very hot, typically to a ‘yellow’ or ‘white’ heat (around 1100 °C).  The temperature range for the operation is quite precise: too cold and the iron will not weld, too hot and it will ‘burn’ making the weld brittle.  Once at the right temperature, the two pieces of iron are put next to each other and hammered into each other with heavy blows.  If done properly, the two pieces of metal join completely, leaving a weld that is as strong as every other part of the bar.</p>

<p>That’s not all there is to say about these processes (we’ll come back to them in a moment) but we now have enough of the basics to begin processing our bloom.</p>



<h2>From Bloom to Billet to Bar</h2>



<p>As you may recall, when we finished our process last time, we ended with a ‘bloom’ of iron: a spongy mass of pure, metallic iron interspersed with inclusions of waste materials called slag:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="4630" data-permalink="https://acoup.blog/1024px-iron_bloom/" data-orig-file="https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,853" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1024px-iron_bloom" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg?w=1024" src="https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg 1024w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg?w=150 150w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg?w=300 300w, https://acoupdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/1024px-iron_bloom.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The iron of the bloom itself is also likely to be quite brittle because of these slag inclusions.  This isn’t a product that can be sent directly to a blacksmith.  It needs to be consolidated first into a billet and most of that slag needs to be forced out, both of which can be achieved via liberal application of <strong>fire welding</strong>.</p>



<p>This step is sometimes called <strong>bloomsmithing</strong>.  The bloom is heated to roughly 1100 °C (gauged, as above, by the color of the iron) – it seems plausible that it may have been broken up into smaller chunks to make this more useful – and then hammered into a single mass through a series of fire welds.  We’re not very well informed how this was done in the ancient world (save ‘with hammers’) because bloomsmithing doesn’t tend to leave a lot of evidence for us to observe.  The end shape of the process was generally a very thick rectangular bar called a <strong>billet</strong>, ready for relatively easy transport.</p>



<p>This process has some advantages and disadvantages, beyond merely shaping the metal into a more usable and transportable form.  Remember that our bloom contains a lot of material which isn’t iron (the slag); fire welding, especially when repeated, tends to expel this slag – as the iron is compressed in the weld, the slag is forced out.  There is some debate (note Sim &amp; Kaminski, <em>op. cit.</em>) if this process is sufficient to explain the <em>very</em> low slag counts seen in high quality weapons and armor, but it is certainly true that fire welding reduces the overall slag count.  That …</p></div></div>

    <p><em>Before reading the post</em></p>

<p>Now that I have mentioned the name of a country in the title, please read the following points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I am an Indian and have been living in the country since my birth.</li>
  <li>I do not claim to be right on all of this and there are many anecdotal generalisations here. Somethings are more like human problems instead of Indian problems <strong>but</strong> just the sheer number of people here puts India on everyone’s radar.</li>
  <li>This post is NOT to denigrate India. It is definitely critical of some of its social and psychological aspects. As a proof for that I want to mention that I am writing a series on the wisdom of ancient Indian philosophical ideas here: <a href="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/2020/06/25/source-0/">Source [0]</a>, just so you know that I am not writing all my posts with the sole intention to show what is “wrong” with India. We should be brave enough to face the good and bad of it.</li>
  <li>It is a shame that I need to write this header in the first place. But the reality is with or without this, people will still get offended.</li>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>As most of you may know, <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> started on 1st October 2020. And as it with most things in human life, people came with <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/shitoberfest">different</a> ways to hack hacktoberfest to get the free t-shirt.</p>

<p>Now apart from the sheer number of spam PRs which were opened, copious amount of time is being spent by the comparatively small number of open source maintainers who have comment, close and label each individual PR.</p>

<p>I became aware of this happening from this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24643894">post</a>, and in a days time several more <a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama">posts</a> popped up. 
I got motivated (triggered?) to write this post when I saw the following on HN:</p>

<p><img src="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/assets/hacktober/hn_comment.png" alt="hn-comment"></p>

<p>After some investigation, I found the original claim to be true, <code>more than 60% of the spam PRs are coming from one country: India</code> and that is just 1 day after hacktoberfest started, I am sure the percentage will increase as days go by (unless DigitalOcean does something).</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>

<p><a href="https://joel.net/how-one-guy-ruined-hacktoberfest2020-drama">This</a> post talks about one Indian YouTube channel which apparently told people to open spammy PRs. After I looked around some people were claiming he was falsely accused, anyways the video is deleted now, so I can’t comment on that.</p>

<p>Anyways, it didn’t take long and I was able to find few more Indian YouTubers who were pretty directly promoting ways to open PRs to get those sweet T-Shirts. One created his own <a href="https://github.com/seeditsolution/cprogram/pulls">repo</a> and encouraged people to google different programs and copy-paste them into a new PR against the empty repo.</p>

<p>I do not want to focus on the <em>How</em>, you will find find plenty videos/blogs on it, I am sure some Indian YouTuber has started working on creating a video on it.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>One of the simplest explanation is that, DigitalOcean should have been very well anticipated that this is going to happen, after all they must have all the stats from the previous HacktoberFests.</p>

<p>We need to understand that Hacktoberfest is an marketing event. And all these spam and blogs posts around it is definitely serving their main purpose, there is no such thing as bad publicity indeed. Of course I could be totally wrong, all of this could be completely unintentional.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, coming to the Indian side of the ongoing issue. Out of all the countries why does India have the most spammy PRs ? As a seasoned armchair philosopher, the following are my thoughts on the “Why” of all this.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="the-signalling-problem">The Signalling Problem</h3>
<p>Whenever an online article/documentary/report claim to give a view into the “real” India, most of us (Indians) get offended.</p>

<p>I <em>was</em> in the bubble which was in the “offended” bucket for long time. The reason was simple: I, the people around me and the societal structures around me were all part of the same bubble. We do not have to worry about paying school fees or rent, we do not have worry about sending part of salary back home just so that our parents can buy groceries to survive..</p>

<p>I can go on and on, the overall gist is that I got offended in seeing what other people claim as “real” India, because that India was not part of my reality. Sure, I saw that when travelling from one place to another, saw that on news, read about that in the newspaper; but I was at a very safe distance from all of that.</p>

<p>These days, I try to not get offended when people say India has problem X or problem Y, because I realise I am living inside a cocoon where all of my needs are met, and one of the most serious issues my country is facing right now is <strike>witch-hunting </strike> nabbing the “drug mafia” amongst the Bollywood celebrities who allegedly murdered an actor by giving CBD oil (The absurdity of all this is unfathomable)</p>

<p>I mention all of this, because whenever I read posts which show India in some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24552047">bad light</a>, there is always someone somewhere who gives anecdotes of how that is not true.</p>

<p>Here are some facts: we have a culture of <strong>extreme signalling</strong>. Signalling is the core building block of our society, most people don’t even realise that how big we are into signalling until they study about “signalling” as a phenomena and start becoming conscious of it. You notice that in the way your parents view you, how you make choices, how people around you make choices.</p>

<p>Of course, people will say “that is not an Indian problem, signalling is just a social construct and literally everyone does that on some level”. I am not denying not that, the very fact that I am writing this post is a kind of signalling I am doing.</p>

<p>It is well known fact that India is one of the densest countries on our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-density?time=2017">planet</a>, extreme siginalling is just one of the consequences of the myriad social problems created by high population density. Signalling in an high density environment is now ever more important as the people you interact or the people who notice your activities/accomplishments are multiples higher than in any other place on the planet.</p>

<p>We people like the wear the “tightly knit society” as badge of honour, let me tell you this “tightly knit society” has done more harm than good. We Indian people have no India of the amount of mental harassment we all go through, because that is just normalized as being just phases of “life”.</p>

<p>The prevalence of extreme signalling brews the classic and infamous <em>herd mentality</em> in our minds. In middle school children have dreams to become a Pilot in the airforce, or maybe a Police officer, or maybe a Opera Singer ! But by the time of high school, everyone is just either on road to become an Engineer, a Doctor, a Lawyer, a Chartered Accountant …. or a <strong>failure</strong>. This may seem harsh but that’s how most of the society operates here in India.</p>

<p>Now once your track is chosen for you (or fortunately, if you get to choose the track), you have some set goals you “must” achieve because they guarantee monetary success with an extremely high probability. If you are Engineer, you need to get into IIT. If you are a Doctor, you need to get into AIIMS. If you are doing management, you need to get into IIM.</p>

<p>Now, if you are an Engineer then your success criteria is not just any IIT, it should be one of the top ones (Bombay, Delhi, Kharagpur, Roorkee) and not just any branch in IIT, it should be <em>Computer Science</em>. Because that’s how you get <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/dec/04/five-iitians-bag-pay-packages-of-over-rs-15-crore-2071120.html">Rs 1.5 crore “packages” (equivalent to 200K USD)</a>.</p>

<p>You can give me examples of how not all IIT toppers choose “Computer Science”, but that’s not the point, for the vast majority of people (more than a million), the success criteria is: getting Computer Science at IIT Bombay.</p>

<p>As might know (or have guessed) getting a seat in IIT Bombay is next to impossible for more than 99% people giving IIT, so they “lower” their goal by aiming for other IITs, but “Computer Science” remains the top priority.</p>

<h3 id="the-jugaad-mentality">The Jugaad mentality</h3>
<p>Hacking systems is so ingrained in our society that we have a word for it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad">Jugaad</a>. The whole scene with Hacktoberfest is just a demo of our Jugaad skills. Wait till you find out that <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/inside-indias-fake-research-paper-shops-pay-publish-profit-5265402">most of the research papers</a> published in India are <a href="https://scroll.in/article/908230/indian-academics-lead-the-world-in-publishing-in-fake-journals-tarring-the-whole-education-sector">fake</a>. Even the orthodontist I was visiting for my checkup turned out to be fake and had forged her certificates (as told by by one other dentist).</p>

<p>The coaching industry actively promotes “cracking” these exams, and I am so tired writing on that topic that I do not want to write more about it here. Refer to my post on this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coding-interviewing-coaching-industry-prologue-pulkit-sharma?articleId=6662006663559684097">here</a>. Some children start joining these coaching classes from as low as 5th grade! (apart from doing regular school), just to be able to “crack” the IITs after 7-8 years !</p>

<p>Now how is coaching industry a Jugaad ? Simply because from the point of view of IITs, attending regular school should be enough to prep you for the exams (I think). These coaching industries have made the process significantly harder as you can’t even hope of getting a low tier IIT without attending the coaching classes.</p>

<p>The IIT coaching industry is minting fat cheques out of this entire situation, look at these ads on the front page of the news paper. These ads create a vicious cycle by reinforcing the core “signalling” construct of our society.</p>

<p><img src="https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/assets/hacktober/paper_3.png" alt="hn-comment"></p>

<p>Do not quote me on this, but I think the IIT coaching industries make more <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/education/news/iits-iisc-say-that-patchy-funding-is-delaying-institute-of-eminence-plans/articleshow/72103538.cms">money than the IITs</a> themselves. I understand the purpose of IITs is not to directly generate money, but if it would have more resources they can probably improve the infrastructure, employ better professors and improve the overall level of education.</p>

<p>For vast majority of engineers in India, Computer Science is  one of the subjects you study in order to succeed in life. Just like you study Chemistry, you “study” Computer Science and once you learn all the “concepts”, you get a good job. (Apologies for so many quoted words, I can’t help putting them in quotes because they carry so much weight for me).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>There are a few things you need to consider when you’re looking to buy a good dumb TV. Let’s take a closer look at each of them.</p><h3>Screen size</h3><p>The biggest challenge you will face when you’re looking for a good dumb TV is getting a good screen size. You will soon realize that there are not a lot of dumb TVs that come in the latest size standards for home entertainment.</p><p>A lot of dumb TVs only have 30-40-inch screens. If this size works for you, then you are in luck. However, in today’s standards, 30-40 inches is not enough screen real estate.</p><p>You may want to find something with at least a 50-inch screen. The good news is that they do exist and, according to our research, you can even go up to 65 inches.</p><p><strong>If you’re in hurry, here’s our recommendations</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Image</th><th>Product</th><th>Features</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr id="product-723"><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419R0211LBL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419R0211LBL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 65 Inches 4K UHD LED TV"></a></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sceptre 65 Inches 4K UHD LED TV</a></td><td><div><ul><li>Bright LED display and sharp contrast</li><li>65-inch 4K UHD, HDR and MEMC120</li><li>HDMI ports, component ports, optical and line audio outputs</li></ul></div></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0198XNF6U?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-style="">Check Price On Amazon</a></td></tr><tr id="product-724"><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S-2IYjHFL.jpg" data-src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51S-2IYjHFL.jpg" alt="Sceptre 50"></a></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sceptre 50″ 4K UHD Ultra Slim LED TV</a></td><td><div><ul><li>50-inch screen that supports 4K UHD</li><li>Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) to stream videos from a smartphone</li><li>Stunning colors and image contrast</li></ul></div></td><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PW4M13Y?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-style="">Check Price On Amazon</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Input ports</h3><p>Another thing that turns a regular dumb TV into a good dumb TV is the number of input ports it has. Since your dumb TV relies on external devices for display content, you will want several ports to ensure that you can plug in all your devices.</p><p>Having several input ports will allow you to switch between devices without having to physically unplug and plug them. Reaching behind your TV to do this can be very inconvenient.</p><p>HDMI ports are what most external devices today use. You will want at least 3 HDMI ports on your dumb TV. Having more HDMI ports will be better, especially if you’re thinking about getting a few more external devices.</p><h3>Monitors</h3><p>When looking for a good dumb TV, people often make the mistake of looking in the monitor category. A monitor may work for you, but there are a couple of reasons why they may not work as well as a TV.</p><p><a href="https://pointerclicker.com/how-to-clean-a-matte-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monitor displays</a> are relatively darker than TV displays. This is because monitors are designed for people who sit up close.</p><p>It may not be a problem when you’re watching a movie in a dark room. If you watch with the windows open during the day, however, your monitor won’t be able to produce enough brightness to give you pleasant viewing experience.</p><p>Monitors also do not come with a TV tuner. This will be a problem if you’re thinking about watching local channels.</p><h2><span id="Does_a_great_dumb_TV_exist_in_2020">Does a great dumb TV exist in 2020?</span></h2><p>The short answer is yes. Although smart TVs are more popular, there are still a few great dumb TVs being manufactured.</p><p>You can visit your local electronic shop or search for one online. Below are some of our dumb TV recommendations.</p><h2><span id="Editors_recommendations">Editor’s recommendations</span></h2><p>We’ve put together a shortlist of our top dumb TV picks. Take a moment to review each one so you can make a better decision when you plan to make a purchase.</p><h3>1. Sceptre 50” 4K UHD (U518CV-UM)</h3> <p>Sceptre sells quite a number of dumb TVs as well as smart TVs. This particular one has a large 50-inch screen that supports 4K UHD.</p><p>It also comes with Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) that allows you to stream videos from your smartphone. Sceptre also boasts about its stunning colors and image contrast.</p><h3 id="title"><span id="productTitle">2.

It is going to cost you more, but it also comes with additional features.</p><p>It has a bright <a href="https://pointerclicker.com/can-you-use-a-laser-pointer-on-a-tv-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED display</a> and a sharp contrast. Its UHD upscaling will enhance your SD or HD videos so they display excellently in 4K. It also comes with HDR and MEMC120 to give you the best viewing experience.</p><p>This particular TV also has great connectivity options. HDMI ports, component ports, optical and line audio outputs. You won’t be needing additional ports with this TV.</p><h2><span id="What_is_the_dumb_TV">What is the dumb TV?</span></h2><p>When you walk through the video section in an electronic shop, you’re going to find an array of different TVs. Most of the newer ones you will have large high definition screens. And almost all of them are going to be smart TVs.</p><p>Smart TVs have taken over the home entertainment industry by storm. To the point where it has become more difficult to find one that does not have smart features. TVs lacking smart features are also called dumb TVs.</p><p>Dumb TVs are display screens with a built-in TV tuner. They also come with different input ports where you can input video information from an HDTV antenna, Blu-ray player, etc. The most common input ports are HDMI and AV.</p><p>What makes a dumb TV “dumb”? The difference between a dumb TV and a smart TV is that the former does not come with an operating system. It relies on external devices to convert data into video information that it can display.</p><p>All televisions that were manufactured before the invention of smart TVs are dumb TVs. Dumb TVs are still being manufactured today for various reasons, although they are less popular.</p><p>Smart TVs, on the other hand, are more like smartphones or computers. They come with an operating system and a handful of pre-installed apps. You can connect them directly to the internet and stream videos on YouTube, Netflix, and other popular platforms.</p><h2><span id="Why_do_people_need_a_dumb_TV_without_smart_features">Why do people need a dumb TV without smart features?</span></h2><p>As you learn more about what smart TVs offer, you may start to wonder why anyone would want to settle for a dumb TV. Smart TVs are more convenient, and they offer so many useful features.</p><p>While the popularity of smart TV increases, there are quite a few people who still prefer dumb TVs. There are a few reasons why you might opt to get a dumb TV. Let’s take a closer look at each of those reasons in more detail.</p><h3>Security and privacy</h3><p>When it comes to the internet, security and privacy are huge topics. There have been countless horror stories that resulted from having personal devices connected to the internet. If you’re connected, there is always going to be some sort of risk.</p><p>Smart TVs are said to be one of the most vulnerable to hacking and data theft. The FBI has even issued a warning of the risks.</p><p>One of the reasons for this is that smart TVs use automatic content recognition or ACR. ACR gathers information about what you watch and sends it back to the manufacturer. With this information, more relative ads can be shown when you’re browsing for something to watch.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are times when a third party receives the information captured by ACR. These third parties can do whatever they want with that information.</p><p>Many newer smart TVs also come with webcams and microphones. These can be used by hackers to spy on you while you’re watching your favorite show.</p><p>Many people are aware of the dangers of this. This is one of the main reasons there are still quite a few people who opt to get dumb TVs instead of TVs with smart features.</p><h3>Better set-top and stick options</h3><p>Another reason why people purchase dumb TVs is that they prefer to use other TV stick and set-top devices. These devices don’t cost a lot of money and they often work better than smart TVs.</p><p>A few of the more popular ones are the <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Roku Streaming Stick+" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B075XLWML4" data-aawp-product-title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls  updated for 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">Roku Streaming Stick+</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Roku Streaming Stick+" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B075XLWML4" data-aawp-product-title="Roku Streaming Stick+ | HD/4K/HDR Streaming Device with Long-range Wireless and Voice Remote with TV Controls  updated for 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"><span></span></a></span>, <span><span>No products found.</span></span>, <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791TX5P5?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Amazon Fire TV Stick" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B0791TX5P5" data-aawp-product-title="Fire TV Stick streaming media player with Alexa built in includes Alexa Voice Remote HD easy set-up released 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791TX5P5?tag=pointerclicke-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Amazon Fire TV Stick" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-aawp-product-id="B0791TX5P5" data-aawp-product-title="Fire TV Stick streaming media player with Alexa built in includes Alexa Voice Remote HD easy set-up released 2019" data-aawp-click-tracking="true"><span></span></a></span>, and <span><span>No products found.</span></span>. There are many more options in the market to choose from.</p><p>These devices connect to your WI-FI and allow you to stream content on popular platforms such as Netflix and YouTube.</p><p>All these devices have seamless UI’s and tons of different apps and features. They also come with <a href="https://pointerclicker.com/presentation-pointers-lcd-tv-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remote controls</a> that support voice commands.</p><p>One feature many people find very useful in these devices is the casting feature. It allows you to use your TV as a larger display for your smartphone. You can play videos, view images, and browse the web on your smartphone and have it cast onto your TV.</p><p>You should also remember that technology is advancing a lot quicker than ever before. Your brand-new smart TV will be outdated in just a couple of years. The only way you’re going to be able to keep up with new features and security fixes is to buy a new TV.</p><p>You won’t need to replace your dumb TV to stay updated. All you need to do is purchase the latest stick or set-top device. You can get brand-new ones that already come with voice control for an affordable price.</p><p>Check out this video to learn more about stick and set-top devices.</p><div title="4K Streaming Device Round Up 2019: Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Roku vs Fire TV, Which is best for you?"><div id="WYL_H2Bq9X3a41A"><div id="lyte_H2Bq9X3a41A" data-src="https://pointerclicker.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FH2Bq9X3a41A%2Fhqdefault.jpg"><div><p>4K Streaming Device Round Up 2019: Apple TV vs Chromecast vs Roku vs Fire TV, Which is best for you?</p></div></div></div></div><h3>Interface issues on smart TVs</h3><p>When you use your smartphone or computer, you have two main input sources: pointing and typing. You don’t have either of those in a smart TV interface.</p><p>For the most part, you will use your TV’s remote to click through menus and an onscreen keyboard for typing. It will take you quite a number of button presses to type something into your TV’s search service.</p><p>Some smart TVs also come with poorly designed interfaces. It will take a lot of time trying to navigate around the interface.</p><p>On the other hand, the interfaces that come with newer sticks and set-box devices are more seamless. They also include voice commands and many support keyboard input from your smartphone.</p><h3>Unreliable apps on smart TVs</h3><p>App developers today need to work harder when it comes to compatibility. They need to make sure apps work well with smartphones, browsers, stick and set-top devices, smart TVs and more. Unfortunately, smart TVs are often the last priority.</p><p>This leaves smart TVs with unreliable apps that may crash or freeze. Older smart TVs may also not be compatible with app updates.</p><h2><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Although smart TVs are the most popular choice, there are still a few reasons why you might opt to get a dumb TV. The good news is that there are still quite a few of them being manufactured.</p><p>It may be more challenging to find a good dumb TV, but there’s a good chance a few of them are being sold at your nearest electronics shop. If you want more options, finding them online will be your best bet.</p><p>You can check out online shops such as Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart, and Costco. You may also visit manufacturer websites and look through their …</p></div></div>

<p><em>Merlin Sheldrake, 32, earned his Ph.D. in tropical ecology at the University of Cambridge for his research into underground fungal networks in the tropical forests of Panama. Since then, he has not lost his fascination for them. He is the author of "Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures," which was published in early September.</em></p>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Dr. Sheldrake, we are here in London's Hampstead Heath. This place, you write in your book, means more to you than any other. Why is that?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;I grew up here. This is where I learned to walk. Later, I climbed trees here, and still later, I had parties with friends. And my interest in nature has been incubated by this place.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>Your interest in nature in general, or fungi in particular?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Both. I've always been particularly interested in how things transform, how they grow and decompose. I was amazed how piles of leaves disappear over time. How did this transformation come about without me being able to see anything? Composting, I understood, is largely the work of fungi.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>For most people, nature is primarily made up of plants and animals. What role do fungi play in between those two realms?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Fungi are of enormous importance. The basic principle of ecology is the relationships between organisms - and fungi form connections between organisms and so embody this idea.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>If fungi are so important, why don’t we see them all over the place?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, fungi are everywhere. Just take this leaf: Between tens and hundreds of species of fungi live on and in it. No plant has ever been found in nature which does not have fungi in its leaves and in its shoots. Or take the roots of the grass we are walking on, the rotting twigs, the soil under our feet: There are fungi everywhere. You have yeast all over your body, in the lining of your ears, in your nostrils. Even in the air: At this moment, you are breathing fungi. Fifty million tons of fungal spores are floating in the atmosphere, the largest source of living particles in the air. And they change the weather by causing water droplets to form.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>If fungi are so ubiquitous, why we know so little about them?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;There are many reasons. The most obvious one is access. The fungus we see is nothing more than the fruit of the organism itself. The mycelium network that belongs to it is buried in the ground. It is as if we only saw acorns for one moment every year, but we couldn't see the magnificent oak trees.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Do even scientists underestimate the importance of fungi?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;They did so for a long time, at least. Until the 1960s, fungi were thought to be plants. Only then did they gain taxonomical independence. The new sequencing techniques have changed that. Today, we can read the DNA in every teaspoon of soil and find out who is there.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>And? What does one find?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;The kingdom of fungi is vast. There are six times more species of fungi than of plants, and only 6 to 8 percent of them have even been described. We still know so little! ! Just one thing is clear: There are many ways to be a fungus.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is perhaps the lack of appreciation for fungi because of the fact that they are not very nutritious and often even poisonous?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Many people think like that. But in fact, many mushrooms contain important minerals and they have a high content of antioxidants. They produce an amazing variety of substances that affect cancer, viruses or our immune system. And mushrooms are high in protein. Truffles are a good example of an edible fungus. After all, they want to be eaten. Truffles sit deep in the ground where no wind can spread their spores. They attract animals with a very subtle mixture of odors, so that these animals then eat them and spread their spores.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Some mushrooms lure us with substances that have a direct effect on our consciousness ...</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, about 200 fungal species contain psilocybin, a substance that people have been interested in because of its strong psychedelic effects.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Such mushrooms cause hallucination and change the way we think. How do mushrooms benefit from making psychedelic drugs for humans?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;We don’t know. The first mushrooms to make psilocybin lived 75 million years ago, long before humans arose. But the receptors that this substance binds to can also be found in many animals. Does psilocybin change the behavior of certain insects in a way that induces them to spread fungal spores? Or do they change the behavior of insects in a way that deters them from eating the mushrooms?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Have you personally tried the effects of psychedelic mushrooms?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, under their influence I realized that most of my consciousness was unknown to me. It was as if I had spent my life in a garden until then, and now I suddenly discovered that this garden has a gate through which I can enter a strange and wonderful forest, that was largely unknown to me.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Does the gate disappear once the effects of psilocybin fade away?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Not necessarily. Once you know that this forest exists, it is much easier to find your way into it.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;You even took part in a scientific study.</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, though it was LSD tested in that study. But both substances have similar effects. Among other things, it was to be examined whether LSD promotes creativity. Each participant had to name a problem they were currently working on and, under the influence of LSD, &nbsp;we were to try to solve that problem.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;And?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp; I found the effects of LSD very helpful in allowing me to approach questions from new angles and imagine the relationships between plant and fungus from different points of view.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;You attribute cognitive abilities to fungi. What makes you think so?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm interested in the way fungi perceive their environment and how they react to it. Information is continuously flowing through their decentralized bodies.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;What do fungi perceive?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Most importantly, they have extremely diverse chemical sensors. A fungus can be seen as a large, chemically sensitive membrane, so to speak, as one big olfactory epithelium. But many mushrooms can also perceive light and they are sensitive to gravity, to changes in temperature and to changes in pressure.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;So the fungi under our feet can sense that we are here?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong> Some fungi would detect the pressure of our steps, yes. And now the question is, how do they process all this information without a brain and how do they translate it into behavior, into action?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Action? Behavior? What do fungi do?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Fungi are quite active. Take hunting, for example.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Excuse me? Mushrooms can hunt?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. When food becomes scarce, some fungi can switch to a hunting mode. They build traps consisting of sticky loops or poisonous droplets. And with special substances, they lure nematodes into these traps.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is this really "behavior" of the kind we see in animals?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Well, we can run away from danger, fungi have to face it. Therefore, they defend themselves with the help of chemicals, or they regenerate. But that doesn't change the fact that fungi do make decisions, just as we do.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;What kind of decisions?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Fungi have many options: where to grow, what to eat, what nutrients to transport, whether to withdraw and when to hunt nematodes. Each fungus forms thousands of so-called hyphae - tiny tubes that can either grow, divide or fuse.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;If fungi make decisions, are they also capable of solving problems?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. For example, their growth follows very efficient navigation algorithms. There are various experiments in which fungi very rapidly found the shortest route through a maze.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;If fungi are, as you claim, complex information processing networks, are they essentially a kind of brain?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;No, I wouldn’t say that. But you are right: Neurons are tip-growing, electrically excitable, network-forming cells. And so are fungal cells.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;So mushrooms have a form of intelligence?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on your definition of "intelligence." In a broad sense, all organisms show intelligence, albeit to different degrees. The study of cognition and intelligence arose from the study of the human mind. This resulted in a very human- and brain-centered view. I find it refreshing to extend these considerations to organisms that do not have brains. We shouldn't use ourselves as the yardstick to judge everything else in this world.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Is there still a lot to discover in the field of fungi cognition?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>Absolutely. Little is known about how fungi coordinate their behavior. We don't know the mechanisms by which they pass signals around. We've not fully understood the basic biology of mycelial growth.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:&nbsp;</strong>But we do know a lot about the symbiotic relationship between mushrooms and plants …</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:&nbsp;</strong>… exactly, via the mycorrhiza, through which the fungus supplies the plant with minerals such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and the plant in turn provides the fungus with energy-rich sugars.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;How important is this symbiosis? If all fungi were wiped out in this forest floor, could the trees survive?</p><p><strong>Sheldrake:</strong>&nbsp;No. They would be prone to disease, just as we would be if it weren't for the bacteria in our intestines. This microbiome keeps us healthy. In this sense, soil is sort of the gut of our planet.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong>&nbsp;Many ecologists are enthusiastic about the "Wood Wide Web," by which trees are mysteriously connected via the fungi in the soil and allegedly even communicate via this …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>If you work in tech, you probably have a YubiKey. I have this one, the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5c-nano/">YubiKey 5C Nano</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano.jpg" alt="YubiKey 5C Nano"></p>

<p>If you don’t work in tech but primarily work on your laptop, you probably <em>should</em> have a YubiKey. And if you work on a political campaign or as a journalist, you should definitely have one (or something similar). Talk to your IT Security department about that. This post will mostly be about something your IT Security department doesn’t want to hear about, though, so maybe don’t mention it to them.</p>

<p>YubiKeys act as two-factor authentication. This means that after you log-in to a system with your username and password, the system requires you to authorize in a second way as well. This way if your login credentials are compromised, the attacker would also have to compromise the second form of authentication, which is harder.</p>

<p>There are different forms of two-factor authentication - a common one is that a website will ask you to scan a QR code with the Google Authenticator app (or similar) on your phone which will generate 6 digit codes. The way this works is that the server and the app both have a shared secret. The phone generates codes based on that secret and the current timestamp and the server generates the same codes and sees if they match.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/qr-code.png" alt="QR Code"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/authenticator.png" alt="Google Authenticator"></p>

<p>Another one is SMS-based 2FA, which is pretty widely regarded as insecure. In this case, the server generates a code and sends it to your phone via SMS. The reason it’s considered insecure is that an attack exists called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM-jacking</a> where someone convinces a cell phone carrier to port a number to a new SIM card, effectively directing all SMS traffic to their phone instead of yours.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/wells.jpg" alt="Wells Fargo"></p>

<p>YubiKeys are small devices that plug in to the USB port of your computer and emulate a keyboard. When tapped, they emit a one-time password (OTP) which can be then verified by a validation server. A private key exists on the device which is used to sign information, but it can never leave the device because it is stored in a tamper-resistant environment.</p>

<p>The YubiKey that I use is designed to always sit in a USB port of my laptop, so whenever I would take my laptop from my desk to a conference room or to another office, it was always available. But like many new remote workers, my laptop never leaves my desk anymore. I have it hooked up to an external monitor and to save some desk space, I have it in clamshell mode sitting vertically on a stand.</p>

<p>This makes tapping the YubiKey difficult, especially when I store my laptop far away from my keyboard and mouse. I solved this by buying a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DMMW4J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">USB-C extension cable</a>, which brought the YubiKey closer to my keyboard.</p>

<p>One thing I haven’t mentioned about the YubiKey 5C Nano is that it’s kind of difficult to tap, even without the distance issues. The target area that you need to touch is extremely small:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/nano-big.png" alt="YubiKey 5C Nano"></p>

<p>One of the features of the YubiKey is that the little metal strip determines that it is being tapped by a human - this prevents it from being accidentally triggered by bumping your laptop into something, but if you’ve ever seen a one-time password in a Slack channel or Google Doc like <code>tlerefhcvijlngibueiiuhkeibbcbecehvjiklltnbbl</code>, you know it isn’t a perfect system. I would estimate that 1 in 5 times that I attempt to trigger it, it doesn’t register.</p>

<p>A lot of thought has gone into ensuring that the YubiKey can’t be triggered from software on the computer itself.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, I’d like to acknowledge the reasons for this. If a remote attacker were to compromise your laptop, being able to trigger the YubiKey from software on the computer defeats the whole point of using the YubiKey. But I think we always make tradeoffs between security and convenience - for example, you often don’t have to enter your YubiKey every time you access a system, some systems will only ask you once and not ask you again on subsequent logins for a certain amount of time. When you use a 2FA system and it gives you “backup codes”, do you always print those out and store them in a safe location? Everyone should figure out what level of security and convenience they are okay with.</p>

<p>With that being said, let’s talk about how you could trigger a YubiKey with software.</p>



<p>I’ve been calling this mechanism <strong>The Finger</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>First, we need some way for the computer to talk to <strong>The Finger</strong>. I had a bunch of these <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076F53B6S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">IZOKEE D1 Mini</a> development boards lying around, they are smaller versions of boards that use the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a> chip found in a lot of IoT devices.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/d1-mini.jpg" alt="IZOKEE D1 Mini"></p>

<p>We can connect this to the laptop and talk to it over USB serial, but since it has WiFi, we can also just run a webserver on it and send it HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Next, we need some way to push <strong>The Finger</strong> towards the Yubikey. After a little googling, I found that the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CP18J4A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">28BYJ-48 stepper motor</a> interfaces well with the D1 Mini board.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.jpg" alt="stepper motor"></p>

<p>Stepper motors convert electrical pulses into mechanical rotation and the D1 Mini has pins for sending electrical pulses.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor.gif" alt="stepper motor"></p>

<p>But stepper motors rotate and we mostly just need to poke in a straight direction. So I searched on Thingiverse for “28BYJ-48” and found this: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3593641">28BYJ-48 Motor Halter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/stepper-motor-case.jpg" alt="28BYJ-48 Motor Halter"></p>

<p>This attaches a gear to the motor which can guide a long rack forward and backward. But if we’re going to push a long plastic thing toward the YubiKey, it might as well look like a finger. Back to Thingiverse, this time searching for “finger” and I found this model someone made for Halloween:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_model.jpg" alt="finger"></p>

<p>I opened up these two models in Fusion 360 and used an advanced CAD technique called “smooshing”, resulting in this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/finger_smoosh.png" alt="finger"></p>

<p>Next, I exported the smooshed STL and 3D printed it in <a href="https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/715-prusament-pla-lipstick-red-1kg.html">Prusament PLA Lipstick Red</a> because that’s what I happened to have in my printer at the time. Then I took the plastic finger and touched the YubiKey which.. didn’t do anything. I picked up a metal screw on my desk and touched the YubiKey, which immediately spit out a OTP. So then I took the finger and secured it to my desk with a vise and drilled a small hole in it, then screwed the metal screw into it and touched it to the YubiKey, which again did nothing.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/vise.jpg" alt="vise"></p>

<p>That’s when I realized that I’m an idiot and that when I had touched the metal screw to the Yubikey, it was just transmitting the electrical charge from my body to the metal screw, which then transmitted it to the capacitive touch sensor on the YubiKey. So how could I trick the capacitive touch sensor into thinking it was a real finger?</p>

<p>I guessed that the way that capacitive touch sensors work is that they’re measuring your body’s capacitance to ground, so if we just hook up the sensor directly towards ground, it’ll think that its really conductive or at least conductive enough for a human finger to be between the two. So I took an insulated wire, unscrewed the metal screw slightly, wrapped it around the screw and tightened it again. Then I took the other end and connected it the GND port on the D1 Mini board, touched it to the YubiKey, and it worked!</p>

<p>Now the driver board for the stepper motor already connects to the 5V and GND on the D1 Mini, so I thought I might have to strip the GND wire and run it to both the driver board and the screw, but on a whim I decided to just wedge the end of the wire from the metal screw between the stepper motor metal body (figuring the metal body case was grounded) and the plastic housing. This also worked!</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/ground.jpg" alt="grounding"></p>

<p>Once I confirmed that the finger would trigger the YubiKey, I needed a way to mount the YubiKey close to the finger, so I used my digital calipers to measure the size of the USB-C extension cable and designed a holder in Fusion 360.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/holder.png" alt="holder"></p>

<p>The USB-C extension cable would go into the hole on the left and the motor would mount on the right.</p>

<p>At this point, we have to wire the stepper motor driver board to the D1 Mini. This can be done by soldering some headers onto the D1 Mini and then connecting some Dupont jumper wires between them.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/pins.jpg" alt="pins"></p>

</table>

<p>Once we put the stepper motor into the housing and screw everything together, it should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/yubikey/setup.jpg" alt="setup"></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The software is much more straightforward. The D1 Mini can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. First, we go into Preferences and add <code>https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</code> under <em>Additional Board Manager URLs</em>. Then when you go into the <em>Boards Managers</em>, you can install the <code>esp8266</code> package which includes the board <strong>LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 &amp; mini</strong>, which should be selected under <em>Tools</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I’ll run a sketch for blinking the LED just to verify that it’s working:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define LED 2 //Define blinking LED pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // Initialize the LED pin as an output
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // Turn the LED on (Note that LOW is the voltage level)
  delay(1000); // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
  delay(1000); // Wait for two seconds
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I found this <a href="https://robojax.com/learn/arduino/?vid=robojax_ESP8266_28BYJ-48_Stepper_ESP8STP-1">sketch</a> that shows how to control the 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor using WiFi.</p>

<p>Here are the parts that have to do with the motor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int Pin1 = D1; //IN1 is connected 
int Pin2 = D2; //IN2 is connected   
int Pin3 = D3; //IN3 is connected 
int Pin4 = D4; //IN4 is connected 
 
int pole1[] ={0,0,0,0, 0,1,1,1, 0}; //pole1, 8 step values
int pole2[] ={0,0,0,1, 1,1,0,0, 0}; //pole2, 8 step values
int pole3[] ={0,1,1,1, 0,0,0,0, 0}; //pole3, 8 step values
int pole4[] ={1,1,0,0, 0,0,0,1, 0}; //pole4, 8 step values

int poleStep = 0; 
int dirStatus = 3; // stores direction status 3= stop (do not change)
String argId[] ={"ccw", "cw"};

...

void loop(void) {
    server.handleClient();
    MDNS.update();

    if (dirStatus == 1) {
        poleStep++;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else if (dirStatus == 2) {
        poleStep--;
        driveStepper(poleStep);
    } else {
        driveStepper(8);
    }
    
    if (poleStep&gt;7) { 
        poleStep=0; 
    }

    if (poleStep&lt;0) {

            An FAQ follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why would someone pick C++ over Rust today?
          </p>
          <p>
            C++ templates are incredibly powerful, and with the introduction of compile-time expressions, vast portions of modern C++ programs are just compile-time tables. Examples like this make Rust look very tiny:
          </p>
          <pre><code>template &lt;size_t i, typename... Ts, typename CurTy&gt;
void recurseFillChildren(CurTy &amp;E)
{
  using PackTy = std::variant&lt;Ts...&gt;;
  using TyL = std::variant_alternative_t&lt;i - 1, PackTy&gt;;
  static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;CurTy, TyL&gt;);
  using TyR = std::variant_alternative_t&lt;i, PackTy&gt;;

  for (i32 j = 0; j &lt; E.NChildren; ++j)
  {
    E.Children.push_back(miniParser&lt;TyR&gt;());
    if constexpr (i + 1 &lt; sizeof...(Ts))
      recurseFillChildren&lt;i + 1, Ts...&gt;(E.Children.back());
  }
};</code></pre>
          <p>
            Is there anything that Rust can do that C++ can't?
          </p>
          <p>
            Rust didn't restrict what macros can do as much as C++ did. As a result, it's possible to do more with them. The particular example of the Pest parser is especially enlightening:
          </p>
          <pre><code>#[derive(Parser)]
#[grammar = "grammar.pest"]</code></pre>
          <p>
            Essentially, "grammar.pest" is processed at compile-time, and you can use definitions parsed from it in your code. However, there are trade-offs; Rust's macros are very slow, and your compile-times blow up if you have recursive macros. <mark>std::embed</mark> in C++23 will probably do it right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is Haskell classified as a dying language?
          </p>
          <p>
            Haskell is pleasant to get started with, and write relatively simple programs in. In the 2010-2015 period, there was a lot of intellectual discourse and PL research around it. The high-brow crowd was obssessed with transactional memory, parser combinators, and lenses. Online resources were exploding: LYAH and CatProg enjoyed their bouts of popularity. Several people and companies invested in Haskell heavily in that period. The language is easy to get started with, and has a pleasant development experience for relatively simple programs. The problems started when codebases started growing in size and complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            You either need to be able to interactively debug your program or prove that it is correct: in Haskell, you can't do either; the best you can do is to write some QuickCheck tests. Then there's Liquid Haskell that allows you to pepper your Haskell code with invariants that it will check using Z3. Unfortunately, it is very limited in what it can do: good luck checking your monadic combinator library with LH. Moreover, there are no tools to help you debug the most notorious kind of bug seen in a complicated codebase: memory blowups caused by laziness. It suffices to say that tooling is weak. In Atom, the Haskell addon was terrible, and even today, in VSCode, the Haskell extension is among the most buggy language plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/a1f34d37b47826e86343e368a5c00f1a4b1f2bce/compiler/GHC/Driver/Session.hs#L3729-3876">over 120</a> language extensions, which can be turned on/off in each <mark>.hs</mark> file. The issue is that different extensions interact in subtle ways to produce bugs, and it's very difficult to tell if a new language extension will play well with the others (it often doesn't, until all the bugs are squashed, which can take a few years). The best case scenario plays out like this: GHC rejects your program, and suggests that you turn on some other language extensions; you turn them on, and you're left with a cryptic error message coming from a language extension you're not as familiar with; you spend the next N hours reading whatever little information is available about the more recent language extension, and decide to throw in the towel. The worst case plays out as follows: the typechecker hangs or crashes, and you're on the issue tracker searching for the issue; if you're lucky, you'll find a bug filed using 50~60% of the language extensions you used in your program, and you're not sure if it's the same issue; you file a new issue. In either case, your work has been halted.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is almost zero documentation on language extensions. Hell, you can't even find the list of available language extensions with some description on any wiki. Looking at the big picture: first, this is a poor way to do software development; as the number of language extensions increase, your testing burden increases exponentially. Second, the problem of having a good type system is already solved by a simple dependent type theory; you study the core, and every new feature is just a small delta that fits in nicely with the overall model. As opposed to having to read detailed papers on each new language extension. And yes, there's a good chance that very few people will be able to understand your code if you're using some esoteric extensions. In summary, language extensions are complicated hacks to compensate for the poverty of Haskell's type system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, you'll be familar with ~20 language extensions, and use various combinations of them over and over again, so the problem might not seem as acute as a regular Haskell programmer. However, PL research has shifted away from Haskell for the most part, and the little that happens tends to be <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/03/ho-haskell-5c8bb4918a4de.pdf">unnecessarily complex nonsense</a> that never sees the light of day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a sample of some simple Haskell code pieced together. I've intentionally left out examples using <mark>LinearTypes</mark>, because it's unfair to find faults with such a recent language feature.
          </p>
          <ol type="none" start="1">
            <li>
              What does the code mean? What is the intent?
            </li>
            <li>
              Can you specifically tell how each language extension was useful in the snippet?
            </li>
            <li>
              Guess what the code will do on GHC 8.10.1. What will an older version of GHC do?
            </li>
            <li>
              How many more language features are missing?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeInType #-}

import GHC.Exts

type family Dim v

type family v `OfDim` (n :: Dim v) = r | r -&gt; n

(!*^) :: Dim m `OfDim` j -&gt; Dim m `OfDim` i
(!*^) = undefined</code></pre>
          <p>
            Doesn't Go feature a solid compiler/runtime?
          </p>
          <p>
            It does, but the author didn't feel that it was worthy of an asterisk, because the compiler is working with a really dumb language. Nevertheless, the GC and scheduler are praise-worthy, as is the overall experience with ultra-low compile-times.

The order finds that BMW of North America LLC (BMW NA) maintained a reserve of unreported retail vehicle sales — referred to internally as the “bank” — that it used to meet internal monthly sales targets without regard to when the underlying sales occurred. The order also finds that BMW NA paid dealers to inaccurately designate vehicles as demonstrators or loaners so that BMW would count them as having been sold to customers when they had not been. Additionally, the order finds that BMW NA improperly adjusted its retail sales reporting calendar in 2015 and 2017 to meet internal sales targets or bank excess retail sales for future use. As a result, according to the order, the information that BMW provided to investors in the bond offerings by BMW’s U.S. financing subsidiary, BMW US Capital LLC, and to credit rating agencies contained material misstatements and omissions regarding BMW’s U.S. retail vehicle sales.</p><cite><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-223</a></cite></blockquote><p>After having spent 43 years in the car business (many of which with BMW North America), I can unequivocally say these practices are routine and commonplace within car dealerships. Fraudulent behavior like this is not limited to BMW. Every manufacturer I have ever worked for encourages this.</p><p>When I worked for Penske Automotive Group we were explicitly instructed not to fudge any numbers. If our BMW rep asked us to “pad the numbers” one month, we didn’t. Penske didn’t want to participate in that type of activity. They were the exception to the rule.</p><p>As a dealer you have very little choice but to “play the game.” As I’ve talked about in other videos and guides here on the blog, car dealers don’t make much of anything when they sell vehicles. Instead, <a href="https://yourautoadvocate.com/guides/how-do-car-dealerships-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they make their money from factory incentives and from selling finance and insurance products</a>.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTYnhidJMe8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>With that in mind, it’s clear why dealers “play the game.” If you have a $250,000 incentive that is based on the number of cars you sell in any given month, and the person writing you that check (BMW) is encouraging you to “fake” sales so that you can actually attain the bonus, what would you do? The answer is simple.</p><p>Car manufacturers are happy to pay out giant monthly bonuses to subsidize their dealers, but only if they hit certain sales volume thresholds. This is because manufacturers are then able to report better than expected sales volumes to their investors.</p><p>How many fraudulently reported vehicles are “sold” in any given month? In any given month we would designate 15 Mini Coopers as “sold,” even though they hadn’t been. In that same month we may have actually sold 35 or 40 vehicles. Each month, upwards of 20% of our “sales” were fake.</p><p>It’s surprising to think that BMW was only fined $18M. Considering a nontrivial amount of their sold inventory is not actually sold, you would think the fine should be $180M instead of $18M.</p><p>Fiat Chrysler paid $40M in fines a few years ago for similar practices. Regardless of who it is, it’s clear that the fines aren’t enough to stop the fraudulent behavior.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Boa is an experimental Javascript lexer, parser and compiler written in Rust. It has support for some of the language, can be embedded in Rust projects fairly easily and also used from the command line.
Boa also exists to serve as a Rust implementation of the EcmaScript specification, there will be areas where we can utilise Rust and its fantastic ecosystem to make a fast, concurrent and safe engine.</p>

<p>We have a long way to go, however v0.10 has been the biggest release to date, with 138 issues closed!</p>

<p>We have some highlights, but if you prefer to read the full changelog, you can do that <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a></p>

<h2 id="test262">Test262</h2>

<p>One question we’ve been asked for a long time is “how conformant are you to the spec?”. It’s been tough to answer as we’ve been unable to run against the official test suite.</p>

<p>Test262 is the official ECMAScript Test Suite and exists to provide conformance tests for the latest drafts of the Ecma specification. It is used for all engines, you can even run it in your <a href="https://bakkot.github.io/test262-web-runner/">browser</a>.<br>
Thanks to @Razican in v0.10 we now have a test harness that allows us to run it against Boa at any time.</p>

<p>This is a new crate inside the Boa repository that can parse through all of the tests (roughly 40,000 of them) in under 10 minutes and tell us how conformant we are.</p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-10-02/test262-screenshot.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Today Boa has <span>18</span>% conformity to the specification. We’ll be keeping an eye on this number over the releases. We expect to achieve around 30% by 0.11 due to some of the fixes we’re adding which should pass a few thousand tests.</p>

<p>These are run via Github Actions against PRs and for our master branch so that we can keep track of where we are and if there are regressions.</p>

<h2 id="built-ins">Built-ins</h2>

<p>We’ve added support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"><code>Map</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol">well-known symbols</a>. Supporting Well-known symbols unblocks a lot of work around adding <code>@@iterators</code> to some of our global objects which is coming up in the next release.<br>
Both <code>Math</code> and <code>Number</code> have had their remaining methods implemented.</p>

<h2 id="lexer">Lexer</h2>

<p>The lexer has been rebuilt from scratch. Just like the old parser it was a single file before looping through and becoming unmaintainable. Today we’ve reorganised it into separate modules which know how to lex certain areas. The new lexer <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/294">now supports goal symbols</a> and can now tokenize with the correct context at any time.</p>

<h3 id="goal-symbols">Goal Symbols</h3>

<p>Our issue with goal symbols is explained by the V8 team:
<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3#lexical-grammar">https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-3#lexical-grammar</a></p>

<p>Previously we weren’t distinguishing between the contexts where some input elements are permitted and some are not, so lexing <code>/</code> would yeild a <code>division</code> symbols when it should be a <code>RegularExpressionLiteral</code> for example. This change unblocked us being able to run Test262.</p>

<p>Performance wise it is much faster for larger files. The lexer is far more efficient at streaming tokens to the parser than previously so in some scenarios we have big gains.</p>

<p><em>You can see all the benchmarks <a href="https://boa-dev.github.io/boa/dev/bench/">here</a></em></p>

<h2 id="repl-syntax-highlighting">Repl syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>Syntax highlighting was added to the repl this release thanks to @HalidOdat<br>
Our repl is made possible due to the great work of <a href="https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline">RustyLine</a></p>

<p><img src="https://boa-dev.github.io/images/2020-10-02/syntaxHighlighting.gif" alt="image"></p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>There are plenty of fixes and performance changes still needed, we also hope to experiment with producing Bytecode from our AST in future. Test262 coverage will almost certainly increase, and we are polishing the public API for easier use when embedding into other Rust projects.</p>

<p>Thanks to all those who contributed to 0.10, you can see the names in the full changelog linked above.</p>

<p>You can checkout Boa via <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/boa">Github</a> or on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Boa">crates.io</a></p>

<p>Earlier this year, DeisLabs released Krustlet, a project to implement Kubelet
in Rust. <sup id="fnref:Fisher"><a href="#fn:Fisher">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:Squillace"><a href="#fn:Squillace">2</a></sup> Kubelet is the component of Kubernetes that
runs on each node which is assigned Pods by the control plane and runs them on
its node. Krustlet defines a flexible API in the <code>kubelet</code> crate, which allows
developers to build Kubelets to run new types of workloads. The project
includes two such examples, which can run Web Assembly workloads on WASI or
waSCC runtimes. <sup id="fnref:wasmtime"><a href="#fn:wasmtime">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:waSCC"><a href="#fn:waSCC">4</a></sup> Beyond this, I have been working to
develop a Rust Kubelet for traditional Linux containers using the Container
Runtime Interface (CRI). <sup id="fnref:krustlet-cri"><a href="#fn:krustlet-cri">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:CRI"><a href="#fn:CRI">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Over the last few releases, Krustlet has focused on expanding the functionality
of these Web Assembly Kubelets, such as adding support for init containers,
fixing small bugs, and log streaming. This, in turn, has built quite a bit of
interest in alternative workloads and node architectures on Kubernetes, as well
as demonstrated the many strengths of Rust for development of these types of
applications.</p>

<p>For the <code>v0.5.0</code> release, we turned our attention to the internal architecture
of Krustlet, in particular how Pods move through their lifecycle, how
developers write this logic, and how updates to the Kubernetes control plane
are handled. <sup id="fnref:Pod-Lifecycle"><a href="#fn:Pod-Lifecycle">7</a></sup> We settled upon a state machine implementation
which should result in fewer bugs and greater fault tolerance. This refactoring
resulted in substantial changes for consumers of our API; however we believe
this will result in code that is much easier to reason about and maintain. For
an excellent summary of these changes, and description of how you can migrate
code that depends on the <code>kubelet</code> crate, please see Taylor Thomas’ excellent
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Release Notes</a>.
In this post I will share a deep dive into our new architecture and the
development journey which led to it.</p>

<h2 id="the-trailhead">The Trailhead</h2>

<p>Before <code>v0.5.0</code>, developers wishing to implement a Kubelet using Krustlet
primarily needed to implement the <code>Provider</code> trait, which allowed them to write
methods for handling events like <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, and <code>logs</code> for Pods scheduled
to that node. This offered a lot of flexibility, but was a very low-level API.
We identified a number of issues with this architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>The entire lifecycle of a Pod was defined in 1 or 2 monolithic methods of the
<code>Provider</code> trait. This resulted in messy code and a very poor understanding
of error handling in the many phases of a Pod’s lifecycle.</li>
<li>Pod and Container status patches to the Kubernetes control plane were
scattered throughout the codebase, both in the <code>kubelet</code> crate and the
<code>Provider</code> implementations. This made it very difficult to reason about what
was actually reported back to the user and when, and involved lot of repeated
code.</li>
<li>Unlike the Go Kubelet, if Krustlet encountered an error it would report the
error back to Kubernetes and then (most of the time) end execution of the
Pod. There was no built-in notion of the reconciliation loop that one expects
from Kubernetes.</li>
<li>We recognized that a lot of these issues were left to each developer to
solve, but were things that any Kubelet would need to handle. We wanted to
move this kind of logic into the <code>kubelet</code> crate, so that each provider did
not have to reinvent things.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<p>At its core, Kubernetes relies on declarative (mostly immutable) manifests, and
controllers which run reconciliation loops to drive cluster state to match this
configuration. Kubelet is no exception to this, with its focus being
indivisible units of work, or Pods. Kubelet simply monitors for changes to Pods
that have been assigned to it by <code>kube-scheduler</code>, and runs a loop to attempt
to run this work on its node. In fact, I would describe Kubelet as no different
from any other Kubernetes controller, except that it has the additional
first-class capability for streaming logs and exec sessions. However these
capabilities, as they are implemented in Krustlet, are orthogonal to this
discussion.</p>

<p>Our goal with this rewrite was to ensure that Krustlet would mirror the official
Kubelet’s behavior as closely as possible. We found that many details about
this behavior are undocumented, and spent considerable time running the
application to infer its behavior and inspecting the Go source code. Our
understanding is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Kubelet watches for Events on Pods that have been scheduled to it by
<code>kube-scheduler</code>.</li>
<li>When a Pod is added, the Kubelet enters a control loop to attempt to run the
Pod which only exits when the Pod is <code>Completed</code> (all containers
exit successfully) or <code>Terminated</code> (Pod is marked for deletion via the
control plane and execution is interrupted).</li>
<li>Within the control loop, there are various steps such as <code>Image Pull</code>,
<code>Starting</code>, etc., as well as back-off steps which wait some time before
retrying the Pod. At each of these steps, the Kubelet updates the control
plane.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recognized this pretty quickly as a finite-state machine design pattern,
which consists of infallible state handlers and valid state transitions. This
allows us to address the issues mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Break up the <code>Provider</code> trait methods for running the Pod into short,
single-focus state handler methods.</li>
<li>Consolidate status patch code to where a Pod enters a given state.</li>
<li>Include error and back-off states in the state graph, and only stop
attempting to execute a Pod on <code>Terminated</code> or <code>Complete</code>.</li>
<li>Move as much of this logic into <code>kubelet</code> as possible so that providers need
only focus on implementing the state handlers.
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>With this architecture it becomes very easy to understand the behavior of the
application, and strengthens our confidence that the application will not enter
undefined behavior. In addition, we felt that Rust would allow us to achieve
our goals while presenting an elegant API to developers, and with full
compile-time enforcement of our state machine rules.</p>

<h2 id="our-animal-guide">Our Animal Guide</h2>

<p>When first discussing the requirements of our state machine, and the daunting
task of integrating it with the existing Krustlet codebase, we recalled an
excellent blog post,
<a href="https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/">Pretty State Machine Patterns in Rust</a>,
by Ana Hobden (hoverbear), which I think has inspired a lot of Rust developers.
The post explores patterns in Rust for implementing state machines which
satisfy a number of constraints and leverage Rust’s type system. I encourage
you to read the original post, but for the sake of this discussion I will
paraphrase the final design pattern here:</p>

<pre><code>struct StateMachine&lt;S&gt; {
    state: S,
}

struct StateA;

impl StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt; {
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateA
        }
    }
}

struct StateB;

impl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {
    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateA&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt; {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateB 
        }
    }
}

struct StateC;

impl From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt; for StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {
    fn from(val: StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;) -&gt; StateMachine&lt;StateC&gt; {
        StateMachine {
            state: StateC 
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let in_state_a = StateMachine::new();

    // Does not compile because `StateC` is not `From&lt;StateMachine&lt;StateB&gt;&gt;`.
    // let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    let in_state_b = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    // Does not compile because `in_state_a` was moved in the line above.
    // let in_state_b_again = StateMachine::&lt;StateB&gt;::from(in_state_a);

    let in_state_c = StateMachine::&lt;StateC&gt;::from(in_state_b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ana introduces a number of requirements for a good state machine
implementation, and achieves them with concise and easily interpretable code.
In particular, these requirements (some based on the definition of a state
machine, and some on ergonomics) were a high priority for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>One state at a time.</li>
<li>Capability for shared state.</li>
<li>Only explicitly defined transitions should be permitted.</li>
<li>Any error messages should be easy to understand.</li>
<li>As many errors as possible should be identified at <strong>compile-time</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next section I will discuss some additional requirements that we
introduced and how these impacted the solution. In particular, we relaxed some
of Ana’s goals in exchange for greater flexibility, while satisfying those
listed above.</p>

<h2 id="tribulation">Tribulation</h2>

<p>We were off to a great start, but it was time to consider how we want
downstream developers to interact with our new state machine API. In
particular, while the Kubelets we are familiar with all follow roughly the same
Pod lifecycle, we wanted developers to be able to implement arbitrary state
machines for their Kubelet. For example, some workloads or architectures may
need to have additional provisioning states for infrastructure or data, or
to introduce post-run states for proper garbage collection of resources.
Additionally, it felt like an anti-pattern to have a parent method (<code>main</code> in
the example above) which defines the logic for progressing through the states,
as this felt like having two sources of truth and was not something we could
implement on behalf of our downstream developers for arbitrary state machines.
Ana had discussed how to hold the state machine in a parent structure using an
<code>enum</code>, but it felt clunky to introduce large match statements which could
introduce runtime errors.</p>

<p>We knew that to allow arbitrary state machines we would need a <code>State</code> trait to
mark types as valid states. We felt that it would be possible for this trait to
have a <code>next()</code> method which runs the state and then returns the next <code>State</code>
to transition to, and we wanted our code to be able to simply call <code>next()</code>
repeatedly to drive the machine to completion. This pattern, we soon found,
introduced a number of challenges.</p>

<pre><code>/// Rough pseudocode of our plan.

trait State {
    /// Do work for this state and return next state.
    async fn next(self) -&gt; impl State;
}

fn drive_state_machine(mut state: impl State) {
    loop {
        state = state.next().await;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-does-next-return">What does <code>next()</code> return?</h3>

<p>Within our loop, we are repeatedly overwriting a local variable with
<em>different</em> types that all implement <code>State</code>. …</p></div></div>

<p><em>In case you are coming from Hacker News and are confused about some comments, be aware that I updated the essay to deal with some criticism</em>.</p>



<p>The title is not hyperbole. I do think that privacy is the most important concept of our time. Let me tell you why:</p>



<ul><li><strong>internet is not a virtual world anymore</strong>, it is a dimension that permeates our lives; we work, socialize and get informed through the internet</li><li><strong>our society is more diverse</strong>; we have some things in common with our neighbors and some with separate communities</li><li><strong>privacy is integral to separate the</strong> <strong>different parts of our lives</strong>; once the separation could be just physical and accidental (i.e., you live here and work there), now it must be built intentionally because there are no natural barriers in information spreading</li></ul>



<p>In short, internet has made sharing information easier and complexity has made information more dangerous. We need to evolve our understanding of rules and norms to deal with this new situation. </p>



<p>I have always believed in the importance of privacy, but I felt that common definitions (e.g., <em>the right to be left alone</em>) were lacking. In fact, I think that the whole conceptualization of privacy as simply a right of an individual and regarding private information as partial and limiting.</p>



<p>Think about this: the government can send policemen to surveil you and everybody they deem interesting. However, it can do this only for few people. <strong>This limitation is due to physical constraints, not legal ones</strong>. There is a limited number of policemen and you would notice if there was a police car in front of each house of the neighborhood. <strong>This is not true for internet communications: the government can spy everyone at once and you would never notice</strong>. As many whistleblowers have revealed, this is what the NSA has actually done.</p>



<p>So, the changes in society affect privacy directly but may also affect all our rights indirectly. Privacy is the fundamental principle that must respond to these changes.</p>



<p>You might say that then, maybe, I am not really thinking about privacy, but rather something else. That might be true, so let’s not talk about privacy, instead let’s talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco">Ur-Privacy</a>, the principles of any possible concept of privacy. Take this essay as the opinion of a random guy that cares about the issue.</p>



<div><h2>What is Ur-Privacy</h2><p><em>A few principles for privacy</em></p></div>







<p><strong>Privacy is not just something we need to separate our private live from our public live. It is necessary to separate our private live, the communities we belong to and the public sphere from each other.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about boundaries.</strong> It is not about hiding something but allowing to create a space with rules decided by its members. I like to compare it to borders. Some people say that borders are a restriction, something that limit freedom of movement and we do not need in the contemporary world. As if they were arbitrary obstacles put there by petty people. It almost makes sense if you do not think about them, after all you are actually stopped at a border.</p>



<p>However, that is not true, that is not why they exist. Borders delimit the area that a certain state control, an area where a specific set of rules and laws applies. There was a time before borders, in fact most of human history did not have clear borders. It was not a time of freedom, but anarchy, where bands of barbarians could roam into your home and pillage everything.</p>



<p>In this context is also important to remember that before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> modern European states were plagued by continual wars. The short version is that this was due to the combination of two facts:</p>



<ul><li>modernity begets differences, different kings choose different religions<sup><a id="link_1" href="#note_1" data-type="internal" data-id="#note_1">1</a></sup> and separated societies</li><li>however, the legitimacy of kings was still based on shared medieval ideals, like the concept of divine rule</li></ul>



<p>In short, the issue was not that <strong>leaders wanted to make war all the time, they needed to do so</strong> because the legitimacy of their power depended, at least on some level, to what the rest of the European world was doing. If you claim to be a divine king there better be agreement on what the divine is, otherwise a guy that picks a different religion can also pick a different king. And, according to some, he could be a legitimate king. To change the situation this peace treaty established the principle that the internal affairs of a state are the exclusive interest of said state.</p>



<p>The connection with privacy is this: without clear rules on what is private and what is public, nobody knows which stuff belongs to whom. This means chaos and often that all belong to the strongest. Somebody might say that what you do in private, it is not private at all but political. It concerns the society at large. Therefore, it must be regulated according to their rules.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy does not imply hiding the truth.</strong> <strong>Meaning depends on context, therefore everything should be considered within its context.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about control</strong>. Without privacy we cannot decide for ourselves how to live our lives. If there is no privacy, all become public. Whoever has more power and an interest can affect your life according to their own rules. Then, I have to care about what other people think, otherwise they will control how I can behave. As before the peace of Westphalia, the issue is not that other people are bad, <em>they have to do it</em>. When everything is subject to public scrutiny, you either control the rules and judge others or you are judged and controlled by others.</p>



<p>Think about this way: we say a lot of things in our private lives that are not meant to be taken literally. In private we say something and then we add: <em>you know what I mean</em>. And that is actually true. We can do that because the people we talk to in private know us; they understand the context in which our words must be understood. And even more importantly: they care about us; they do not want to intentionally misunderstand us.</p>



<p>When I was a child I would sometimes say and think that I wanted to kill my brother. I did not mean it literally and everybody knew it. If I said the same thing now, in public, to somebody that does not know me, the phrase would be different. It would be a threat.</p>



<p>Why is that? They are the exact same words. You know why, of course. I am different and the context is different. The real meaning of something, whether an action or a word, is not absolute, in most cases it is relative. When we speak in public, we share a different context, therefore our words have a different meaning. </p>



<p>So even if I say something as a hyperbole, or something that can be construed as an implicit threat (e.g., <em>they must be stopped at all costs</em>!), they might protest. You might say that they are overreacting, that it was just a joke, but how can they be sure of it? <strong>They do not know me.</strong> It is true that acts of violence are prepared by violent words. Even if you are unsure if something is really violent, you have to take a stand. You have to make clear that any attack against you is not permissible. Otherwise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings">somebody, maybe a crazy guy, might think that it is permissible and the right course of action</a>. Somebody might feel legitimated to take your land and kingdom.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy is not just needed to protect us from the government or exceptional situations. It is about understanding the rules that applies to every aspect of our life so that they can be fair for everybody.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Privacy is about everyday life</strong>. The issue is not simply that something we say can be considered a threat. When you are communicating with someone you need to be able to understand them. Communication requires a shared understanding at some level.</p>



<p>The easiest example to understand this are work discussions. When we talk with people that work in our field, we can communicate more easily the impact of a choice. This goes beyond the ability to use technical terminology: we know which are the main things to care about. The same discussion with our bosses would be different. Even making them understand the basic strengths and weaknesses is more challenging.</p>



<p>Now imagine being forced to communicate everything you do in the most general terms, to people that do not care about you, because <strong>everybody can see you</strong>. So, they can use any piece of information for their own needs. This could mean a policeman investigating you. It could also mean a company making you pay more for a pair sneakers, because they know how much disposable income you have and that you really love sneakers.</p>



<p>We need privacy to be aware of what is happening to us. It is too much to demand we know how other people interpret what we say. However, it is not excessive to ask that we can control what is shared about us.</p>



<div><h2>Privacy Affects Everything</h2><p><em>Defending privacy would require all-around changes</em></p></div>







<p><strong>Privacy is the most important concept of our time, because it influences everything else. Without privacy we do not know what rules applies. Our lives will be judged according to the rules of somebody else</strong> <strong>in ways we cannot even imagine.</strong></p>



<p>We cannot discuss all of the possible implications of privacy on other rights, so let’s see just the example of <em>freedom of speech</em>. Of course, sometimes you can also be judged for who you are: your religion or lack thereof, political opinion or sexual orientation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Give me six lines written by the most honest man, and there I will find something to hang him.</p><cite>Cardinal Richelieu</cite></blockquote>



<p>People lost jobs and had their lives ruined, because the mob judged something they said in private in a different way from what they expected. And they paid a price. You might say: that was fair. We might judge ourselves by our intentions, but others by their actions, which are real and objective.</p>







<p>I, for once, disagree with XKCD and this view. There are a couple of different issues here:</p>



<ul><li>how we should react to speech we disagree with</li><li>what was meant to be shared among friends was taken out of context and made public</li></ul>



<p>This complicates the …</p></div></div></article></div>

<p>Two years ago I <a href="https://flatkill.org/">wrote</a> about then heavily-pushed Flatpak, self-proclaimed "Future of Apps on Linux". The article criticized the following three major flows in Flatpak:</p><ul>
<li>Most of the apps have full access to the host system but users are misled to believe the apps are sandboxed
</li><li>The flatpak runtimes and apps do not get security updates
</li><li>Flatpak breaks many aspects of desktop integration
</li></ul>

<!-- <p>A lot has changed in the 2 years (the company behind Flatpak is now just another IBM's brand for one thing) so let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.</p> -->
<p>So let's see how Flatpak developers addressed these fundamental issues.</p>

<h2>The sandbox is STILL a lie</h2>

<p>Almost all popular apps on Flathub still come with <span>filesystem=host</span> or <span>filesystem=home</span> permissions, in other words, <b>write access to the user home directory</b> (and more) so all it takes to escape the sandbox is trivial <span>echo download_and_execute_evil &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</span>. That's it.</p>


<p>The most popular applications on Flathub still suffer from this - Gimp, VSCodium, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Audacity, VLC are still not sandboxed.</p>

<p>And, indeed, users are still mislead by the reassuring blue "sandboxed" icon. Two years is not enough to add a warning that an application is <b>not</b> sandboxed if it comes with dangerous permissions (like full access to your home directory)? Seriously?</p>

<img src="https://www.flatkill.org/2020/sandboxlie.png" alt="sandboxlie">

<h2>Flatpak apps and runtimes STILL contain long known security holes</h2>
<p>It took me about 20 minutes to find the first vulnerability in a Flathub application with full host access and I didn't even bother to use a vulnerability scanner.</p>

A perfect example is <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17498">CVE-2019-17498</a> with public exploit <a href="https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/libssh2/out_of_bounds_read_disconnect_CVE-2019-17498">available</a> for some 8 months. The first app on Flathub I find to use libssh2 library is Gitg and, indeed, it does ship with unpatched libssh2.

<p>But is it just this one application? Let's look at the <b>official runtimes</b> at the heart of Flatpak (org.freedesktop.Platform and org.gnome.Platform <b>3.36</b> - as of time of writing used by most of the applications on Flathub). The first unpatched vulnerable dependency I found in the offical runtime is ffmpeg in version 4.2.1 with no security patches backported, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-12284">CVE-2020-12284</a>.</p><p>Recently I stumbled upon an article from 2011 which started what is today known as flatpak, <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2">in the words of the project founder:</a></p>

<p><a href="https://people.gnome.org/~alexl/glick2"><b><i>"Another problem is with security (or bugfix) updates in bundled libraries. With bundled libraries its much harder to upgrade a single library, as you need to find and upgrade each app that uses it. Better tooling and upgrader support can lessen the impact of this, but not completely eliminate it."</i></b></a></p>

<p>After reading that it comes as no surprise flatpak still suffers from the same security issues as 2 years ago because flatpak developers knew about these problems from the beginning.</p>

<h2>Local root exploits are NOT considered a minor issue anymore!</h2>
<p>Great! Two years ago I wrote about a trivial local root exploit using flatpak to install suid binaries (<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9780/">CVE-2017-9780</a>) and how it was downplayed by Flatpak developers as a minor security issue <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/0.8.7">here</a>. I am happy to see at least the attitude to local root exploits has changed and today <a href="https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/security/advisories/GHSA-j2qp-rvxj-43vj">local root exploits</a> are considered high severity.

</p><h2>Desktop integration</h2>
<p>System and user fonts are now available to flatpak applications and basic font rendering settings are respected as well, however do not expect your changes in /etc/fonts, typically setting a proper fallback font for CJK characters, to work with flatpak.  KDE applications in flatpak are still ignoring themes, fonts and icon settings (tested with Qt5ct). Applications installed from the distribution sources do not have these problems, of course. <a href="https://www.flatkill.org/2020/desktopbrokenation.mp4">A quick screen capture to demonstrate</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly, fcitx, <i>the</i> IME for Chinese is still broken - it has been 2 years. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031">issue</a> I linked 2 years ago - especially of interest is <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031#issuecomment-655134889">the following comment</a> directly from fcitx developer:

</p><p><i>"Because fcitx im module in flatpak is from 4.2.97 and using a different dbus object path. <b>It need to be the same version of fcitx on your host</b>."</i></p>

So I need to run multiple fcitx daemons on my desktop and switch between them as I switch flatpak apps depending on which fcitx libraries are bundled with that app or maybe in the future of linux apps it's not possible to type chinese anymore and it's fine?

<p>While the "bundle everything" approach has proven very useful on servers it clearly does not work for desktop applications, let's keep linking system libraries in desktop applications (and use the bundled libraries as a fallback only) to avoid introducing all these problems to Linux desktop.</p>

When asked to analyze the experiences of black people in the United Kingdom, we now talk with an American accent.</p><p>Take a look, for instance, at a meme that has been circulating among some of my white friends on Facebook and Instagram:</p><blockquote><p>I have privilege as a White person because I can do all of these things without thinking twice about it … I can go jogging (#AmaudArbery). I can relax in the comfort of my own home (#BothemSean and #AtatianaJefferson). I can ask for help after being in a car crash (#Jonathan Ferrell and #RenishaMcBride). I can have a cellphone (#StephonClark). I can leave a party to get to safety (#JordanEdwards). I can play loud music (#JordanDavis). I can sell CDs (#AltonSterling). I can sleep (#AiyanaJones). I can walk from the corner store (#MikeBrown).</p></blockquote><p>The post goes on and on, like an interminable spoken-word poem. All the individuals listed are American, but most of the people who have shared this on my timeline are British. In trying to express their solidarity with black Britons, they are affirming a supposedly transcendental truth: to be black is to live in perpetual terror of being murdered by the state. </p><p>But Britain is not America. And importing American race discourse into the United Kingdom not only prevents us from recognizing the specific ways in which racial injustice manifests in this country—it cloaks the reality of black British lives behind an abstraction that flattens our humanity. </p><p>Britain has a long and painful history of anti-black racism. In the twentieth century alone, the growing black presence led to a long catalogue of abuses: the 1919 race riots in Liverpool, Cardiff and London; the 1958 race riots in Nottingham and Notting Hill; the 1969 police murder of David Oluwale, a Nigerian immigrant who was tortured, pissed on and finally drowned in a river in Leeds. I could list other examples. It is not hard to see why the horrific killing of George Floyd has evoked such strong feelings in this country as well.</p><p>But for all of the country’s flaws, Britain is not America. Trying to understand its racial dynamics through the lens of another country’s does more to obscure than to illuminate the situation that black Britons like myself actually face.</p><p>The average black American in the United States can trace his ancestry further back than the average white American. Most black Americans are descended from enslaved Africans. Their forebears suffered through the segregation and racial terror of the Jim Crow era. The majority of black people in the United Kingdom, by contrast, are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Though many of them have certainly had harrowing experiences with injustice or discrimination, they do not have the same history of racist disadvantage.</p><p>To understand the experience of black Britons, it is not only necessary to grasp how different their history is from that of black Americans: we need to understand the diversity captured by the label “black British.” For example, around two out of every three students with Congolese or Somali origins get free school meals, a standard indicator that their parents are poor. Among students with Nigerian or Ghanaian origins, only one in five do. It is also noteworthy that black Caribbean students are twice as likely to be excluded from school as black African students. </p><p>The discrepancy in educational attainment is just as stark. On average, 58% of black African students graduate from middle school at grade level (defined as achieving A* to C grades at GCSE)—about the same number as white students. But black Caribbean students are significantly less likely to do so—while those whose parents hail from Nigeria actually outperform their white peers by a considerable margin. </p><p>None of this is to disavow the label “black British.” But we need to invest it with the nuance consonant with its reality—and to cast doubt on the idea that every discrepancy in representation must be explained by structural injustice or white supremacy.</p><p>There has, for example, been a lot of concern about the underrepresentation of black Britons in professions like the arts and publishing. But why would you choose to go into theater or journalism—rather than law, medicine or finance—if you are a talented child of ambitious but not well off immigrants? </p><p>This is not a flippant question. While representation can be important, anybody who actually wants to improve the condition of black Britons should at least be a little curious about why they are overrepresented in some prestigious professions and underrepresented in others. In a country in which black people make up only three percent of the population, for example, six percent of junior doctors are black. Would the country—or the black community—really benefit if more black Britons chose to ditch medicine for the theater? The debate is worth having. But in the place of that debate, there have only been pious paeans to diversity.</p><p>The stereotype of the West African parent who wants their child to study law or medicine bears some relation to reality; but the widespread view of black people as perennial victims devoid of agency is a defamatory abstraction. The black person in Britain, like Ralph Ellison’s iconic protagonist, is “invisible because no one wants to see him.”</p><p>So much of the British reaction to the death of George Floyd has constituted a failure of nerve. Desperately seeking to assuage their feelings of guilt, to do <em>something</em>, many Britons have sacrificed their critical faculties to a narrative that does not actually help black people—a narrative that, by reducing us to passive abstractions, only makes us more invisible.</p><p>Racists assume that black people are all the same. Ironically, anti-racists sometimes do so too. But anybody who is truly committed to racial equality needs to recognize that this kind of simplification neither serves justice nor reflects the truth.</p><p><strong>Tomiwa Owolade is a writer who lives in London.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

(Map image by Daniel R. Strebe, licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0)</p><h2>1. The only projection that is important is Web Mercator</h2><p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator_projection">Web Mercator</a> is
probably the most popular projection that most people will run into, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection">Albers</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_cylindrical_equal-area_projection">Lambert</a>
equal-area projections are fairly common for when the projection needs to maintain
the area rather than the navigational direction (which is one of the main features
of the Mercator projection).</p><h2>2. All coordinates are latitude/longitude pairs</h2><p>In addition to latitude/longitude coordinates, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system">Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates</a>
are also fairly common. UTM splits the Earth into 60 zones, and then
further specifies northings and eastings in metres (as opposed to degrees, minutes and seconds).</p><p>The UTM notably omits the polar areas - which are covered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_polar_stereographic_coordinate_system">Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS)
coordinate system</a>
instead.</p><h2>3. Latitude always comes before longitude in a coordinate pair</h2><p>While it is common to see items in (latitude,longitude) order, some formats
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON">GeoJSON</a>) dictate that coordinates
follow (longitude,latitude) order instead. This matches the typical way coordinates
are specified in a Cartesian coordinate system: (x,y).</p><h2>4. A degree of latitude or longitude always represents the same distance</h2><p>In the Mercator projection, the Earth - which, in reality, is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Oblate_spheroids">oblate spheroid</a> -
is projected as a simple cylinder. This means that "parallel" longitude lines
meet at the poles, so the distance between degrees of longitude are much shorter
as they get closer to the poles than they are at the equator (~111 km).</p><p>The variance in latitude is not as large - but it still varies by about 1km going
from the equator to the poles.</p><h2>5. The shortest path between two points is a straight line</h2><p>The Earth isn't flat - as such, although your map may be projected to be flat,
the distance between two points needs to follow the curvature of
the Earth and can usually be approximated by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a>.</p><h2>6. Coordinates for a given landmark are always fixed</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift">Movements of the Earth's tectonic plates</a>
mean that the land masses are moving slowly with the passage of time.
For example, Australia has shifted about 1.8 metres from where it
was in 1994 (about 7 centimetres per year). This also means that <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/geodesy/datums-projections/gda2020">geocentric
datums</a>
have to be updated to account for these changes every once in a while.</p><h2>7. Given a pair of coordinates, you can plot it on a map</h2><p>In addition to coordinates, we also need to know the datum, which is
the coordinate system and its specific set of reference points on the Earth.
While most coordinates often follow the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84 datum</a>,
care should be taken to ensure that the map and the coordinates plotted
are using the same datum.</p><h2>8. There is one global ellipsoid to base coordinates on</h2><p>Most modern datums are based on the WGS84
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>
as the surveys are often completed using GPS as a reference, but notably
Russia and China still base their local datums on different reference ellipsoids.</p><p>As a result, conversions to and from datums based on different
ellipsoids may result in inaccuracies and deviations and may be of concern
if you have to deal with GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou data at the same time.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p><p><em>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, an audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they’ve come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 28, Transport Tycoon, or the tale of the great optimiser and his two greatest works.</em></p><p>We’ll get going in just a moment. </p><p>*pause for pre-roll ad/cross-promo slot*</p><p>***</p><p>You may have heard the expression that every overnight sensation is a decade in the making — a decade of hard work, toiling in obscurity…or <em>relative</em> obscurity, honing a talent, perfecting a craft, <em>optimising</em> a skill set and envisioning whatever it is that breaks through.</p><p>In reality the actual duration is rarely a decade — it’s five years or eight years or eighteen years, or however long it takes for the pieces to all fall into place: the talent, timing, and product. But the idea bears repeating: the greatest accolades, the greatest achievements, the greatest games are the product of hard work built atop years of invisible labour.</p><p>And such it was that Chris Sawyer, like John Romero, Carol Shaw, Gunpei Yokoi, and many others before and since — such it was that in 1994 Chris Sawyer suddenly shifted from a little-known (though well-respected) figure in the games industry, a programmer who converted Amiga games to the PC, to become an industry icon.</p><p>Nineteen-ninety-four was the year when his first original game was published, the year when big-name PC game publisher Microprose put his transportation-focused business simulation game Transport Tycoon, an incredible solo development effort, in a box and sold it in stores to widespread acclaim. </p><p><img alt="SCR1" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/scr1.jpg" width="866" height="362"><br><em>Transport Tycoon, the game that made Chris Sawyer into a games industry icon (</em><em><a href="https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=29058" target="_blank">image source</a></em><em>)</em><br></p><div><p>The game itself had taken Chris just a year to develop, but the journey to making it had begun much earlier.</p><p>Chris had started programming as a teenager in 1981, largely out of curiosity, through trying to make things appear on the screen on a range of different computers he’d encountered. There was the Commodore PET at his high school, the Sinclair ZX81 demonstration unit in a W H Smiths store, and the Texas Instruments TI99/4A one of his neighbours owned, as well as the Commodore VIC-20 a different neighbour had. And eventually, after diligently saving up his pocket money, he’d become engrossed in a machine of his own, a Camputers Lynx, a now-forgotten, obscure-even-then 8-bit computer with fancier graphics and more horsepower than the leading systems of its day (the leading systems at the time being the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64).</p><p>Here, in 1983, is where the journey really starts — where Chris set off towards the lands where he’d make his name. And I find it fascinating how serendipitous this was — for, you see, Chris’s two great successes, Transport Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon, were both made possible by his phenomenal systems knowledge; by his immense capacity to hand-code complex interactions of data at low levels of abstraction.</p><p>And here is where he began to learn those skills, to internalise them to the point of becoming natural talents. He later told Arcade Attack in an interview that he’d not had access to an assembler for that Lynx computer, so when he’d wanted to move beyond coding in BASIC he’d needed to write his programs byte-by-byte in machine code — the lowest-level programming language, the numerical instructions that computers themselves use. And with scant resources available to teach him these skills, he mostly figured it out on his own, just trying different things until he got his ideas to work. Always chasing the next exhilarating breakthrough.</p><p>Chris continued to dabble in machine code, though somewhat less than before, when he upgraded to a similarly-obscure machine called the Memotech MTX500, which actually did come with a built-in assembler, which enabled him to write programs in the abbreviation-heavy Z80 assembly language. Programs that, beginning in 1984, he very often had published commercially.</p></div><p><img alt="Memotech_MTX500-wide" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/memotech_mtx500-wide.jpg" width="1020" height="584"><br><em>The Memotech MTX500 (</em><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Memotech_MTX500.jpg" target="_blank">Image source</a></em><em>)</em><br></p><div><p>Chris had sent Memotech cassette tapes of some games he’d made through copying the designs of popular titles, like Missile Kommand, which was the 1980 Atari arcade game converted to the capabilities of the MTX500, using a mix of BASIC and machine code, with the name intentionally misspelled (a ‘k’ rather than a ‘c’) as though that somehow made his unapologetic, blatant clone of another’s work okay. </p><p>But this was the wild west of the computer games business, and Memotech weren’t much concerned. Or at least their games guy Jim Wills wasn’t much concerned, neither at this point nor a few months later when he left to start a company called Megastar Games. Jim liked Chris’s work enough to publish it, for meagre royalties but invaluable experience. And so Chris was commercially published with his unlicensed MTX500 versions of Missile Command, Q*bert, Manic Miner, and a few others.</p><p>After high school he enrolled in a computer science and microprocessor systems degree, where he studied the fundamentals of both software and hardware design in computers — an experience he found invaluable, as it taught him how to push computers further by learning how their hardware worked. And it taught him the theories behind the sorts of nitty-gritty software-systems things he’d already been practising at home: optimisation, sorting, algorithms, and even more varieties of machine code.</p></div><p><img alt="escape-from-zarcos-memotech-mtx500" src="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/escape-from-zarcos-memotech-mtx500.png" width="1044" height="788"><em><br>Escape from Zarcos, Chris Sawyer clone of Manic Miner for the Memotech MTX500</em><br></p><div><p>At home, meanwhile, he’d shifted over to the Amstrad CPC, which technologically-speaking wasn’t hugely different to the Memotech system he’d been on before — but it was a modest upgrade, and unlike his previous computers it was actually a popular system. And for Chris it was a gateway to the PC, because in the course of studying at university and making computer games on the side he wound up getting an Amstrad-made IBM-PC clone.</p><p>Chris had during this period been getting his games published through Ariolasoft, a German company with a UK subsidiary that promised him a job programming games for them once he graduated. Except some promises can’t be kept, especially in an industry that moves as fast as computer games publishing.</p><p>The home computer business was by that point deep into its transition from 8-bit to 16-bit hardware, and that transition came with adjustments to the standard of game graphics and design required, and to the way marketing and sales worked, and the cost of publishing, and so on, and Ariolasoft wasn’t doing too well at managing the transition. </p><p>So Chris didn’t have a job waiting for him after all, and he’d missed out on all the great electronics engineering jobs his classmates applied for. (Oops!) But not to worry — he’d made enough connections and enough headway as a programmer that he could get himself a business agent, and that agent in turn connected him to the booming Amiga-to-PC games porting industry.</p><p>He later said he’d thought it a “stop-gap” measure, just “a bit of fun” while he looked for more permanent employment in the electronics industry. But Chris took to his new conversions work like a duck to water. The kid who’d had to get creative and remain patient to make anything work on his Camputers Lynx machine now excelled in an environment where he had to contend with the vast gap in multimedia capabilities between the Amiga and the PC.</p><p>PCs of the day were pathetically inept as games machines, compared to a system like the Amiga. Whereas the PC had just a CPU, and maybe, in a minority of machines, a dedicated sound card like the SoundBlaster 16, every Amiga came with a custom chipset that contained audio and video co-processors that could take some strain off the …</p></div></div></div>

    <div><p>I remember when I was first learning about hash tables. I thought I stumbled across an ingenious optimization for dealing with hash collisions. Before explaining my optimization, let me first briefly explain how hash tables work and what hash collisions are. I also made a video if you're interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM9zhZB2KkM" title="Hash Tables"><img alt="" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/pM9zhZB2KkM/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Say that we have a hash that maps someone's name to their age. <code>"adam"</code> is <code>27</code>, so we want to enter that into our hash.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/qWdjbhM/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Here's what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"adam"</code> gets put through a hash function.</li>
<li>The hash function spits out <code>7</code>.</li>
<li><code>7</code> is the index of the array where we are going to store <code>"adam"</code>'s value.</li>
<li>So we store <code>27</code> into <code>array[7]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we run <code>hash.get("adam")</code> in the future and need to look up the value for <code>"adam"</code>, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>"adam"</code> through the hash function.</li>
<li>Get <code>7</code> as the output.</li>
<li>This means we have to look at <code>array[7]</code> to get the value.</li>
<li>So we look at <code>array[7]</code> to get our value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully if we have a key of <code>"alice"</code> or <code>"bob"</code> it'll hash to a different index. But... what happens if it hashes to the same index? That's called a hash collision.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/sJbJKnD/Slice.png"></p>
<p>A common approach is that if there's a collision, you store the values in a linked list.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/VJsSW3T/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Fair enough. That makes sense.</p>
<p>But wait!!! It takes <code>O(n)</code> time to look up a value in a linked list. Can't we use a binary search tree to speed that up to <code>O(log n)</code>???</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/R3Vrc10/Slice.png"></p>
<p>Or... can't we take it a step further and use a <em>hash inside of a hash</em> to get the lookup time all the way down to <code>O(1)</code>?!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ibb.co/7CyYNWY/Slice.png"></p>
<p>I hate to say it, but however many years ago when I had these thoughts, there were a few moments where I thought I was a genius. Now when I look back at that former self, I facepalm.</p>
<p>It is true that going from a linked list to a BST to a hash takes you from <code>O(n)</code> to <code>O(logn)</code> to <code>O(1)</code> lookup time. However, since collisions are rare, <code>n</code> is going to be small. And when <code>n</code> is small, <code>O(n)</code> might be faster than <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<p>To understand why that is, think back to what Big-O really means. I think it helps to think about it as a "math thing" instead of a "programming thing". Consider two functions:</p>
<pre><code>f(n) = 4n + 1000
g(n) = 2n^2 + 5
</code></pre>
<p>Big-O of <code>f</code> is <code>O(n)</code> and Big-O of <code>g</code> is <code>O(n^2)</code>. We just focus on the part that "really matters". When <code>n</code> gets really big, the fact that it's <code>4n</code> doesn't really matter. Nor does the <code>+ 1000</code>.</p>
<p>But what about when <code>n</code> is small? Well, let's look at happens when <code>n</code> is <code>5</code>:</p>
<pre><code>f(5) = 4(5) + 1000 = 20 + 1000 = 1020
g(5) = 2(5^2) + 5 = 2(25) + 5 = 50 + 5 = 55
</code></pre>
<p>Look at that! The <code>O(n^2)</code> function is almost 20 times faster than the <code>O(n)</code> function!</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> is basically why they use a linked list instead of a BST or hash to handle collisions. Since <code>n</code> is small, Big-O isn't the right question to ask.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's another example. I just wrote the following code while prepping for an interview:</p>
<pre><code>const isVowel = (char) =&gt; ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"].includes(char);
</code></pre>
<p>Normally I wouldn't think twice about it, but since interviewers care so much about time complexity, I stopped to think about whether it could be improved.</p>
<p>And it hit me that it's actually <code>O(n)</code>(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24660824">caveat</a>), because we've got an array and have to iterate over every element to see if the element matches <code>char</code>. It's easy to overlook this because we're using <code>includes</code> and not writing the code ourselves.</p>
<p>So then I thought that maybe we could use a hash instead to get <code>O(1)</code> lookup. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>const isVowel = (char) =&gt; {
  const vowels = {
    a: true,
    e: true,
    i: true,
    o: true,
    u: true,
  };

  return !!vowels[char];
};
</code></pre>
<p>But then I realized that this is the same mistake I made with the hash collision stuff however many years ago. <em><code>n</code> is small, so Big-O isn't the question we should be asking</em>. Here <code>n</code> is <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>I think that the array approach would actually be faster than the hash approach, even though it's <code>O(n)</code> instead of <code>O(1)</code>. The reason for this is called locality.</p>
<p>If you dive deep under the hood, when you look up an element in an array, the CPU actually grabs a bunch of adjacent elements as well as the one you wanted, and it stores the adjacent elements in a cache. So here when we look up <code>"a"</code> in the array, it'll probably grab <code>"a"</code>, <code>"e"</code>, <code>"i"</code>, <code>"o"</code>, and <code>"u"</code>. And so next time when we want to grab <code>"e"</code>, it can take it from the cache, which is a lot faster. This works because the elements in the array are close to each other in the physical memory. But with a hash, my understanding is that they wouldn't be so close, and thus we wouldn't benefit from this spatial locality effect.</p>
<p>I'm no low-level programming wiz so I'm not sure about any of this. That's ok, I think it's beside the point of this post. The real point of this post is that when you have a little <code>n</code>, Big-O doesn't matter.</p>
