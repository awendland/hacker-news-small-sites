      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I make a lot of weird stuff with AI; if you want to keep tabs on my work, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>

    <div itemprop="articleBody">

      <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>To make a default Vim installation more useful, type the following 5 lines into its <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hls
set ic
set is
set nu
set noswf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if you prefer, copy and paste the spelled out and annotated version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hlsearch    " highlight all search results
set ignorecase  " do case insensitive search 
set incsearch   " show incremental search results as you type
set number      " display line number
set noswapfile  " disable swap file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For what it’s worth, the acronym for the 5 lines is <code>HIINN</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410751" target="_blank">Multiple people on HN</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410742" target="_blank">have pointed out</a> that the 5 lines can be combined into a single line like below. I didn’t know about this capability, but will definitely start doing this from now on:</p>



<p>Also, as mentioned below, this is for temporary environments where you read more than you edit. For your local set up, it’s better to take the time to properly maintain the config file and install plugins as needed.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> is a powerful text editor for Unix/Linux, and I use it frequently to view and edit files. Unfortunately, Vim’s default configurations lack several important usability features compared to popular alternative text editors, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>.</p>

<p>The undesirable defaults are not an issue on my own computer, as I can take the time to configure them. However, often I’d find myself debugging or reading logs on near-fresh Linux installations (eg. virtual machines spun up to do integration testing), where Vim had not yet been configured.</p>

<p>So over time, I distilled the text editor features that I needed the most, and came up with the list above. To set it up, I would run <code>vim ~/.vimrc</code>, manually enter those 5 lines in whichever order that I remembered them, then quit and restart Vim to pick up the new configurations.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The first 4 lines are straightforward - most popular modern text editors already come with all of them out of the box. The last one could be controversial, since <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file" target="_blank">swap file</a> is designed to help users recover work. In practice though, I find it to be more in the way, due to the additional dialogue that pops up when opening a file that has an existing swap file. The recovery feature itself is also not useful to me, as I more often read logs rather than make edits in those cases.</p>

<p>The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, I recommend you to also try putting those 5 lines into the <code>.vimrc</code>. It could make your Vim experience just a bit better.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>San Francisco was poised to make a big improvement in its central transit system: the <a href="http://bettermarketstreetsf.org/index.html"><em>Better Market Street</em></a> plan. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Street_(San_Francisco)">Market Street</a> is one of the major transit arteries of the city, the route that people ride to commute from the Mission and the Haight to downtown.</p><p>It’s also a high-injury corridor, and the city aimed to fix that by creating a grade-separated bike lane and lots of new and improved infrastructure.</p><p><img alt="Better market plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-better-market-plan.png"></p><p>After years of community input and design, the plan was to introduce a separate lane for bikes, sidewalk improvements, separated lanes for buses, and more. It was pretty inspiring.</p><p><img alt="Post-pandemic revised plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-post-pandemic-revised-plan.png"></p><p>But the budget collapse caused by COVID-19 scaled back the project radically, and now we’re considering sharrows instead of separated bicycle lanes. The plan includes what you see above: a double-wide lane where bicyclists perilously “share the road” with taxis, delivery trucks, and city vehicles. It’s what we call <a href="https://bummermarketstreet.com/">Bummer Market Street</a>.</p><p>So I decided to look into the main anti-feature of this plan for cyclists: the sharrow.</p><h2

particular symbol that combines a bicycle icon with an arrow or house icon. Initially, the bicycle was <em>inside</em> the arrow, like it was in a little house, but recently it’s next to the arrow.</p><p>Sharrow symbols are painted on streets or applied with thermoplastic decals.</p><p>The purpose of a sharrow is to <em>encourage good bicyclist and driver behavior</em>. Sharrows don’t increase legal penalties for drivers or cyclists. They encourage cyclists to take the lane, but cyclists are permitted to do that anyway, on any narrow street. Sharrows are supposed to make motorists aware of cyclists. When drivers kill people in sharrows, there aren’t any additional consequences. The consequences for hitting people with cars are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/is-it-ok-to-kill-cyclists.html">minimal</a>.</p><p>Sharrows do constitute <a href="http://www.cityofamericancanyon.org/home/showdocument?id=3474">class III bikeways</a>, which bring with them higher penalties for illegal parking.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-denver-sharrow.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Denver sharrow" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-denver-sharrow.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicajuriga/5066431139">A sharrow in Denver, Colorado / photo by Jess J</a></figcaption><p>James Mackay invented the sharrow in 1993 in Denver, in hopes that it would legitimize bicycles on the road, encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, and reduce wrong-way cycling:</p><blockquote><p>I was hoping the shared lane marking would legitimize the presence of bicyclists, reinforce the correct direction of travel and assign lane position, including the correct approach to an intersection and fill an intermediate niche where typical bike lane markings might not necessarily fit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But I was hoping it overall would provide a step in the right direction towards legitimizing the presence of bicycling and reinforcing bicycle usage. - <a href="https://www.thebicyclestory.com/2016/03/episode-4-a-brief-history-of-the-american-sharrow/">The Bicycle Story: James Mackay</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="what-are-sharrows-supposed-to-do">What are sharrows supposed to do?</h2><p>This is a really important question, because the answer isn’t simply “to protect people.” San Francisco and many other cities have versions of Vision Zero, the idea that traffic deaths should be reduced to zero.</p><p>Sharrows aren’t a general-purpose tool: their applicability and goal is quite specific.</p><p><a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part9/part9c.htm">According to the MUTCD</a>, sharrows may be used to:</p><ol><li>Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in a shared lane with on-street parallel parking in order to reduce the chance of a bicyclist’s impacting the open door of a parked vehicle.</li><li>Assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in lanes that are too narrow for a motor vehicle and a bicycle to travel side by side within the same traffic lane.</li><li>Alert road users of the lateral location bicylists are likely to occupy within the traveled way.</li><li>Encourage safe passing of bicyclists by motorists, and</li><li>Reduce the incidence of wrong-way bicycling.</li></ol><p>The purpose of sharrows is thus pretty tied to the problem of <em>dooring</em>, in which drivers don’t look out of their rear-view window before swinging open their doors. Behavioral solutions to dooring, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dooring#Dutch_Reach">Dutch Reach</a>, haven’t caught on in America because it’s America.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-a-sharrow-in-oakland-california.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="A sharrow in Oakland, California" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-a-sharrow-in-oakland-california.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4920881091">A sharrow in Oakland, California / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><p>The <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Shared-Lane-Markings-When-and-Where-to-Use-Them.pdf">SFMTA</a> proposed additional use-cases for sharrows: Hills, Narrow Streets, Discontinued Bike Lane due to Roadway Narrowing, Discontinued Bike Lane for Right Turn Lane, Lane Drop for Right Turn Only Lane, Double Turn Lanes, Double Turn Lanes with Bike Box, Route Finding, Roundabouts or Traffic Circles, Along Separated Bikeways, and Space for Only One Bike Lane.</p><p>None of this describes the Market Street plan, which would be a double-sharrow in a scenario with no on-street parking.

a <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/City-of-Toronto-Cycling-Study-Tracking-Report-1999-and-2009.pdf">2009 City of Toronto study</a>, 77% of bicyclists said that to “separate bike lanes from car traffic” would improve cycling “a great deal”, more than any other change. Columbus, Ohio asked in 2008 what infrastructure cyclists would want to see, and 85% of respondents referred to bicycle lanes, with only 76% seeing a benefit to shared-use paths.</p><p>Bicycle advocacy organizations also don’t want sharrows: the new Better Market Street plans were <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">immediately panned by the SF Bicycle Coalition</a>.</p><h3 id="do-sharrows-inform-drivers-of-the-presence-of-bicyclists">Do sharrows inform drivers of the presence of bicyclists?</h3><p>We have a few sources of data here. Let’s look at the <a href="https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/San-Franciscos-Shared-Lane-Pavement-Markings-Improving-Bicycle-Safety.pdf">San Francisco Shared Lane Marking Study</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The majority of the drivers surveyed claimed not to notice the markings. Since the sample size of drivers was so small, the results do not provide conclusive findings. -p13</p></blockquote><p>Do drivers understand the markings?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists that responded, two out of the seven that noticed the markings understood that the marking indicate that they should allow more room for cyclists. p14</p></blockquote><p>There’s a study from Brookline, MA. Do drivers notice markings there?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists surveyed, only 21% noticed the markings and were at least 70% confident that the markings indicated a preferred zone for bicycling.</p></blockquote><p>Casual observations from Warren Vermont:</p><blockquote><p>Casual verbal survey of approximately 200 local citizens and 50 bicyclists led to conclusion that bicyclists felt the symbols were too small to be effective and local drivers rarely noticed them. The Vermont DOT decided to not encourage their use, to not replace them, and to not include them in future plans</p></blockquote><p>Do cyclists understand the symbols? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp1gN8xsz3o">Here’s a news report about how they don’t</a>. The city of Fremont had to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qg6cpG7Zeg">publish a video about how to use sharrows</a>.</p><h3 id="do-sharrows-make-streets-safer">Do sharrows make streets safer?</h3><p>A striking commonality in the sharrow research is that safety is not clearly measured. Proxies to safety are measured: cyclists riding in the center of the lane, in the right direction, not on sidewalks, and sometimes the distance from cars to bikes. The Texas study does an impressive amount of statistical reasoning about passing events &amp; horizontal positioning on the street. But actual safety is not rigorously measured.</p><p>The one study that directly studies the effectiveness of bicycle sharrows <em>for safety</em> is called <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1393928"><em>The Relative (In)Effectiveness of Bicycle Sharrows on Safety Outcomes</em></a>. It’s a quick read, but the killer line is:</p><blockquote><p>Results suggest that not only are sharrows not as safe as bike lanes, but they could be more dangerous than doing nothing at all.</p></blockquote><p>This probably isn’t the question you care about, right? Proper horizontal positioning isn’t one of the <a href="https://www.visionzerosf.org/">Vision Zero SF</a> goals. Bicyclists don’t talk that much about proper horizontal positioning.</p><p>But nevertheless: proper horizontal positioning is one of the key goals of sharrows. Three of the five goals outlined in the MUTCD are different kinds of proper horizontal positioning. The first goal of San Francisco’s study was horizontal positioning. Most of the sharrow-related data collected is about horizontal positioning.</p><p>As Ferenchak &amp; Marshall note, there is mixed evidence for horizontal positioning in correctly-painted sharrows.</p><p>Amusingly, though, there are a lot of sharrows that don’t even encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, because they’re painted in the “door zone”: exactly the area that cyclists are supposed to stay away from.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Door-zone sharrow in Chicago" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/38067633996">A sharrow in Chicago that has been painted exactly in the 'door zone' which sharrows are supposed to keep bicycles out of / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><h2 id="why-dont-sharrows-go-away">Why don’t sharrows go away?</h2><p>I’m not the first to point out the uselessness of sharrows. The In(effectiveness) study by Ferenchak and Marshall got airtime on <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/14/study-sharrows-dont-make-streets-safer-for-cycling/">Streetsblog</a> and <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/sharrows-shared-lane-markings-street-cyslists-may-hurt-help/">99 Percent Invisible</a>. The bicycle coalition immediately <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">opposed San Francisco’s new sharrows</a>. Ferenchak and Marshall <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2046043018300583">expanded their research with additional data</a>.</p><p>One defense of sharrows is that they’re <em>part of a larger strategy</em>: why not have all the tools in the toolbox? This is sort of like justifying the addition of some homeopathics in your ambulance medical kit. Sure, you have it now, but it’s not going to do anything.</p><h2 id="how-sharrows-snuck-into-transportation-planning">How sharrows snuck into transportation planning</h2><p>Sharrows started as a brutal compromise. The creator of the sharrow, James Mackay, essentially said that it was a bare-minimum way to do <em>something</em> for cycling in a city that didn’t want to do anything:</p><blockquote><p>Part of it was the city of Denver’s reluctance to do much of anything for bicycles. So I figured, this would be a less expensive approach versus the conventional bike lane markings. A lot of the agencies don’t want to do anything involving change or spending money for bicycles. I was always under pressure to do less as the Denver bicycle planner.</p></blockquote><p>In this form, as a temporary measure in the evolution of cities away from cars, sharrows made sense.</p><p>And sharrows <em>are</em> successful, to some degree, at encouraging cyclists to avoid the “door zone.” And those small, measurable improvements in ‘horizontal positioning’ bought the sharrow’s way into transit device standards.</p><p>Then cities started pushed sharrows in all sorts of scenarios that needed bike lanes, not a temporary, toothless symbol on the asphalt. And since they’re cheap and don’t disrupt car traffic, they caught on.</p><p>But sharrows have overreached and underperformed. Any …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy announced its intention to offer $400M of debt to investors, and a plan to purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds.</p><p>This was the 4th time MicroStrategy announced plans to buy Bitcoin, but for the first time, the market had a strong negative reaction to MicroStrategy's announcement.</p><p>On December 8th, Microstrategy's stock was down by 14%, their largest single-day decline since March 18th.</p><p>Why the negative reaction? Because this time the Bitcoin would be bought with other people's money, instead of the cash reserves already on MicroStrategy's balance sheet.</p><p>Despite the negative reaction, this bet makes a ton of sense.</p><p>MicroStrategy is a business generating tens of millions of dollars in annual cash flow from operations, they've got almost no long-term debt, and they have access to some of the cheapest capital in the world.</p><p>They also have an ongoing Bitcoin bet that has returned over 50% in a few months, and this offering gives them an opportunity to almost double the stakes.</p><p>Let's break down the potential upside and downside of MicroStrategy's latest debt offering.</p><h2>Microstrategy's Debt Offering</h2><p>First, let's look at the type of debt MicroStrategy offered investors.</p><p>They offered "unsecured senior convertible notes", a quick break-down of the term is below.</p><p><strong>Unsecured:</strong> Microstrategy is not giving investors ownership of any assets as collateral. For investors, this obviously comes with a higher risk than debt secured by some underlying asset like real estate or equipment.</p><p><strong>Convertible:</strong> Microstrategy can convert this debt into shares of Microstrategy or cash. The equity conversion rate for the notes will be 2.5126 shares of MicroStrategy per $1,000 of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $397.99 per share. Microstrategy currently trades for less, so this strategy only makes sense when the stock value rises above $398.</p><p><strong>Senior:</strong> If Microstrategy defaults on its debt, company assets are paid out to creditors in priority sequence.</p><p>Secured debt is paid off first, then unsecured debt, and then finally the equity shareholders get whatever is left (if anything). Within each priority level, there are sub-levels of priority. Senior secured debt is paid back before junior secured debt, senior notes are paid off before junior notes, and preferred stock is paid off before common stock.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> A particular kind of corporate debt, typically with a maturity period of 10 years or less.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Debt Offering Timeline</h3><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy's intention was to offer:</p><ul role="list"><li>$400M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $60M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 9th, MicroStrategy officially priced their offering at:</p><ul role="list"><li>$550M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025, with a semi-annual interest payment at 0.75% APY</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $100M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 11th, MicroStrategy closed the round of fundraising, and sold the extra $100 million option too. As a result, their net proceeds were $634.9 million after fees.</p><p>And with that money, they plan to buy more Bitcoin - since they've already converted 100% of their cash and short-term investments into Bitcoin.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Bet In A Nutshell</h3><p>Here's what this entire bet boils down to.</p><p>MicroStrategy must pay $4.9M in each of the next five years as interest on their debt offering. That adds up to $24.4M in interest payments, plus a lump sum payment of the $650M original debt offering in December 2025.</p><p>That's a grand total of $674.4M paid off over the course of 5 years.</p><p>But there's a bonus option for MicroStrategy. If their Bitcoin bet pays off and they want to de-leverage, or if their stock price rises above $400, they have the option to convert some or all of the debt into equity or cash.</p><p>From the $650M offering, MicroStrategy expects to keep $634.9M that they can invest in Bitcoin. The other $15.1 million goes towards various fees and commissions.</p><p>Therefore, to turn their $634.9M into $674.4M, they'll just need a 1.2% annual return on their Bitcoin investment. </p><p>In other words, assuming MicroStrategy acquires Bitcoin around $18,750 per coin, they'll have paid for all 5 years of interest payments once Bitcoin hits $19,916 per coin. Anything above that is all profit.</p><h2>MicroStrategy's Upside Potential</h2><h3>How Much Could MicroStrategy Make?</h3><p>MicroStrategy has made 3 prior Bitcoin purchases.</p><ul role="list"><li>They're up $152M (61%) on their $250M August investment</li><li>They're up $140M (80%) on their $175M September investment</li><li>They're roughly even on their $50M December investment (made last week).</li></ul><p>All together, their $475M of cash is now worth $765M (up 61%) in just a few months.</p><p>With this $634.9M of cash from investors, they can buy just under 35,000 more coins. Since they already have 40,824 BTC, they will likely hold over 75,000 BTC by the end of December.</p><h3>How Much Higher Might Bitcoin Go?</h3><p>Obviously this is unknowable, and no prediction will be perfect when we look back five years from now. Still, there are enough influential figures in finance who have put out Bitcoin price predictions that it would be unwise to ignore them completely.</p><p>In addition, these people have all been successful capital allocators outside of the Bitcoin world, so their stance on Bitcoin as an asset class is less biased than the price predictions one might find on Bitcoin Twitter. They don't need Bitcoin to succeed, but they still think it will.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwHI6OC3rc8">Raoul Pal</a>: $1M per coin in the next five years</p><p><a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/the-case-for-500k-bitcoin/">Winklevoss Twins</a>: $500k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/classicmacro/status/1327381449000034307">Citibank Analyst Tom Fitzpatrick</a>: A move as high as $318k per coin by December 2021</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/12/social-capitals-palihapitiya-says-bitcoin-is-going-to-1-million-in-the-next-20-years.html">Chamath Palihapitiya [in 2017]</a>: Probably 100k per coin in the next 3-4 years, and I think it is in the next 20 years, $1M per coin</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1328492371353489408">Mike Novogratz</a>: Going to 65k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p>I'm sure I've missed a handful of price predictions, but you get the point.</p><p>On the high end, if Bitcoin gets to $1M/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $75B by 2025.</p><p>On the low end, if Bitcoin gets to $65k/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $4.9B by 2025.</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Microstrategy has massive upside potential if Bitcoin's price gets anywhere close to the predictions above. But what if it doesn't?</p><h2>Microstrategy's Downside Risk</h2><h3><strong>What Happens To MicroStrategy If Bitcoin Goes Down?</strong></h3><p>It's possible that Bitcoin's price in December 2025 may be lower than it is today, but it's not very likely. In its 12 year history, Bitcoin has never traded down over a five year period, and it's not even close. 5 years ago, it was trading for $436. It is now trading for $18,750.</p><p>That's a 42x gain since December 12, 2015.</p><p>Still, the past isn't always a good predictor of the future, so let's explore MicroStrategy's options if Bitcoin does have a negative 5 year return.</p><p>Microstrategy has a profitable business generating tens of millions of dollars in operating cash flow each year. In fact, from 2016-2019 they've averaged $65M of cash flow from operations per year.</p><p>That's plenty of safety margin to take care of their $4.12 million annual interest payment, assuming zero business growth and zero inflation. If either one is positive, it will be even easier to meet their interest payment obligations.</p><h3>What Happens If Bitcoin And MicroStrategy Go Down?</h3><p>Ok, but what happens if Microstrategy's business doesn't generate any cash in the next five years, and the price of Bitcoin is lower in 2025?</p><p>Even more unlikely considering MicroStrategy's track record of success dates back to 1989, but let's entertain the possibility. What can MicroStrategy do about a rough spell for both Bitcoin and their business?</p><p>First, they could issue more debt.</p><p>MicroStrategy's largest long-term liability is its office space, and otherwise the company carries almost no long-term debt on their balance sheet.</p><p>At a time when central banks are relentlessly printing money, and bond yields are basically zero, raising another round of low-interest capital in the future won't be a challenge.</p><p>Second, a remote-first future means they may not even have to raise more money.</p><p>Prior to 2020, Michael Saylor strongly believed in-person work was important for MicroStrategy's success, but the global lockdown in the spring changed his mind.</p><p>If MicroStrategy does pursue a long-term remote work approach, that eliminates their largest long-term liability. As their $100M of lease obligations for office space gradually expires, the extra money can help fund their debt interest payments. It's not a big enough saving to pay off their debt principal, but it gives them extra time to either raise more capital or improve their business cash flows.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>MicroStrategy investors didn't run the numbers when they heard of this debt offering announcement last week, they panicked.</p><p>Microstrategy is a well-run, capital efficient business that took advantage of low interest rates to protect their purchasing power. While their Bitcoin allocation is aggressive by Wall Street standards, it's nothing that might risk the future of their software business.</p><p>And if it works out, it will be remembered as a bold (and very successful) bet that permanently shifted the way Wall Street thinks about Bitcoin.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>Recently Google Photos ended their unlimited storage. You shouldn’t have been shocked, because unlimited is more often than not an unsustainable Ponzi Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="good-at-business">Good at Business</h2>

<p>When a software company gives you unlimited storage for anything, the only way for them to maintain that business in the long run is for them to make (amortized or not) incremental and recurring money from each thing they store. This is true, because storage is a recurring and forever cost.</p>

<p>Most B2C companies don’t make recurring money off of the data they store for you. They make money inversely proportional to how recent you stored the thing. Sometimes they don’t make any money at all. So it’s no surprise that unlimited is a Ponzi scheme, because that’s the only way to make the ledger look right.</p>

<h2 id="the-unlimited-ponzi-scheme">The Unlimited Ponzi Scheme</h2>

<p>Businesses will often follow a Ponzi Scheme-esque model with storage for their product. As they go through growth, newer customers are instantly delivering new revenue while their cost is very little - they haven’t started accruing much data. These customers offset older customers, who are getting more expensive as data retention continues forever.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the growth stops. You’ve gained most of the market you’re going to gain.  All of the sudden margin starts to slip. Fewer new users exist to offset the old users People look into and realize the unlimited scheme is up. Then they implement a retention policy and customers freak out.</p>

<h2 id="handling-unlimited-as-a-business">Handling Unlimited as a Business</h2>

<p>Businesses often fail at unlimited in a few ways.</p>

<p>First, companies should offer a way to pay more to get more storage. I can’t be mad that you won’t run a ridiculous business for me. I will get mad if you sink me into your product and don’t give me the option to pay a fair value to continue service.</p>

<p>Second, companies should be mindful of data retention policies from day 1.  The unlimited Ponzhi scheme is in many products not something that companies even know is happening. Things look good  until they don’t.</p>

<p>If you keep data around without retention policies, you will face a long road of performance, stability, and customer issues as you scale. Especially as your growth numbers slow, you should be mindful of the upcoming business realities sooner rather than later if you have anything that is unlimited in your product.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There’s no free lunch in this world unless you’re willing to run around to different dumpsters to get it.</p>

  <div>
    <p>In news that surprises nobody, Goodreads last week quietly announced the deprecation of their public APIs. And I mean really quietly – the only people who were told about this were those unfortunate enough to have their existing <a href="https://blog.stephanieawilkinson.com/posts/2020-12-10-yonderbook-and-goodreads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API keys disabled</a> without warning. Other than a small banner at the top of the API docs which mentions vague “plans to retire these tools”, nobody else appears to have heard anything from Goodreads, including those whose API keys remain active. So far it seems any key unused for 30 days has been disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://joealcorn.co.uk/assets/img/posts/2020/12/deprecated.png" alt="Deprecation notice on Goodreads API documentation"></p>

<p>So this is an “announcement” much in the way a windshield announces its presence to bugs on a highway, and with the same consequences: dead bugs. Some developers have taken to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21788520-api-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API discussion boards</a> and blogs, but the overall impression I’m getting is grim acceptance. Really the surprising thing is how long it took them: Amazon has been in charge at Goodreads for almost 8 years now, and I think we’ve all been expecting this to come at some point.</p>

<p>So why now? What’s changed? Well, the fact is the market’s changing – and Goodreads isn’t. Alternative options are starting to emerge, and since Goodreads has forgotten how to innovate, it wants to use its market position to stifle innovation instead.</p>

<p>The sad thing is it really only hurts the hobbyist projects and Goodreads users themselves. Anybody seriously attempting to compete with Goodreads is well aware of the Amazon-shaped elephant in the room and is likely prepared. It’s the users and the hackers that this move will harm, and if anything it further reinforces the need for viable alternatives.</p>

<p>Personally I’m going to continue pouring my efforts into building <a href="https://beta.readng.co/?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readng</a>. I’m already using it to keep track of my reads &amp; collections, along with a few thousand beta testers. I’m really excited by our plans and think we have the right team to execute, but we also need a shift in consumer behaviour.</p>

<p>The web has to mature beyond advertising as a business model. For this to happen people are going to have to open their wallets, pay for the services they use, and support independent businesses. That’s how we build a web where indies can thrive - one that’s more village centre than financial centre. I think the shift is underway.</p>

<p>PS: <a href="https://beta.readng.co/user/joe?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s my own readng profile</a>. You should probably use our Goodreads importer while our API key works, huh?</p>

    <p>by Francis Tseng</p>

<p>The application that introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing to the mainstream was file sharing, services like Napster, Kazaa, Gnutella, and BitTorrent. For me, these programs were the first time the contradiction of artificial scarcity—the imposed scarcity of infinitely replicable digital information—and the excessive measures that were used to enforce it became startlingly clear. Over time, I encountered the term P2P in other settings and alongside other ideas—democratic governance, communalism, autonomy, cooperatives—and I started to see the purchase this idea had beyond file sharing and networking protocols.</p>

<p><a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/the-p2p-foundation/about-the-p2p-foundation">The P2P Foundation’s mission and strategic priorities</a>, for example, extend the early P2P ideas of open culture and exchange into values of cooperative living and regenerative production. <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles/">Scuttlebutt, a more recent P2P social networking protocol, has its own “principles stack”</a> that similarly advocates pluralistic exchange and mutual interdependence. It’s beautiful how, at least in the ideal scenario, by using a P2P service we are helping others access it as well. P2P is both an acknowledgment of our shared needs and an example of how cooperation helps us fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve followed along with P2P projects because of these shared values, and I always find it exciting when new projects emerge. It seems that P2P is experiencing something of a renaissance, likely due to the frenzy around blockchain (which purports to offer something similar to P2P) and the increasing popular anxiety around centralized internet services like Facebook.</p>

<p>Urbit, “<a href="https://urbit.org/">a personal server built from scratch</a>,” first came across my radar a couple of years ago. Urbit positions itself as a P2P project, but it stands out in contrast to other P2P projects, mainly because the person behind it, Curtis Yarvin, seems antithetical to what I understand P2P to represent.</p>

<p>My central question is this: <em>Is Urbit a project that should be supported?</em></p>

<p>We can further break this down into two parts. First, Urbit’s marketing materials correctly identify that concentrated data aggregation and decision-making power are fundamental issues of the internet-as-we-know-it. Twitter’s persistent neglect of harassment on its platform is one everyday example. It is clear that new protocols and platforms that reduce our dependency on distant power are needed to challenge these issues. What’s less clear, though, is whether or not Urbit actually offers a meaningful alternative. Does Urbit genuinely enable new kinds of relations? Or, does it merely replace the old aristocracy with a new one?</p>

<p>The second, and more urgent, question is: who and what are we supporting by supporting Urbit? Many people in tech still believe that technology can be divorced from its creators; however, those of us in tech need to recognize that we have a considerable amount of influence over which products enter the mainstream consciousness, which products get created at all, and who receives both financial and social capital (shout out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> et al.). For example, consider Peter Thiel , who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Early support of PayPal and Facebook contributed to their financial success, which developed Thiel’s influence and made him quite rich. Thiel then turned that money and influence into Palantir Technologies, a software company that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/">develops technologies to help expand surveillance and deportation for the government</a>. We have to consider what similar groundwork we help to lay by supporting Urbit.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>In order to discuss Urbit’s design, we need to have an understanding of the politics of its creator, Curtis Yarvin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin">Curtis Yarvin</a> is innocuously described on Wikipedia as an “American political theorist and computer scientist,” but to many, he is better known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/">one of the intellectual forebears of the alt-right</a>. From 2007 to 2014<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, working under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin writings, which among other things espoused anti-democratic ideas and scientific racism and helped introduce many of what are now understood as the alt-right’s foundational ideologies to a wider public. The term “red pill,” which describes the process of reactionary radicalization and the community around it, was first used in this way by Yarvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Defenders of Urbit are quick to dismiss any inclusion of Yarvin’s politics in discussions about Urbit as unfair or irrelevant, and might point out that Yarvin left the project in January of this year.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> However, given that Yarvin basically laid out the general design for Urbit independently, as he worked on it alone for 11 years<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and in parallel with his political writings<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and that Urbit, as a P2P project, is a fundamentally social and thus incorporates ideas about how people should be organized, Yarvin’s politics should be considered as something that influences his design decisions and his long-term vision for the project. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/z5j1hq/urbit_2017#c_4z4gik">Dog-whistles</a> have been identified in some of his writing about Urbit and its design, including his <a href="https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">leaning on Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt</a> for questions around Urbit’s governance.</p>

<p>To save space I’ll provide only a very brief overview of Yarvin’s political philosophy—if you like, you can read more about it <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis">here</a>, <a href="https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/">here</a>, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">here</a>, and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yavin refers to his brand of political philosophy as “neocameralism.” Neocameralism, as described in his essay “<a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/against-political-freedom/">Against Political Freedom</a>,” is a political philosophy arguing that state should be run like a business, (i.e., with a CEO at its head and no democratic mechanisms). His ideas are credited as being foundational to the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">neoreactionary” movement</a>, which could be described as a neo-monarchist movement (though Yarvin himself doesn’t identify as a “monarchist” because of its association with a constitutional monarchy and not absolute monarchy). In the neoreactionary movement, “divine right” is supplanted with “genetic right” based on scientific racism reframed as “human biodiversity.” Yarvin’s writings are also popular within the right-libertarian sects of Silicon Valley, such as <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">with Peter Thiel</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon">Peter Thiel also has a stake in Tlön</a>, Yarvin’s company which develops Urbit, via Thiel’s VC firm, Founders Fund). The point here is that Yarvin is not a fringe philosopher. His writings have influence over people with considerable power and contributes to the intellectual miasma that emboldens and normalizes anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic, and racist policies and attacks.</p>

<h2 id="urbit">Urbit</h2>
<h4 id="a-self-sovereign-internet">A self-sovereign internet</h4>

<p>Urbit positions itself as infrastructure for self-sovereignty in the digital age, liberating people from ceding control of their data to corporations.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The core idea is that Urbit helps you run a personal server that acts as an intermediary between you and other services, including existing services like Facebook (yes, there is a lot more to Urbit—such as its reinvention of parts of the lower-level computational stack—but its P2P layer is what’s of interest here).</p>

<p>Self-sovereignty is an important principle, and I wager that many who regularly use the internet would agree that more of it is valuable for a healthy internet: for being able to control who can access your data, who can and cannot contact you, and so on. <em>But</em>, self-sovereignty is far too vague of a concept on its own. Left- and right-libertarianism both start with self-sovereignty as a core value, but they end up with vastly different conceptions of what meaningful self-sovereignty looks like and how it can be achieved. Left-libertarianism finds that self-sovereignty arises from social organizing, care, and democratic governance, which build towards positive freedoms (freedom to learn, to flourish, and so on); whereas, right-libertarianism believes it comes from the market and that negative freedoms (freedom from restrictions and regulation) are the goal. Though Yarvin does not identify as a libertarian (he is, in his own words, sympathetic to it), his neocameralism is right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> of corporate tyranny and serfdom.</p>

<p>To draw an example that you might be familiar with, consider the Twitter-alternative, Gab, which markets itself as a bastion for free speech. Gab, in practice, operates as a niche platform for members of the far-right who have been banned from Twitter: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html">a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists</a>”. We might ask then, is Gab a platform for free speech, or is it a platform for hate speech? Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.</p>

<p>In a similar way, this slipperiness of self-sovereignty as a concept, especially in light of Yarvin’s political writings, makes me suspicious of what it really means in the context of Urbit. Is Urbit actually designed to give users more autonomy and control? Does it restore any power to internet users?</p>

<p>One central design feature of Urbit is its network hierarchy. As a participant in Urbit, you may be a galaxy (the top of the hierarchy), a star (which fall under galaxies), or a planet (which fall under stars). The description of this hierarchy <a href="https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/6ac688960687aa9c89d4da6fff49a3125c10aca1/Spec/urbit/3-intro.txt">used to use explicitly feudal metaphors</a> as part of what Yarvin called “digital feudalism,” with himself as the “prince,” and further contributes to my suspicion of Yarvin’s conception of self-sovereignty actually entails.</p>

<p>In trying to backpedal on these naming conventions, Yarvin claims that his ideas about governance are flipped for the internet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the real world today is governed as an insanely dysfunctional republic, and the Internet today is governed as a cluster of insanely despotic corporate monarchies, it doesn’t strike me as at all inconsistent with historical thought to treat the former case of misgovernment with efficient monarchism, and the latter case with liberating republicanism.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, ch. 7.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Active Listening</em>:<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
<a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/active-listening.pdf">Active Listening</a>, p. 2</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Similarly, advice and information are almost always seen as efforts to change a person and thus serve as barriers to his self-expression and the development of a creative relationship.</p></blockquote><p>You can find similar advice in most books on relationships, people management, etc.</p><p>This always used to seem silly to me. If I complain at my partner and she “just listens,” I’ve accomplished nothing except maybe made her empathetically sad. When I complain at people, I want <em>results</em>, not to grouse into the void!<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
Empirically, I did notice that I usually got better results from listening than from giving advice. So I inferred that this advice was true for other people, but not me, because other people didn’t actually want to fix their problems.</span></span></sup></p><p>Frequently the “just listen” advice comes with tactical tips, like “reflect what people said back to you to prove that you’re listening.” For instance, consider these example dialogues from <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>:<sup><label for="sn3">§</label><span><span><sup>§</sup>
<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, Chapter 7, Exercise 5.5, 5.6 and solutions.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?</p><p>Person B: Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked me to agree to do what you requested?</p></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><p>Person A: I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him.</p><p>Person B: So you’re feeling furious because you would like him to be around more than he is?</p></blockquote><p>I say this with great respect for <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, but these sound like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">1970s-era chatbot</a>. If I were Person A in either of these dialogues my next line would be “yes, you dingbat—can you turn the nonviolence down a couple notches?” I’d feel alienated knowing that someone is going through their NVC checklist on me.</p><hr><p>Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners <em>do</em> often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" target="_blank">cargo cult advice</a>: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what’s actually important, the thing that’s <em>generating</em> that surface appearance.</p><p>The generator is curiosity.</p><p>When I’ve listened the most effectively to people, it’s because I was intensely curious—I was trying to build a <em>detailed, precise</em> understanding of what was going on in their head. When a friend says, “I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him,” that one sentence has a huge amount underneath. How often does she need him? What does she need him for? Why isn’t he around? Have they talked about it? If so, what did he say? If not, why not?</p><p>It turns out that <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding" target="_blank">open it up and see the gears inside</a>. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.</p><p>Some stories from recent memory:</p><ul><li><p>When we started doing a pair programming rotation at Wave, I suggested that, to make scheduling easier, we designate a default time when pairing sessions would happen. A coworker objected that this seemed authoritarian. I was extremely puzzled, but they’d previously mentioned being an anarchist, so I was tempted to just chalk it up to a political disagreement and move on. But instead I tried to get curious and explore more deeply whatever “political” models were generating that disagreement. After a lot of digging into what was or wasn’t authoritarian for them and why, it turned out the disagreement was because they’d missed the word “default” and thought I was suggesting a single <em>mandatory</em> time for pair programming.</p></li><li><p>My partner, Eve, wrote a post about Polish attitudes about sex, with some details that upset her (Polish) parents. When her parents told her that, she initially got very stressed about having to have a conversation to calm them down. I thought she shouldn’t be worried and the conversation would be fine, but of course just telling her that wasn’t very helpful. Instead, I summoned up my curiosity and asked lots of questions about her relationship with her parents, her parents’ relationship with each other, each of their relationships with Catholicism, etc. By the end of the conversation, after thinking through all the baggage involved, Eve agreed with me, and her attitude about the upcoming conversation shifted from impending doom to compassionate curiosity about where her parents were coming from.</p></li><li><p>I was stressed by work and complained to Eve about some things that I felt frustrated and stuck about. Instead of suggesting solutions, she kept asking for more details until she had more or less a complete snapshot of my mental state. At that point, she observed that every time I mentioned feeling sad, I sounded contemptuous and exasperated with myself. She hypothesized that I wasn’t giving myself permission to be sad. The “solution” to my problem ended up being to give me a big hug and let me cry on her shoulder for a bit, after which I immediately felt much less stressed.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the “helper” tried to learn about the “complainer’s” reality in as much detail as possible—not just the problem, but the whole person and whatever else was behind the immediate issue. And that’s what made it possible for them to actually help.</p><p>It often feels like I understand enough to be helpful without knowing all those details. But when I think that, I’m usually wrong: I end up giving bad advice, based on bad assumptions, and the person I’m talking to ends up having to do a bunch of work to argue with me and correct my bad assumptions. That makes the conversation feel disfluent and adversarial instead of collaborative.</p><p>It turns out this is a really common failure mode of helping-conversations, which is what I think generates the old saw at the beginning of this post, that “sometimes people don’t want help, just to be listened to.”</p><p>But I think that’s actually too nice to the helper, and uncharitable to the complainer (in that it assumes they weirdly don’t care about solving their problem). What’s really going on is probably that your advice is bad, because you didn’t really listen, because you weren’t curious enough.</p><hr><p>When I’m curious about what someone’s saying, I often do repeat things back to them in my own words. But it’s because I’m genuinely curious, not because I’m checking off the “reflect words” box in my “be a good listener” checklist. That means I do it in a way that sounds like my natural speech, instead of mimicking them like a chatbot.</p><p>When done this way, reflective listening feels validating rather than alienating. It’s a way of demonstrating that I care a lot about what someone has to say. Putting their idea into my own words shows them that I’ve fully digested it, and helps us establish a shared language in which to talk about it. That, in turn, makes the conversation fluent and collaborative, rather than a zigzag of bad assumptions and corrections.</p><p>So the right advice isn’t “listen harder and repeat everything back”—you won’t be genuine if you’re just imitating the surface appearance of a good listener. Instead, be humble and get curious! Remind yourself that there’s a ton of detail behind whatever you’re hearing, and try to internalize all of it that you can. Once you’ve done that, your advice will be more likely hit the mark, and you’ll be able to communicate it clearly.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>To start: yes, long time no see. Well, COVID-19 has been like that. Some days I
feel accomplished if I successfully check my email. I finally managed to clear
out a backlog of an entire handfull of things that needed thoughtful responses,
though, and so here I am, screaming into the void instead of at anyone in
particular.</p>
<p>That said, let's talk a bit about radios. It is probably unsurprising by now
that I have a long-running interest in radio and especially digital radio
communications---but people who come to radio from all kinds of different
perspectives run into one odd problem: the curious refusal of any receiver
to tune to certain frequencies in the 800-900MHz range.</p>
<p>A lot of people have a general knowledge that this has to do with some kind of
legal prohibition on reception of cellular phones. That's roughly correct, but
to fully explain the matter requires going into some depth on two different
topics: FCC regulation of radio devices, and the development of cellular
phones. The first sounds more boring, so let's hit that one first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most electronic products manufactured or imported into the
United States are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission. Specifically, they generally require an "Equipment Authorization"
from the FCC prior to being marketed. For purposes of this regulatory scheme,
electronic devices can be broadly divided into two categories: intentional
radiators and unintentional radiators.</p>
<p>An intentional radiator is something that is specifically intended to broadcast
a radio signal, like, say, a cellular phone. Intentional radiators must be
certified to comply with the specific Part of the FCC regulations relevant to
the service for which they will be used. For example, cellular phones must be
certified against Part 27, Wireless Communications Service, among others. The
exact process varies by the part and can be involved, but it generally
involves the manufacturer paying a certified test lab to perform certain tests
and complying with various other filing requirements which include placing a
label on the device which specifies its FCC approval. Device manufacturers
must file with the FCC a description of how this label will appear before they
receive approval to market the device, which is why the rough designs of
unreleased devices are sometimes revealed by the rough drawings in these
filings---tech journalists will watch these to get the dimensions of new
iPhones, for example.</p>
<p>By the way, when I say the "FCC Regulations," if you want to follow along at
home these are promulgated as 47 CFR. So Part 27, for example, refers to 47 CFR
27. The ever lovely Cornell LII has the whole thing for your entertainment:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47. There's some reading for when you need
help falling asleep.</p>
<p>But that's all besides the point, I'm more interested in talking about
unintentional radiators, devices which are not intended to produce RF radiation
but may still do so as a result of the operation of the electronics---this is
generally called a spurious emission, which is basically any RF emitted by
accident. These devices are certified under Part 15 of the FCC regulations[1],
and so are sometimes called "Part 15 devices." Part 15 essentially limits the
type and amplitude of spurious emissions to prevent random devices causing
harmful interference due to defects in their designs.</p>
<p>What would we call a radio <em>receiver</em>, then? It is explicitly a radio device,
but is not intended to transmit anything. As a result, radio receivers are Part
15 devices. Most of Part 15 is very general and doesn't really say anything
specific about radio devices, it just limits spurious emissions and other
design standards. However, 15.121 gets a great deal more specific in
discussing "Scanning receivers.' A scanning receiver is specifically defined
earlier in the regulation as a device capable of tuning to two or more frequency
bands in the range of 30-960Mhz. This has the fun result that nothing for the
GHz range is technically a scanner, but for practical reasons this doesn't
matter too much.</p>
<p>So what's in 15.121? This is:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(a): ... scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or
marketed for use with scanning receivers, shall: (1) Be incapable of operating
(tuning), or readily being altered by the user to operate, within the frequency
bands allocated to the Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this
chapter (cellular telephone bands). ... (b) Be designed so that the tuning,
control and filtering circuitry is inaccessible. The design must be such that
any attempts to modify the equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular
Radiotelephone Service likely will render the receiver inoperable. </p>
<p>The rest of paragraph (a) gives a pretty long clarification of "readily being
altered by the user," and it's amusing to think of a bunch of FCC characters
sitting around a table trying to think up every alteration that is easy.
Jumper wires and reprogramming micro-controllers are both right out.</p>
<p>It gets even better:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(b): ... scanning receivers shall reject any signals from the
Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based
upon a 12 dB SINAD measurement, which is considered the threshold where a
signal can be clearly discerned from any interference that may be present. </p>
<p>So, here's this actual weird rule about scanners. Scanners are specifically
prohibited from being able to tune to any bands allocated to the Part 22
Cellular Radiotelephone Service. This raises questions, and as you can imagine
from the way I got here, I am about to spend a long time answering them.</p>
<p>When the FCC says "Cellular Radiotelephone Service," they aren't talking about
cell phones in general. The CRS as I'll call it refers to a <em>very specific</em>
cellular service, and that is AMPS.</p>
<p>AMPS, the Advanced Mobile Phone System, is the most common in the US of the
"1G" cellular services. Most carriers that were around when it was offered
called it "Analog" service, and indeed, AMPS was entirely analog. And, due to
an odd detail of the regulation, large cellular carriers were <em>required</em> to
offer AMPS service until 2008, long after AMPS phones were no longer produced.
You may have had a candy bar phone back when you would occasionally see an "A"
for analog service, but I hope not into the late 2000s.</p>
<p>There are a few things that we might infer from AMPS being an analog service.
One of those things is that it probably did not employ strong encryption. In
fact, AMPS employed no scrambling or enciphering of any kind. Your phone
conversations were just flapping in the wind for anyone to hear. This posed a
major practical problem for carriers in the '90s as it was discovered that it
was not particularly difficult to intercept the call setup process from an AMPS
phone and swipe its identification numbers, allowing you to basically steal
someone else's cellular service. You can imagine that this was popular with
certain criminals with a need for untraceable but convenient communications.</p>
<p>There was also a problem for consumers: their phone conversations could be
fairly easily overheard. There were a number of ways to do this, using any
radio scanner that covered that band for example. One particularly well-known
option was a particular model of phone, the Oki 900, that had an unusually
open design (in terms of modifiability) that led to reverse engineered and
modified firmware being developed that made eavesdropping on other people's
calls just, well, a feature it had.</p>
<p>The scale of this problem was fairly large, and it was fairly well known. For
example, let's turn to <em>my</em> favorite source of late-night reading, newspaper
archives. A lovely piece in the 30 May 1990 issue of The News and Observer,
from Raleigh NC, takes the cheesy headline "Monitoring Megahertz" and goes
into some depth on the issue.</p>
<p>"I've heard men call their wives and tell them they'll be home late, then call
their girl friends," quipped one electronics store owner who had "accidentally"
eavesdropped on cellular calls using a scanner. We've all fat-fingered our
ways into someone else's affairs I'm sure, pun intended. Another person said
"when you look at the fact that there are how many thousands of people out
there who know my name, my mailing address and my salary...I put cellular
eavesdropping down as being no different from that." In the face of technology,
even in 1990, people had begun to abandon their privacy.</p>
<p>Cellular carriers were not so happy about this, viewing it as an embarrassment
to their operation. I have heard before that cellular carriers went so far as
to lobby for banning scanners entirely, although I am not aware of much hard
evidence of this. What they did do was convince congress to stick an extra few
paragraphs onto an otherwise only tangentially related bit of legislation
called the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992. This has
largely to do with abusive 1-900 numbers, which is its whole own topic in
telephone regulation that I ought to take on sometime. But it also brought
along just a bit more, an extra section that was subsequently amended several
times at the behest of cellular carriers. Let's read part of it, as amended,
and with some editing for readability.</p>
<p>The Commission shall prescribe and make effective regulations denying equipment
authorization for any scanning receiver that is capable of---(A) receiving
transmissions in the frequencies allocated to the domestic cellular radio
telecommunications service, (B) readily being altered by the user to receive
transmissions in such frequencies, or (C) being equipped with decoders that
convert digital cellular transmissions to analog voice audio.</p>
<p>Well, we've made it full circle: we've seen the regulation, and we've seen the
legislation that kicked the FCC to write the regulation. But how does this
translate today? Things get a bit weird there.</p>
<p>You see, the FCC seems to have (sensibly) …</p></article></div>
