<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The consensus problem is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems which requires a group of processes (or agents) to reliably and timely agree on a single data value. Although extensively discussed in the context of distributed computing it’s not exclusive to this field, also being present in our society in a variety of situations such as in democratic elections, the legislative process, jury trial proceedings, and so forth.</p>

<p>It’s solved through the employment of a consensus protocol governing how processes (agents) interact with one another. It may seem redundant but, to solve the consensus problem, first all processes agree to follow the same consensus protocol.</p>

<p>Some of these processes may fail or be unreliable in other ways (such as in a conflict of interest situation) so consensus protocols must be fault tolerant or resilient. The processes must somehow propose their candidate values, communicate with one another, and decide on a single consensus value.</p>

<p>In this post I review four major consensus protocols for solving the consensus problem based on my implementation of them, namely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chandra–Toueg</li>
  <li>Ben-Or</li>
  <li>Basic Paxos</li>
  <li>Nakamoto Consensus</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find supporting code for this analysis in this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/TCGV/ConsensusKit">ConsensusKit</a></p>

<p>Before getting started let’s recap the three key properties of consensus protocols and take a quick look at relevant terminology for this discussion.</p>



<p>Formally a consensus protocol must satisfy the following three properties:</p>

<p><b>Termination</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Eventually, every correct process decides some value.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Integrity</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>If all the correct processes proposed the same value “v”, then any correct process must decide “v”.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Agreement</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Every correct process must agree on the same value.</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements are rather straight forward. “Termination” certifies the protocol is resilient to halting failures. “Agreement” deters any two correct processes from deciding on different values which would break consensus. Lastly “Integrity”, which is in fact flexible and may vary depending on application requirements, assures the protocol behaves in an expected and unbiased way.</p>



<p>These terms are used throughout this post as well within the provided support source code.</p>

<h4>Protocol</h4>

<p>The official set of rules (“algorithm”) governing the behavior of processes for solving the consensus problem.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>

<p>An individual agent belonging to a larger group of agents collectively interested in reaching consensus. Processes can be “correct”, meaning they strictly adhere to the protocol and are not subject to failures, or “faulty”, meaning we cannot rely on them following the protocol at all times.</p>

<h4>Instance</h4>

<p>A well-defined round of interactions among processes under a consensus protocol. Depending on the underlying protocol one or multiple intances are required for reaching consensus.</p>

<h4>Proposer</h4>

<p>A process role. Processes under this role are entitled for proposing values. Any value agreed upon by all correct processes must have originated in a proposer.</p>

<h4>Decider</h4>

<p>A process role. Processes under this role are entitled for deciding on a value. Any value agreed upon by all correct processes must have been voted by at least one decider.</p>

<h4>Archiver</h4>

<p>An application or a subsystem that is responsible for persisting decided values and implementing a protocol’s specific data constraints.</p>

<h4>Failure detector</h4>

<p>An application or a subsystem that is responsible for the detection of node failures or crashes.</p>

<h4>Majority</h4>

<p>A protocol’s specific threshold requiring at least half of available votes, more when faulty processes are taken into account.</p>

<h4>Quorum</h4>

<p>A protocol’s specific threshold which ensures that a minimum number of participants (or votes) is met for taking an action.</p>

<p>With these definitions in place let’s move on to the implementation and review of each consensus protocol.</p>



<p>My main goal has been to implement these four protocols in code to be able to run and evaluate them in a controlled environment. I was also interested in trying to spot structural similarities among them that could be extracted into a common base structure, promoting code reuse.</p>

<p>The result of my first coding iteration is displayed in the simplified class diagram below:</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://thomasvilhena.com/images/p22/main-classes.PNG" alt="Main Clasees">
</p>

<p>Three main classes are depicted in the diagram:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <b>Procotol</b> class has a collection of processes that will interact among each other according to the protocol rules for reaching consensus. Each execution of the protocol, through the <code>Execute</code> method, creates a new Instance (not to be confused with the conventional meaning of “instance” in object oriented programming).</li>
  <li>The <b>Instance</b> class represents one round of interactions among processes potentially resulting in a consensus, as indicated by the <code>Consensus</code> and <code>Value</code> properties. It’s responsible for managing the interaction between processes exercicing proposer and/or decider roles, providing methods for message delivery (<code>Send</code>) and retrieval (<code>WaitMessage</code> and <code>WaitQuorum</code>).</li>
  <li>The <b>Process</b> class is responsible for implementing proposer and/or decider roles. Behavior is defined in the <code>Bind</code> method just before the instance starts since, as well see, some protocols require processes to play different roles according the the current instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Process.Propose</code> virtual method is called at the start of an instance execution for all proposer processes in that instance to kick off communication and has the following default implementation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>protected</span> <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>Propose</span><span>(</span><span>Instance</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>Proposer</span><span>.</span><span>GetProposal</span><span>();</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>Archiver</span><span>.</span><span>CanCommit</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>))</span>
        <span>Broadcast</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Propose</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It first generates a proposal based on the underlying proposer logic (ex: random boolean proposer), then verifies against an archiver if the generated value passes custom application requirements and finally broadcasts it to all sibling processes.</p>

<p>Processes that bind to the <code>Instance.WaitQuorum</code> event will wait for the protocol specific amount of messages (for each message type) required for taking an action. The specific amounts are defined in each protocol implementation when deriving the Instance class.</p>

<p>All four consensus protocols were implemented using this base structure, as presented in the following sections. Rather than performing an extensive code analysis I will focus on presenting each theoretical algorithm and key points of my implementation.</p>



<p>The Chandra–Toueg consensus algorithm was first published by Tushar Deepak Chandra and Sam Toueg in 1996 and introduced the concept of failure detectors as means for solving the consensus problem. The algorithm assumes a number of faulty processes denoted by <b>f</b> that’s less than <b>n/2</b> (i.e. less than simple majority).</p>

<p>In each instance one process acts as the decider (rotating coordinator) and all other processes act as proposers. The actions carried out in each instance are<sup>1</sup>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All processes send (r, preference, timestamp) to the coordinator.</li>
  <li>The coordinator waits to receive messages from at least half of the processes (including itself).
    <ol>
      <li>It then chooses as its preference a value with the most recent timestamp among those sent.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The coordinator sends (r, preference) to all processes.</li>
  <li>Each process waits (1) to receive (r, preference) from the coordinator, or (2) for its failure detector to identify the coordinator as crashed.
    <ol>
      <li>In the first case, it sets its own preference to the coordinator’s preference and responds with ack(r).</li>
      <li>In the second case, it sends nack(r) to the coordinator.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The coordinator waits to receive ack(r) or nack(r) from a majority of processes.
    <ol>
      <li>If it receives ack(r) from a majority, it sends decide(preference) to all processes.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Any process that receives decide(preference) for the first time relays decide(preference) to all processes, then decides preference and terminates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at the code. The following code snippet defines the proposer process behavior:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>BindAsProposer</span><span>(</span><span>Instance</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>msgs</span><span>.</span><span>Single</span><span>();</span>
        <span>SendTo</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Source</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Ack</span><span>,</span> <span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Decide</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>msgs</span><span>.</span><span>Single</span><span>().</span><span>Value</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Terminate</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On instance start proposers broadcast their values. Then they wait for a quorum to select a value from the pool of proposals. Since the protocol defines only a single decider per round this quorum is met when the decider process broadcasts his selection. Upon receiving this selection the proposer node will acknowledge it and wait for the decider’s decision, and then decide on the same value and terminate execution.</p>

<p>Now let’s see the code defining the complementary decider processes behavior:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>private</span> <span>void</span> <span>BindAsCoordinator</span><span>(</span><span>Instance</span> <span>r</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Propose</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>PickMostRecentValue</span><span>(</span>
            <span>msgs</span><span>.</span><span>Where</span><span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Archiver</span><span>.</span><span>CanCommit</span><span>(</span><span>m</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>))</span>
        <span>);</span>

        <span>Broadcast</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Select</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>WaitQuorum</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Ack</span><span>,</span> <span>msgs</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>PickMostRecentValue</span><span>(</span><span>msgs</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Broadcast</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageType</span><span>.</span><span>Decide</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Terminate</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It first waits for a quorum of proposals, i.e, for a simple majority of proposers to submit their values. Then the decider picks the most recent message value, possibly validating the value with the archiver, and broadcasts the selected value back to all processes.</p>

<p>After broadcasting the selected value the decider waits for a quorum of proposers to acknowledge it, in which case it decides on that value and broadcasts its decision to all processes before terminating.</p>

<p>Notice that this simplified implementation doesn’t take failures into account, even though the Chandra–Toueg protocol is fault-resilient.</p>



<p>Ben-Or is a decentralized consensus protocol, i.e., it doesn’t assign the decider role to any specific process. Curiously the algorithm correctness proof was only provided in a paper 15 years after its original publication<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>Because it lacks a decider for solving tie-break …</p></div></div>

                    On 24 August, the Storting (Norwegian parliament) disclosed that its email systems had been hacked. ‘This is a very serious incident, affecting our most important democratic institution. The security and intelligence services are cooperating closely to deal with this matter at the national level. Based on the information the Government has, it is our view that Russia is responsible for these activities,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Ine Eriksen Søreide.

<p>The incident management is coordinated through the Norwegian Joint Cyber Coordination Centre.</p>
<p>This incident demonstrates the importance of good security measures. The increasing use of digital solutions means that the threats against us have also shifted to the digital arena. The Government will continue its efforts to strengthen national cyber security and expand international cooperation in this field.</p>
<p>Businesses, organisations, and private individuals must all participate in preventive security efforts if we are to prevent breaches of digital security. All types of organisations are advised to follow the recommendations of the Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) regarding passwords and the basic guidelines for ICT security.</p>

I hope that this will help to fix some issues you might currently have on your awesome blog or portfolio without even being aware of them, kick-off your audience growth, and get discovered online 🚀.</p><section id="why-seo-is-so-important-section"><h2 id="why-seo-is-so-important"><a href="#why-seo-is-so-important" aria-label="why seo is so important permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>Why SEO is so important?</h2><p>You might know very little about what SEO does behind the scenes. To me, at least, it looked like an obscure, inconsistent, pseudo-science that only marketing people could understand (spoiler alert, it still kind of is).
However, after getting <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent">@monicalent</a>'s awesome course <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/">bloggingfordevs</a>, it made the inner workings and good practices related to SEO a bit clearer to me. To quote her from her first newsletter</p><blockquote><p>SEO is a way of making sure that search engines can understand what your page is about, that it contains quality up-to-date information from an authoritative source, and will answer the question that the searcher had in mind.</p></blockquote><p>With good SEO, search engines can know what your content is about, discover all the blog posts you've written and, if you're lucky, catapult you to the top search result for a given set of keywords. Moreover, where <strong>sharing my newest articles on Twitter and Reddit would just cause a spike in traffic for a few days</strong>, <strong>SEO helps you get a more consistent traffic</strong> on your website, and for a longer time. The latter is what I was lacking for the longest time, despite having set up my Gatsby website and SEO component properly (or at least I thought so).</p><p>Gatsby's documentation has an incredibly well-written section on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/seo-and-social-sharing-cards-tutorial/">how to build an SEO component</a> to help you get started. However, that alone wasn't enough to make my blog discoverable early on, as you can see in the chart below representing the number of daily impressions I got since starting this blog:</p><figcaption>Chart representing the number of impressions per day of this blog on Google Search from August 2019 to the October 2020 (hover to see the data)</figcaption><p>For most of its first year, my blog was getting less than 50 daily impressions. <strong>Today</strong>, after fixing the issues I'm about to talk about, <strong>I get over 1000 daily impressions and it's still growing!</strong>
Of course, SEO is not the only component here, I also created more content this year and choose a better way to promote them, but it is still a significant driver to the growth you can see above.</p></section><section id="trailing-slashes-chaos-section"><h2 id="trailing-slashes-chaos"><a href="#trailing-slashes-chaos" aria-label="trailing slashes chaos permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>Trailing slashes chaos</h2><p>The blog you're reading this article on is built with Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. Sadly, using these two tools together without taking care of inconsistent trailing slash <code>/</code> at the end of your URLs can result in some undesirable outcomes.</p><p>One of these outcomes was that I was seeing a lot of <code>301</code> redirects logged in my analytics as readers were navigating to my articles. On my blog, a link to one of my blog posts would typically look like this: <code>/posts/learning-in-public</code> but when a reader clicked on it Netlify would append a trailing slash at the end of it thus redirecting the user.</p><p>That, my friends, is extremely bad for SEO. It impacted several unrelated areas of my website, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Opengraph images or Twitter cards not being rendered consistently</strong>: readers would share a link sometimes with or without the trailing slash which would make it hard for some services to get the proper metadata and thus render a simple link instead of a proper preview card.</li><li><strong>Invalid URLs in sitemap</strong>: my sitemap is generated automatically at build time with a Gatsby plugin based on the URLs and pages of my website. Since I did not have trailing slashes at the end of my URLs it would generate my sitemap without them which once uploaded to Google Search Console would result in tons of warnings about invalid URLs since Google referenced the ones with the trailing slashes.</li></ul><section><h3 id="how-i-fixed-this"><a href="#how-i-fixed-this" aria-label="how i fixed this permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>How I fixed this</h3><p>I could have fixed this in two different ways:</p><ol><li>Disable the "Pretty URLs" option in Netlify's asset optimization settings.

  </figure><p>As Google already referenced my blog posts with a trailing slash, I decided to go with option number 2.</p><p>That change might look insignificant, but it resulted in a lot of weird issues suddenly disappearing. Additionally, it was essential for me to fix this before addressing the issue I'm just about to start talking about 😄!</p></section></section><section id="canonical-links-section"><h2 id="canonical-links"><a href="#canonical-links" aria-label="canonical links permalink"><svg style="width:0px;height:0px"></svg></a>Canonical links</h2><p>If you've been following me for a while, you might have started reading my content on <a href="https://medium.com/@MaximeHeckel">Medium</a>. I started blog.maximeheckel.com just about a year ago as of the time I'm writing these words. All the content on this site that dates back to before August 2019, was originally published on Medium.</p><p>On top of that, I did not edit the articles when migrating them to this website, nor did I delete the Medium ones. This resulted in <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/duplicate-content">duplicated content</a>, which meant that my newly deployed blog was in competition with Medium on the same keyword, the same content, from the same author when it comes to ranking on Google.</p><p>Thankfully there's a way to avoid this: <strong>setting canonical URLs</strong>. These URLs are placed in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your blog posts source code and designate that this post is the "original" post with that given content.</p><p>There are 2 steps to add valid canonical URLs to your website:</p><ol><li>You need to add them to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your post. For example: <code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/learning-in-public/" /&gt;</code></li><li>Head over to any third party platform you used in the past that has the content and add this canonical URL into the setting page of your post. I followed <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033930293-Set-a-canonical-link">this guide</a> on Medium to update my old blog post.</li></ol><p>Of course, you cannot do the first step until you've fixed any potential trailing slashes issues you may have like the ones I shared just above.</p><div><p>If like me you're a Gatsby user, you might be tempted to use <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-canonical-urls/">gatsby-plugin-canonical-urls</a> which adds canonical URLs to your site's HTML pages at build time. </p><p><strong>I do not recommend this plugin</strong> for complex setups.</p><p>I tried it and it would consistently fail to put the proper URL, especially since my website as offline support it would sometimes write the offline fallback url in the <code>&lt;head/&gt;</code> of my HTML pages.
You'll be safer to add your canonical links programmatically in your own SEO component. See the code snippet below for an example. </p></div><div><div><p data-testid="codesnippet-title">Simplied version of the SEO component I built with support for canonical URLs</p></div><pre

                            <p>RICHMOND, Va. — A Virginia judge has granted a request to extend voter registration for 48 hours following technical issues that caused the commonwealth's voter registration portal to shut down for hours on Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>U.S. District Judge John A. Gibney, Jr. in Richmond gave the order Wednesday. The shutdown of the state’s website caused “a tremendous harm” to the people who want to register to vote, Gibney said.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>The deadline to register to vote is now 11:59 p.m. on Thursday Oct. 15. It includes both online and in-person registration.</p>
                    <p>“Today’s agreement to extend the voter registration deadline is a big win for democracy. Any eligible Virginian who was not able to register to vote yesterday can now do so,” said Attorney General Herring<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>“I have made it a top priority over the last several months to protect Virginians’ right to vote by making it as easy, safe and secure as possible, and this agreement is no different. I will continue to fight to make sure that every eligible Virginian can vote in this crucial election and that their vote will count.”</p>

                    <p>An accidentally cut cable caused the entire Virginia voter registration system to go down for hours on the last day to register to vote before election day, according to the Virginia Information Technology Agency (VITA). Just before 3:30 p.m., the Virginia Department of Elections tweeted out that the <a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registration portal</a> was back up and functioning properly.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Virginians are once again able to register to vote online with identification, or in-person at their voter registrar's offices.</p>
                    <p>VITA &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/vaELECT/status/1316012911031017482?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted that a fiber cut</a> near Route 10 in Chester, Virginia was to blame for Tuesday's outage.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"Technicians learned that a Verizon fiber had been inadvertently struck as part of activities related to a Chesterfield County roadside utilities project, located off of Route 10 in Chester, Virginia," VITA said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>There was no time estimate given on when the problem would be fixed.</p>
                    <p>"Due to a network outage, the Citizen Portal is temporarily unavailable," the Virginia Department of Elections posted on their registration website Tuesday morning. "We are working with our network providers to restore service as quickly as possible."&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those just joining us, news broke last week about the jailbreaking of <a href="https://www.apple.com/euro/mac/shared/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Apple’s T2 security processor in recent Macs</a>. If you haven't read it yet, <a href="https://blog.t8012.dev/on-bridgeos-t2-research/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">you can catch up on the story here</a>, and try this out yourself at home <a href="https://checkra.in/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">using the latest build of checkra1n</a>. So far we’ve stated that you must put the computer into DFU before you can run checkra1n to jailbreak the T2 and that remains true, however today we are introducing a demo of replacing a target Mac's EFI and releasing details on the T2 debug interface.</p><p>In order to build their products unlike app developers Apple has to debug the core operating system. This is how firmware, the kernel and the debugger itself are built and debugged. From the earliest days of the iPod, Apple has built specialized debug probes for building their products. <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/03/08/iphone-hack-what-dev-fused-iphones-are-and-why-theyre-important/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">These devices are leaked</a> from Apple headquarters and their factories and have traditionally had monkey related names such as the “<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Kong_Cable" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Kong</a>”, “<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Kanzi_Cable" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Kanzi</a>” and “<a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Chimp_Cable" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Chimp</a>”. They work by allowing access to special debug pins of the CPU, (which for <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">ARM devices is called Serial Wire Debug</a> or SWD), as well as other chips via JTAG and UART. <a href="https://blog.senr.io/blog/jtag-explained" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">JTAG is a powerful protocol</a> allowing direct access to the components of a device and access generally provides the ability to circumvent most security measures. Apple has even spoken about their debug capabilities <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Krstic.pdf" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">in a BlackHat talk</a> describing the security measures in effect. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/31/internal-usb-c-diagnostic-tool/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">even deployed versions of these</a> to their retail locations allowing for repair of their iPads and Macs.</p><h2 id="the-bonobo-in-the-myst">The Bonobo in the Myst</h2><p>Another hardware hacker and security researcher <a href="http://ramtin-amin.fr/#tristar" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Ramtin Amin did work last year</a> to create an effective <a href="https://shop.lambdaconcept.com/home/37-bonobo-debug-cable.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">clone of the Kanzi cable</a>. This combined with the checkm8 vulnerability from <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mX" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">axi0mX</a> allows iPhones 5s - X to be debugged. </p><p>One of the interesting questions is how does the Macs <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-2/revive-or-restore-mac-firmware-apdebea5be51/mac" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">share a USB port </a>with both the Intel CPU (macOS) and the T2 (bridgeOS) for DFU. &nbsp;These are essentially separate computers inside of the case sharing the same pins. &nbsp;Schematics of the MacBook leaked from Apple’s vendors (a quick search with a part number and “schematic”), and analysis of the USB-C firmware update payload show that there is a component on each port which is tasked with both multiplexing (allowing the port to be shared) as well as terminating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#PD" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">USB power delivery (USB-PD)</a> for the charging of the MacBook or connected devices. &nbsp;Further analysis shows that this port is shared between the following:<br></p><ul><li>The Thunderbolt controller which allows the port to be used by macOS as Thunderbolt, USB3 or DisplayPort</li><li>The T2 USB host for DFU recovery</li><li>Various UART serial lines</li><li>The debug pins of the T2</li><li>The debug pins of the Intel CPU for debugging EFI and the kernel of macOS</li></ul><p><br>Like the above documentation related to the iPhone, the debug lanes of a Mac are only available if enabled via the T2. &nbsp;Prior to the checkm8 bug this required a specially signed payload from Apple, meaning that Apple has a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11031902/apple-encryption-fbi-san-bernardino-backdoor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">skeleton key to debug any device</a> including production machines. &nbsp;Thanks to checkm8, any T2 can be demoted, and the debug functionality can be enabled. &nbsp;Unfortunately Intel has placed large amounts of <a href="https://thunderbolttechnology.net/developer-application">information about the Thunderbolt controllers</a> and <strong>protocol under NDA</strong>, meaning that it has not been properly researched leading to a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/thunderstrike-mac-osx-bootkit/7164/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">string</a> of <a

&nbsp;The USB-C port specification provides pins for this exact purpose (CC1/CC2) as well as detecting the orientation of the cable allowing for it to be reversible. &nbsp;On top of the CC pins runs another low speed protocol called USB-PD or USB power delivery. &nbsp;It is primarily used to negotiate power requirements between chargers(sources) and devices (sinks). &nbsp;USB-PD also allows for arbitrary packets of information in what are called “Vendor Defined Messages” or VDMs.</p><h2 id="apple-s-usb-pd-extensions">Apple’s USB-PD Extensions</h2><p>The VDM allows Apple to trigger actions and specify the target of a USB-C connection. &nbsp;We have discovered USB-PD payloads that <strong>cause the T2 to be rebooted and for the T2 to be held into a DFU state</strong>. &nbsp;Putting these two actions together, we can cause the T2 to restart ready to be jailbroken by checkra1n without any user interaction. &nbsp;While we haven’t tested a Apple Serial Number Reader, we suspect it works in a similar fashion, allowing the devices ECID and Serial Number to be read from the T2’s DFU reliably. &nbsp;The Mac also speaks USB-PD to other devices, such as when an iPad Pro is connected in DFU mode. &nbsp;<br><strong>Apple needs to document the entire set of VDM messages</strong> used in their products so that consumers can understand the security risks. &nbsp;The set of commands we issue are unauthenticated, and even if they were they were undocumented and thus un-reviewed. &nbsp;<strong>Apple could have prevented this scenario</strong> by requiring that some physical attestation occurs during these VDMs such as holding down the power button at the same time.</p><p>Taking all this information into account, we can string it together to reflect a real world attack. &nbsp;By creating a specialized device <strong>about the size of a power charger</strong>, we can place a T2 into DFU mode, run checkra1n, replace the EFI and upload a key logger to capture all keys. &nbsp;This is possible even though macOS is un-altered (the logo at boot is for effect but need not be done). &nbsp;This is because in Mac portables <strong>the keyboard is directly connected to the T2</strong> and passed through to macOS.</p><p>PlugNPwn is the entry into DFU directly from connecting a cable to the DFU port (if it doesn't show, it may be your AdBlock: <a

    <p>In my job as a scientific software developer, I tend to write a lot of code. And most people who haven’t been through a Computer Science degree tend to think that CS is “just” about slinging code at the screen and then running it. I have a good working relationship with many of my colleagues and co-workers with other backgrounds… Physics, Climate Science, Biology, etc. But when it comes to developing software, I get the distinct impression that people think, “Hey, how hard could this be?! We just write down a few instructions about what we want the computer to do, hit the execute button and the, ‘Blamo!’, we get our answer!”</p>

<p>The problem with that line of thinking is that it’s incredibly easy to write instructions that don’t mean what you think they mean. For example, your program could be completely uninterpretable by the computer. Furthermore, there is literally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">no way to tell whether your program will ever actually terminate</a> without actually executing it. And there are many, many, <em>many</em>, ways to write a program which make it “slow” to execute. “Slow” being… like <em>really</em> slow. Like it would take your entire lifetime or more to actually execute it. This final problem is one that I see most often when reading software written by people without a CS education. And fixing that is my job.</p>

<p>The thing about CS that people don’t realize is that it teaches you about the theory of computation, computability (i.e. can we actually compute something? We often take for granted that we can!), algorithm complexity, and all of the knowledge, logic and analysis techniques and help you compose a program that will run in the minimum amount of time or using the minimum amount of space.</p>

<p>Allow me to show you an example of a huge optimization that I made to a simple script written by a colleague.</p>

<p>In climate science we do a lot of downscaling. We take temperature and precipitation readings from a coarse scale Global Climate Model grid and map them to a fine scale local grid. Let’s say the global grid is 50x25 and the local grid is 1000x500. For each grid cell in the local grid, we want to know to which grid cell in the global grid it corresponds.</p>

<p>A simple way to think about this is that we want to minimize the distance between L[n] and G[n]. So a simple way to do the search would be:</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:
  for each Global cell G[j]:
     compute distance between L[i] and G[j]
  find the minimum distance in the set L[i] * G
  return the index of the minimum
</code></pre>

<p>It seems simple enough. However, if you look closely, you’ll notice that you have to do a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Look at the algorithm in terms of the size of the input.</p>

<pre><code>for each Local cell L[i]:                        # Do this L times
  for each Global cell G[j]:                     # Do this L x G times
     compute distance (d) between L[i] and G[j]  # Do this L x G times
  find the minimum distance in the set d[i*j]    # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
  find the index whose cell matches the minimum  # Read G cells L times (cost L x G)
</code></pre>

<p>The code for this looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>obs.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lon')
obs.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.obs, 'lat')
n.lon &lt;- length(obs.lon)
n.lat &lt;- length(obs.lat)

obs.lats &lt;- matrix(obs.lat, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat, byrow=TRUE)
obs.lons &lt;- matrix(obs.lon, nrow=n.lon, ncol=n.lat)
obs.time &lt;- netcdf.calendar(nc.obs)

gcm.lon &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lon')-360
gcm.lat &lt;- ncvar_get(nc.gcm, 'lat')
gcm.lats &lt;- matrix(gcm.lat, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon),
                   byrow=TRUE)
gcm.lons &lt;- matrix(gcm.lon, ncol=length(gcm.lat), nrow=length(gcm.lon))
gcm.lons.lats &lt;- cbind(c(gcm.lons), c(gcm.lats))

# Figure out which GCM grid boxes are associated with each fine-scale grid point
# Confine search to 10 deg. x 10 deg. neighbourhood

dxy &lt;- 10
mdist &lt;- function(x, y)
    apply(abs(sweep(data.matrix(y), 2, data.matrix(x), '-')), 1, sum)
nn &lt;- list()
for (i in seq_along(obs.lons)) {
    if((i %% 500)==0) cat(i, '')
    gcm.lims &lt;- ((gcm.lons.lats[,1] &gt;= (obs.lons[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,1] &lt;= (obs.lons[i]+dxy))) &amp;
                ((gcm.lons.lats[,2] &gt;= (obs.lats[i]-dxy)) &amp;
                 (gcm.lons.lats[,2] &lt;= (obs.lats[i]+dxy)))
    gcm.lims &lt;- which(gcm.lims)
    nn.min &lt;- which.min(mdist(c(obs.lons[i], obs.lats[i]),
                        gcm.lons.lats[gcm.lims,]))
    nn[[i]] &lt;- gcm.lims[nn.min]
}
nn &lt;- unlist(nn)
</code></pre>

<p>So, it seems like a simple algorithm. “Just” compute the distances and then find the minimum. But the way it was written, as the size of the number of local cells grows, our cost of computation grows by its product with the number of global grid cells. For Canadian ANUSPLIN data, there are 1068 x 510 cells (for a total of 544,680) and let’s say that our GCM has 50 x 25 cells (for a total of 1,250 cells). So the cost of the inner loop in “some computational unit” is:</p>



<p>where the  terms are constants that correspond to the cost of computing a distance between two points, finding the minimum point, and finding an array index. Really, we don’t care (much) about the constant terms, because they are not affected by the size of the input. So we can just clump them together and call the cost;</p>



<p>So for this set of input, our cost is </p>

<p>680 million.</p>

<p>That <em>seems</em> like a lot, but is it? Computers are fast, right? If we run the naive implementation that’s something like this:</p>

<p>it ends up taking 1668 seconds which is a little less than half an hour.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; source('BCCA/naive.implementation.R')
500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 ... 543000 543500 544000 544500 [1] "Elapsed Time"
    user   system  elapsed 
1668.868    8.926 1681.728 
</code></pre>

<p>But do we <em>need</em> for it to take 30 minutes? Here’s the thing. We’re comparing two grids together, both of which have tons of structure that we haven’t taken advantage of. For example the latitudes and longitudes in both the coarse and the fine grid are in sorted order. So if you want to search for a number, you don’t have to look at every single number. You can use a bisect algorithm where you look at the point in the middle and then decide which half of the array you want to search. Then searching the full space only costs you the log (base 2) of the search space.</p>

<p>The other major structure that we haven’t taken advantage of is the fact that the latitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension and the longitudes repeat themselves in the  dimension. So instead of doing an operation  times, we can do it  times. That’s a <em>huge</em> optimization.</p>

<p>What does that look like in pseudo-code?</p>

<pre><code>For each local[x]:
    bisect_search(local[x], Global[x])

For each local[y]:
    bisect_search(local[y], Global[y])

return a 2d grid of the search results for each dimension
</code></pre>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code>## Perform a binary search on the *sorted* vector v
## Return the array index of the element closest to x
find.nearest &lt;- function(x, v) {
    if (length(v) == 1) {
        return(1)
    }
    if (length(v) == 2) {
        return(which.min(abs(v - x)))
    }
    mid &lt;- ceiling(length(v) / 2)
    if (x == v[mid]) {
        return(mid)
    } else if (x &lt; v[mid]) {
        return(find.nearest(x, v[1:mid]))
    }
    else {
        return((mid - 1) + find.nearest(x, v[mid:length(v)]))
    }
}

regrid.one.dim &lt;- function(coarse.points, fine.points) {
    return(sapply(fine.points, find.nearest, coarse.points))
}

## Take a fine scale (e.g. ANUSPLINE) grid of latitudes and longitudes
## and find the indicies that correspond to a coarse scale (e.g. a GCM) grid
## Since the search is essentially a minimizing distance in 2 dimensions
## We can actually search independently in each dimensions separately (which
## is a huge optimization, making the run time x + y instead of x * y) and
## then reconstruct the indices to create a full grid
regrid.coarse.to.fine &lt;- function(coarse.lats, coarse.lons, fine.lats, fine.lons) {
    xi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lon, obs.lon)
    yi &lt;- regrid.one.dim(gcm.lat, obs.lat)
    ## Two dimensional grid of indices
    xi &lt;- matrix(xi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=F)
    yi &lt;- matrix(yi, ncol=length(fine.lats), nrow=length(fine.lons), byrow=T)
    return(list(xi=xi, yi=yi))
}

</code></pre>

<p>The cost for every bisection search is the log of the input size. Our input size is divided into X and Y space this time, so we’ll use , and  for Global, Local, X and Y.</p>



<p>Plugging in our numbers this gives us a cost estimate of 553,076. 553 thousand sounds a lot better than 680 million. Do we see that in the run time?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ptm &lt;- proc.time(); rv &lt;- regrid.coarse.to.fine(gcm.lat, gcm.lon, obs.lat, obs.lon); print('Elapsed Time'); print(proc.time() - ptm)[1] "Elapsed Time"
   user  system elapsed 
  0.117   0.000   0.117 
&gt; str(rv)
List of 2
 $ xi: num [1:1068, 1:510] 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 ...
 $ yi: num [1:1068, 1:510] 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 ...
&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>0.117 seconds. What took us almost half an hour before, now takes us a little over  of a second.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; 1668.868 / .117
[1] 14263.83
</code></pre>

<p>Soooooo… I know that I’m trained to do this kind of work and it’s my job to know how to do these types of things. But even <em>I’m</em> surprised and self-impressed at how significant that speedup is. That’s a <em>14 thousand times</em> speedup.</p>

<p>This script used to take so long that it had to save its output to disk and be manually checked by a scientist before proceeding. Now you can compute it in the blink of an eye. This is a computation that we have to do hundreds of times, and this saves us days to weeks of computation time. And it increases the ability to interact with the system, helping us to get more value out of our scientists’ time… they’re not sitting around waiting for a computation to finish. It just does it.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that these epic performance improvements come without buying any larger computer systems, no parallelization or increase in complexity… in fact the code for the faster algorithm is actually simpler and more reusable! It’s pretty much an all around win, just by reading the code and having …</p></div></div>

almost unnoticeably to you. In this lesson, we’ll build a network client application, which does something similar to
your browser in this situation.</p><p>It all starts with an <em>address</em>: you want to send a message to your friend Alice, but your computer needs to know
<em>where</em> these messages should be sent for the message to be delivered to the right computer—just like you need to
provide a recipient address when you send an email.</p><p>We are used to one kind of address system: <em>domain names</em>, like <code>lowlvl.org</code> or <code>duckduckgo.com</code>. However, these
addresses are intended to be used by human beings; machines use another addressing system.
Internet protocol (or <em>IP</em>) addresses look like <code>192.168.0.1</code>. In order to find out which IP address we should use
for a domain name like <code>lowlvl.org</code>, we ask a <em>name server</em>, a computer with a well-known IP address like
<code>1.2.3.4</code>. A name server understands DNS, or the domain name service <em>protocol</em>. Protocols are languages in
which computers can talk to each other.</p><p>So why don't we give it a try? Let's translate a domain name into an IP address:</p><p>Below you see a code example written in Rust (if you are not familiar with the Rust syntax, you can refer to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Book</a> and learn by example).</p><p>This should give you a taste of what it's like to work with computer networks. Now let's start looking into
what makes this code tick!</p></div></div><div><div><p>We have now seen how IP addresses are used in a small, imaginary network of two computers.
But just knowing an address isn’t enough to do something useful: machines need to follow a well-known
protocol to make sure they can communicate with each other in a predictable way. This is what the
Internet protocol suite, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a>,
is about: it's a standard collection of protocols used on the Internet.</p><p>The protocol suite consists of several protocols, of which we are interested in two: IP and UDP (later
we will also cover TCP and other protocols).</p><p>​<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> is the bread and butter of networking.
It serves as a foundation for high-level protocols. When computers exchange
messages, they encode them into IP <em>packets</em>, which you can view as individual
message units of up to 65 kilobytes in size. Usually, the operating system takes
care of the encoding for us and we don't need to do it manually, but it's still
good to know how it works under the hood, so let's see what a typical IP packet
looks like:</p><p>When you run this code, you see the destructured IP packet in a table. Each table cell contains an
individial field of the packet header. The header fields we set in code are highlighted in green—we
can skip the rest of them, for now.</p><p>On the right side, you can see the exact same packet represented in the
<em>hexadecimal</em> numerical system which is often used
to represent bytes because of its compactness (each single byte can be encoded by a hexadecimal
number ranging from <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code>, which <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=0xFF+in+decimal&amp;t=hk&amp;ia=answer">corresponds to decimal</a>
<code>0</code> to <code>255</code>). This demonstrates that the IP header is just a sequence of numbers that we can interpret
and represent in different ways. If you are not comfortable with hexadecimal numbers, you can refer to
the <a href="https://lowlvl.org/prerequisites/binary-and-hexadecimal-numbers">prerequisite lesson on number encoding</a>.</p><h2>User Datagram Protocol</h2><p>​<abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>, or User Datagram Protocol, is a
thin layer above IP which adds some more contextual information for a message. A
UDP <abbr title="a word combination of data + telegram">datagram</abbr>
is also divided into a header and a payload. The fun thing about it is that an
entire UDP datagram is the <em>payload</em> of an IP packet! This is called
<em>encapsulation</em> and it's one of the core ideas in networking. A single layer of
the network stack like IP doesn’t know and doesn’t care about its payload, which
can be a protocol from the Internet protocol suite like TCP and UDP or even a
protocol defined by you.</p><p>UDP headers are only 8 bytes long. They contain source and destination <em>port numbers</em> which help to identify
different services running on the same computer—it's very common for a server to have many functions. Usually,
we designate a specific port number for a given service by convention. For example, name servers commonly use
the port number 53.</p><p>A UDP header also includes the total size of a datagram in bytes and a <em>checksum</em> which is used to verify
that the original network packet is not corrupted during transmission. And that's all it adds to the IP header!</p><p>Let's construct a UDP datagram header and add it to the previous example:</p><p>Now we are ready to move onto sending messages we have constructed
over the network!</p></div></div><div><div><p>Now we know how UDP datagrams and IP packets are constructed, but we
don't have to do this ourselves all the time. Instead, we can use
tools and functions provided by the operating system and the
standard library of our programming language. In Rust, these
functions are part of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/index.html"><code>std::net</code></a>
module.</p><p>We can use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.bind"><code>UdpSocket::bind</code></a>
function to construct <em>sockets</em>, which are virtual files that associate your program with a given port number.

to construct UDP datagrams from a given payload and send them over the network. We can wait for a response by using
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.recv_from"><code>UdpSocket::recv_from</code></a>
function, which returns an IP address and a port number of a sender along with the message payload. In the case of
the name server request, we can interpret the payload as an IP address. If we send a request for Alice’s address to
the name server, we should get it back in this response!</p><p>Let's give it a try:</p><p>When you run this code, you can find a list of all IP packets you send and receive on the right. You can browse the
contents of IP packet headers and UDP datagrams. You can also find contents of an original message represented in
hexadecimal format below the packet browser.</p><p>With everything we have learned, you should be ready for a final test. In this test, you need to send a message to
your friend Alice. You know that she uses the port number <code>1000</code>—but you don't know her IP address yet! Maybe the
name server can help?</p><p>Congratulations, you have finished this lesson!</p><p>In the next one, we will cover the topic of fragmentation. So far we have been dealing with small messages only,

large messages into small parts and how to reconstruct original files in the next lesson.</p><p><span>If you would like to follow updates, you can<!-- --> <a href="https://eepurl.com/haHQUn">subscribe to our mailing list</a>.</span></p></div></div><div><div id="lesson-navigation"><ol><li data-step="1">Exchanging Messages</li><li data-step="2">Sockets and Datagrams</li><li data-step="3">Sockets API</li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <p>In short, effective methods to come up with product ideas can be categorized along two dimensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Organic ↔ Inorganic</a>. While organic ideas are solutions to problems you noticed in your own life, inorganic ideas are related to other people’s problems. Formulated differently, organic ideas grow out of the founders’ own experiences, while inorganic ideas don’t.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1243820706116198403">Bottom-up ↔ Top-down</a>. When you start only with a category in mind, you’re following a top-down approach, while if your ideation efforts start at some smaller scale you’re doing bottom-up ideation.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll discuss these distinctions in much more tangible terms in a moment. But first, just one more high-level observation. With the two dimensions at hand, we’re left with four distinct categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organic, Bottom-Up Ideation. (“Scratch your own itch”)</li>
  <li>Organic, Top-Down Ideation. (“Live in the future, then build what’s missing”)</li>
  <li>Inorganic, Bottom-Up Ideation. (“Idea extraction”)</li>
  <li>Inorganic, Top-Up Ideation. (“Idea safaris”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Different entrepreneurs swear by different ideation methods. But what they all have in common is that they focus on finding problems over ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Customers don’t pay for ideas; they pay for their problems to be solved.” - Nathan Barry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Focusing on ideas is dangerous because it often leads to clever products that no one wants.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/gut.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>My humble opinion is that you should try all ideation methods at least once. Doing this will equip you with a broad arsenal of ideas that you can later put through the metaphorical <a href="https://tylertringas.com/business-ideas-meat-grinder/">“meat grinder”</a> (i.e. <a href="https://productideas.co/evaluation">evaluate</a> and <a href="https://productideas.co/validation">validate</a>).</p>

<p>In this essay I will not judge the different approaches (they’re all amazing!). My goal is merely to organize them within a common framework.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s dive in. (I discuss the different ideation methods in the order recommended by <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/validating_product_ideas">Patrick McKenzie</a>. However, feel free to approach them in any order you like.)</p>

<h2 id="organic-bottom-up-ideation">Organic, Bottom-Up Ideation</h2>

<p>Organic, bottom-up ideation is all about solving problems that you currently have yourself or had in the past. It’s a great method because the best ideas are often things that you notice rather than things that you purposefully come up with during a brainstorming session.</p>

<p>While “<a href="https://tylertringas.com/finding-micro-saas-business-ideas/">scratching your own itch</a>” might sound easy, it requires a lot of effort if you want to do it right. We all develop a certain blindness to our routines and daily processes. Hence, we need to actively turn the spotlight on and scrutinize all areas of our lives.</p>

<p>This includes your current job, your hobbies and all jobs you had in the past. For each of them ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What frictions did you encounter?</li>
  <li>What suboptimal processes did you notice?</li>
  <li>Did you found yourself wondering: “Why doesn’t someone make x?”</li>
  <li>What did you find frustrating? What made you think: “I shouldn’t have to x.”</li>
  <li>What would you spend money on without thinking if it existed?</li>
</ul>

<p>It makes a lot of sense to make it a habit to ask yourself this kind of questions regularly. With ideas, it’s like with radio frequency. You have to tune in to receive them and questions like the ones listed above will help you do that.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of organic, bottom up ideation is that <a href="https://levels.io/startups/">you’re an expert on your own problems</a> and hence in an ideal position to navigate the corresponding <a href="https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze">idea maze</a>.</p>

<p>However, the usefulness of organic, bottom-up ideation depends heavily on the kind of life you’re living. If you’re living an interesting life, full of intellectual adventures, you’ll have no problem spotting opportunities.</p>

<p>But if your life is more mundane, the ideas you’ll be able to come up with organically will be less promising.</p>

<p>For example, most college students will only be able to usual problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t know what I should do next Friday.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to find a sexual partner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only if you’re doing things that others don’t, you’ll be able to see what everyone else is missing.</p>

<p>An obvious solution to the “boring life”-problem is to start living a more interesting life and being more curious. This is what organic, top-down ideation is all about.</p>

<h2 id="organic-top-down-ideation">Organic, Top-Down Ideation</h2>

<p>A very poetic way to describe organic, top-down ideation was coined by Paul Graham: “Live in the future, then build what’s missing.” Formulated differently, if no promising ideas grow out of your own experiences, it’s time to become the kind of person who has more interesting product ideas.</p>

<p>This means that you purposefully pick a field (ideally one that will have a large impact in the future) and then immerse yourself in it. Hence, instead of starting with a specific problem you pick a new field and then try to get to the edge of it.</p>

<p>The most common way to do this is to get a job at a company in the space. Alternatively, you can, of course, also spend your free time dabbling in the field. For example, if you’re convinced that soon everyone will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT devices</a>, you could start by <a href="https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror">building a smart mirror</a> to get your feet wet and then move on to more ambitious projects.</p>

<p>If you pick a promising field, the organic, top-down approach will allow you to spot many new problems worth solving. Ideally, you pick a field that is on the verge of becoming the next big thing. After all, <a href="http://jakobgreenfeld.com/trends">everything is easier when you’re riding a wave</a>. Then the problems you want to be solved, a few years later, millions of other people will want to be solved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[S]ince the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them. Looking for waves is essentially a way to simulate the organic method. If you’re at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you don’t have to look for waves; you are the wave.” - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">Paul Graham</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting method to find industries and professions you could start to immerse yourself in is <a href="https://escapefromcubiclenation.libsyn.com/how-do-i-choose-which-business-to-start-">Pamela Slim’s month-long ideation exercise</a>. Each day you write down in a notebook how you respond to different things that occur in your life. After a while this will allow you to observe yourself like a scientist would observe an ant. Ideally, you’ll then be able to find patterns in the things that excite you. These are the things you should spend more time on.</p>

<p>A related useful method is to apply the principles of “curiosity overload” (h/t Daniel Priestley). Attend every event, listen to every sales pitch and subscribe to as much marketing material as you can find. If you bombard your brain this way, you’ll eventually notice interesting themes. As with Pamela Slim’s exercise, curiosity overload allows you to find out what kind of ideas get you excited. Moreover, it’s very likely that you stumble upon interesting inefficiencies and suboptimal processes. After all, if you fill your cup for a while it will eventually start pouring over.</p>

<p>Alternatively or supplementary, follow <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">Paul Graham’s advice:</a> “Look for smart people and hard problems. Smart people tend to clump together, and if you can find such a clump, it’s probably worthwhile to join it.”</p>

<p>The biggest downside of organic, top-down ideation is that it takes a lot of time. You can’t expect to get to the edge of a new field in just a few weeks. More realistically, we’re talking about years. This may only be viable if you’re young. Hence, inorganic ideation methods can be invaluable.</p>

<h2 id="inorganic-bottom-up-ideation">Inorganic, Bottom-Up Ideation</h2>

<p>Rather than focusing on problems that you know from your own experiences, you can also focus on other people’s problems.</p>

<p>If you talk to people to find their specific pains, we call this inorganic, bottom-up ideation since we’re again starting with specific problems of a single person. It’s just that this person is no longer you. As with organic, bottom-up ideation, the goal is to discover the most painful problems (processes) that you can then put through the “<a href="https://productideas.co/validation">meat grinder</a>”.</p>

<p>However, while it is already difficult to become aware of suboptimal processes and problems in your own life, it’s even harder to do this for other people. Everyone becomes to some extent numb to the pain they experience in their daily lives.</p>

<p>In theory, you make a list of all the people you could talk to, reach out, and then just ask them questions like:  “What’s tedious or annoying about your work?”</p>

<p>However, in practice it’s usually a lot more difficult than that. Proper <a href="https://nathanbarry.com/finding-ideas-project/">idea extraction</a> is a skill and an art. <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">Whole books</a> have been written about how to do it right. The main problem is that if you ask the wrong kind of questions, the answers you’re getting will either be not very helpful or even lead you astray.</p>

<p>For example, when someone tells you about a problem it’s essential to ask them: “What have you already tried to solve it?” If the answer is: “Nothing.” the problem is not painful enough. Your solution would merely be “nice to have”. A hallmark of good product ideas is that the problem is currently solved through awkward workarounds.</p>

<p>A cautionary tale that exemplifies how difficult it is to learn something by talking to people is what happened to anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead">Margaret Mead</a>. She lived with the villagers in Samoa, and tried to learn everything she could about the life of teenagers there by talking to them. Years later other scientists discovered that most of her findings were based on stories that were completely made up by her teenage subjects. The teenagers admitted that they had made up stories just for fun.</p>

<p>Hence, instead of talking to individual people it can make a lot of sense to observe what happens within a whole industry. In that case, we’re talking again about top-down ideation.</p>

<h2 id="inorganic-top-down-ideation">Inorganic, top-down ideation</h2>

<p>The key idea is, as with, organic, top-down ideation, to start with a specific industry in mind. But instead of immersing yourself in it, you observe it from the outside like a scientist.</p>

<p>The first task is to find out where the people in your industry hang out (“<a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/cant-find-audience/">watering holes</a>”). This could be, for example, online forums, Slack channels, Subreddit, or Facebook groups. Once you’ve discovered these places, you go there and start observing what is happening. You’ll have to learn the …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[CSS Layout – Grid vs. Flexbox]]>

<p>A good layout makes users stay on a site because it makes important stuff easily accessible and intuitive to find. A lousy layout frustrates users, who leave because they can’t find what they are looking for.</p>
<div><p>In web design, <em>a layout</em> is a term that explains how a website is displayed on the screen. HTML 5 has quite a few elements that define parts of a web page: <em>header, nav, section, aside, article</em>, and <em>footer</em> are the significant distinctions in creating a layout. They constitute the four major sections of a webpage - <em>header/banner, navigation, content</em>, and <em>footer</em>.</p><p>Programming languages make websites feel alive, but at the core of every web page stands the good old HTML. When we discuss layouts, we must consider factors that make <em>a good</em> layout: responsiveness, viewing ports, display devices, browsers, and users’ screen sizes. A great layout not only looks great but can preserve the original intent by fitting in every possible display ratio. This correction is produced through CSS. In this article, we will examine two powerful properties: <em>CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid</em>.</p></div>

<h2>WHAT IS CSS FLEXBOX LAYOUT?</h2>
<div><p>The Flexible Box Module, commonly shortened to ‘flexbox,’ is a one-dimensional layout model. This means it deals with either row or column at a time but never both together. Flexbox is efficient when in aligning, distributing, and directing elements in a page.</p><p>Two key terminologies in Flexbox are the <strong>main axis</strong> and the <strong>cross axis</strong>. A flex container's main axis is the primary axis along which these flex items are laid out, and the cross-axis is perpendicular to it.</p><p>To start, we will wrap our HTML <em>divs</em> in a <em>flex-wrapper</em>.&nbsp;</p></div>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="flex-wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;div id="one"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="two"&gt;Nav&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="three"&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;  
  &lt;div id="four"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In CSS, our parent container, "flex-wrapper" will be converted to a flexbox with a simple line of code. </p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper { 
  display: flex; 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>I'll be adding a few elements and properties with bright colors and margins to make our <i>containers</i> and <i>divs</i> stand out.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  background-color: beige; 
} 
.flex-wrapper &gt; div { 
  background-color: green; 
  height: 100px; 
  width: 100px; 
  margin: 10px; 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>You can see how nicely the div elements position itself horizontally. But if you notice, it doesn’t entirely take up all the space within the container. There’s a gap at the end. We can change this by adding <b>flex-grow</b>.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper &gt; div { 
  flex-grow: 1; 
}</code></pre>
<p>The flex-grow element distributes each item in a flex container. The default is 0, and by assigning a unit number to any of the <em>divs</em>, you can make it grow more massive than the rest. The opposite of this is <b>flex-shrink</b>.</p>
<pre><code>#one{ 
  flex-grow: 10;
} 
/* this gives the first div ten more units than the others */
</code></pre>
<h3>Flex-direction</h3>
<p>Flex-direction controls the direction in which items in a flex container should face. You can make the <em>divs</em> go up, down, left, and right. You can also have them in reverse order. By default, items in a flex-container are ordered from left to right, horizontally, within the main axis.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: row; /* default direction */ 
}
.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: row-reverse;  
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, the items are displayed from left to right, but in reverse order. The fourth <em>div</em> now becomes the first and the first — the last.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: column; 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>divs</em> are ordered from in a vertical manner - from up to down.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper{ 
  display: flex; 
  flex-direction: column-reverse; 
}</code></pre>
<p>The <em>divs</em> are ordered vertically, but in reverse, where the fourth <em>div</em> is at the top, and the first one is at the bottom.</p>
<h3>Flex Basis</h3>
<p>Flex basis defines the size of an item or a div inside the flex-container. This size value can be in <em>em, px,</em> or <em>percentage</em>. Flex-basis is different from flex-grow because it doesn’t equally share the space between items in a container.</p>
<pre><code>#three { 
  flex-basis: 200px; 
}</code></pre>
<h3>Flex</h3>
<p>Flex is a shorthand property that combines flex-shrink, flex-grow and flex-basis. It is recommended that you use this property instead of writing each individual property and its value. The order to set the values for the property is this: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper { 
  display: flex; 
  flex: 0 0 200px; 
} 
</code></pre>
<h3>Justify-content and align-self</h3>
<p>Justify-content and align-self is the perfect solution to centralize a <em>div</em> or a container on a browser using flexbox.</p>
<pre><code>.flex-wrapper { 
  display: flex; 
  flex: 0 0 200px; 
  justify-content: center; 
  align-items: center; 
} 
</code></pre>
<h2>CSS Layout GRID</h2>
<p>CSS grid is a powerful 2-dimensional layout. This means <b>it can handle both the rows and columns of the layout</b>. CSS grid works with a 12-grid arrangement, where the screen is (invisibly) divided into 12 parts, and items must fit into this arrangement.<br <br=""><b>CSS grid's advantage over flexbox and other layout models is its two-dimensional quality</b>. It also makes positioning more straightforward, and the container’s elements can be set to overlap and overlap each other.</p>
<h3>Defining a grid in CSS grid</h3>
<p>A simple CSS line will transform an HTML structure to a CSS grid.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt; 
  &lt;div id="one"&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div id="two"&gt;Nav&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div id="three"&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;  
  &lt;div id="four"&gt;Aside&lt;/div&gt;   
  &lt;div id="five"&gt;Section&lt;/div&gt;  
  &lt;div id="six"&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
} 
</code></pre>
<h3>Grid template-columns and grid-template-rows</h3>
<p>The grid-template-columns and grid-template-row define the size of a column or row. It assigns a <i>div</i> a size depending on what is assigned. When you set the size of a template-column and template-grid size, you use <i>px, fr, percentage, or em</i>.</p>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns:  40px 1fr 20%;  
  grid-template-rows: 200px; 
  background-color: beige;   
}
.container &gt; div { 
  background-color: green; 
  margin: 10px; 
} 
</code></pre>
<div><p><b>grid-template-columns:</b> 40px 1fr 20%; - this line of code tells the browser to assign the first div a width of 40px. The second takes one fraction of the assigned space and the third 20%. Automatically, <em>divs</em> 4 to 6 move below the first 3, and takes on the values assigned in the same order. This means <em>div</em> 4 is assigned 40px, <em>div</em> 5 one fraction and <em>div</em> 6, 20%.</p><p>To place all six <em>divs</em> on one line, we must assign six values to the grid-template-column. We do not have to give different measurements to the grid-columns. We could use only <em>percentages, fr,</em> or <em>px</em>.</p><p>
<b>grid-template-rows:</b> 200px; - this assigns all the divs a height of 200px;</p></div>
<h3>FR</h3>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: 16.7% 16.7% 16.7% 16.7% 16.7% 16.7%;  
} 
</code></pre>
<div><p>By assigning 16.7% in 6 places, I have successfully divided the six divs in the container into six equal parts on the screen. I used 16.7 because 16.7 times 6 gives 100% of the screen width.</p><p>Using percentage and px works perfectly, but it lacks adequate flexibility and belies the most useful resource - <b>a fraction of the CSS grid</b>.</p><p><b>Fr</b> is a fractional unit. It assigns each item one fraction of available space. The fractional space can be increased to accommodate each div according to how much space they need.</p><p>Our grid-template-columns now becomes</p></div>
<pre><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; 
</code></pre>
<p>This divides each div equally on the screen.</p>
<pre><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr 2fr 1fr 1fr; 
</code></pre>
<p>This new value makes the second and fourth div twice the size of the rest. Most importantly, it is still distributed evenly on the browser and very much responsive.</p>
<h3>Repeat Function</h3>
<p>Rather than write down the values repeatedly, we can take advantage of the repeat function to assign values once.</p>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
}</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is relatively straightforward. We need to use the word ‘repeat’ and then assign how many times we want the size repeated, which is 6, and then give the measurement value. This repeat function works with <em>fr, em, px</em> as well as <em>percentage</em>. This works for template-row as well.</p>
<h3>Gap</h3>
<p>Gap, also called <em>gutter</em> is a CSS grid property that allows you to specify the gap-space between <em>divs</em> in a CSS grid container. It works just like the margin property and is calculated mainly in <em>px</em>.</p>
<pre><code>gap: 10px;</code></pre>
<h3>Grid-column-start/grid-column-end and grid-row-start/grid-row-end</h3>
<p>The grid-column-start and grid-column-end place a grid item in a particular location within the column by referring to specific grid lines. The grid-row-start and grid-row-end also do the same to the row. By assigning a value to this property, grid items can be conveniently manipulated to start and end within the specified areas.</p>
<pre><code>.container { 
  display: grid; 
  grid-template-columns: repeat (3, 1fr); 
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 200px); 
}
#one { 
  grid-column-start: 1; 
  grid-column-end: 3; 
  grid-row-start: 1; 
  grid-row-end: 4; 
}</code></pre>
<div><p>When you assign these values to the first div, you’ll notice it pushes the second div one unit away, and it occupies the first two positions, pushing div 3 below. Row-wise, it now occupies three positions giving it a longer height.</p><p>There is a rule when indexing in programming because we generally count from 0, which applies here. The last value is usually mentioned, but not put into effect. For example, the grid-column-end is 3, but it stops at 2 just like the grid-row-end, which ends at 3 and not 4.</p></div>
<h3>Grid-columns and grid-row</h3>
<p>Gap, also called <em>gutter</em> is a CSS grid property that allows you to specify the gap-space between <em>divs</em> in a CSS grid container. It works just like the margin property and is calculated mainly in <em>px</em>.</p>
<pre><code>#one { 
  grid-column: 1/3; 
  grid-row: 1/4; 
}</code></pre>
<h3>Creating galleries using CSS grid</h3>
<p>CSS grid is the perfect model to create galleries. With little code and manipulation, you could make perfect, responsive gallery layouts.</p>
<h4>A Mosaic Gallery Layout</h4>
<p>A mosaic gallery layout creates even tiles of images distributed evenly over a page/container.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt; 
  &lt;div id="one"&gt;Image One&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div id="two"&gt;Image Two&lt;/div&gt; 
  &lt;div…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
			
<div><p>Ever fallen down the ‘apples and pears’? Have you had your ‘barnet’ chopped recently? Called a mate on the old ‘dog and bone’? Or, ‘aven’t you a scooby’ about what all of that means?</p><p>Sit back, grab a nice cuppa ‘Rosy Lee’, and all will be explained.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>These phrases belong to the vernacular of Cockney rhyming slang, a code-like way of speaking that originated in mid-19th century East London. You may remember your grandparents speaking it growing up, or perhaps you’ve heard a phrase or two being thrown about as you walk down <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/roman-road-market-history/">Roman Road Market</a>, hunting for a bargain.</p>



<div><p>Leanne, who works in <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/g-kelly-pie-mash-shop-working-class-food/">G Kelly</a>, said that hearing rhyming slang in the East End ‘isn’t as common these days’. ‘Pie and liquor is the Cockney rhyming slang for vicar’, she smilingly told us as she ladled the legendary parsley sauce. </p><p>Despite being less popular today, its old prevalence can still be heard, or seen, on our local streets. ‘<a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/bottlejob-craft-off-licence-shop-opens-globe-road/">BottleJob</a>‘, the bottle shop and craft off-licence in Globe Town, takes its name from a Cockney rhyming slang expression used to mean ‘coward’, which owner Alex Dehayen recalls as his grandfather’s affectionate nickname for him.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Due to its largely spoken nature, there are very few written records of its roots, but it was supposedly the language of stallholders and criminals. Thieves and vagabonds could use this type of ‘cryptolect’, a secretive language, to keep their liaisons well kept from eavesdropping authorities. A type of ‘in-the-know’ jargon, aiming to exclude or mislead anyone from outside of the Cockney bubble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A sense of pride and nostalgia transpired from our Facebook call out about Cockney rhyming slang memories, particularly from the children that can remember their parents and grandparents using it. Mary Demmel remembers her aunt Mag leaving her house to get the bus saying “let me get me ole grey mare out”, meaning ‘fare’. Carol Legg’s nan ‘used to talk of the Artful that lived up the road’, referring to the lodger (Artful Dodger).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pete Bailey, who comes from Hackney, recalled, ‘Growing up on the market, I used to hear everyone speaking it. Now it’s just a rare thing. I was at a football match last season and was standing with our captain’s girlfriend. She was shivering so I handed her my scarf and said, “Get that round your Gregory”. She looked at me funny and said, “What are you talking about?”. I’m trying to keep the Cockney language alive by teaching my godchildren.’</p>



<p>More commonly used today to describe a working class London accent, the term ‘Cockney’ actually has a specific geographical radius. It is officially defined as someone born within earshot of the chiming bells of Cheapside’s St Mary-le-Bow Church.</p>



<div><p>So, how exactly does this old-school lingo work? And, how on earth does a word like ‘plates’ come to mean ‘feet’? In its simplest form, a common word (feet) is typically replaced by a rhyming phrase of two or three words (plates of meat). The most proficient Cockney would usually shorten this back down to one word (plates). And, there you have it. Suddenly the expression ‘me plates are killing me’ translates as ‘my feet hurt’.</p><p>Don’t be fooled by the off-the-tongue ease at which it is most authentically delivered. These sayings can get confusingly cryptic. ‘Double slang’ is even harder to unscramble; this is how the name of a Greek philosopher came to mean one’s derrière. Aris is short for Aristotle. Aristotle rhymes with bottle. Bottle and glass rhymes with…you might want to have a go at working that one out yourself.</p></div>



<p>Marian Peck commented on our Facebook call out explaining her recollections of ‘backslang’. She said, ‘<strong>I</strong> think there were a couple of versions, but the one Cyril used was to take off the first letter of the word and put an ‘a’ on the end. So cat would be ‘ata’, television would be ‘elevisiona’.He came from Poplar, but worked as a bell boy in a London Hotel in the 1920s. Apparently a lot of staff could speak it and so the guests would not know what they were saying if they wanted to have a private conversation. My sister had go at it and tried to teach me, but I never had the patience!’</p>



<p>Some terms were born out of the summers that Cockneys spent hop picking. Whole families from the poorer parts of London would migrate ‘down to Kent’ to work on the fields, providing the surge of manual labour needed at harvest time. ‘Cherry’ is slang for ‘dog’, relating to the ‘cherry hog’ container that was used to collect crops. East Ender, Kim West, recalls, ‘I remember as a child in the hop fields, the adults would use slang and us kids would pick it up. The farmer would not understand a word’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other older examples relate to London locations. ‘Peckham Rye’ meaning ‘tie’, ‘Hampstead Heath’ meaning ‘teeth’ and ‘Tilbury Docks’ meaning ‘socks’. An all time favourite, first recorded in the 1850s, has to be ‘Barnet (fair)’, relating to one’s hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century, celebrity names began to influence these linguistic inventions. Musician Hank Marvin’ came to mean ‘starving’, singer Ruby Murray morphed into a synonym for ‘curry’, and racing driver Ayrton Senna was the new way of saying ‘tenner’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the 2012 Olympics, an ATM on Commercial Street gave customers the language option of ‘Cockney rhyming slang’. To withdraw a bit of ’sausage and mash’ (cash), you were first asked to enter your ‘Huckleberry Finn’ (pin). This led to monetary prompts such as ‘Lady Godiva’ (£5) and ‘Horn of Plenty’ (£20).&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>In 1987, Mile End born record producer Paul Oakenfold coined the slang phrase ‘It’s all gone Pete Tong’, meaning ‘a bit wrong’. He wrote it in an article about acid house called ‘Bermondsey Goes Balearic’ for ‘Boy’s Own’ fanzine. Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong adopted it as the name for his Ibiza club night set and his nightly radio programme in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether from Del Boy or Danny Dyer, you have probably heard a bit of Cockney rhyming slang when watching the custard (telly – from ‘custard and jelly’). Some phrases even made it to DisneyLand via the lamplighters and chimney sweepers of ‘Mary Poppins’.</p></div>



<p>From <a href="https://romanroadlondon.com/knees-up-mother-brown-song-history/">old cockney classics</a>, like ‘My Old Man’s a Dustman’, to the lyrics of The Kinks and The Streets, you may have heard some rhyming slang sing from your record player or through your speakers.</p>



<p>Although it comes from the East End, the use of Cockney rhyming slang spreads far beyond the Bow Bells. The East Midlands accent has substituted ‘Derby Road’ for ‘cold’ and, down under, the name of Australian businessman Reg Grundy created ‘grundies’ (an Aussie word for ‘undies’).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite their travels, these phrases are undoubtedly heard most satisfyingly from the buoyant vocal box of a true, old-school, Cockney. In fact, some terms won’t make sense in any other accent. ‘Joanna’ means piano, relying on the ‘piannah’ pronunciation.&nbsp; Bawdy, bolshy and cheeky, the organically East End intonations perfectly capture the lingo’s playful charm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is the tradition dying out? A study carried out by the Museum of London in 2012 surveyed 2000 people, half of them Londoners, about their understanding and use of Cockney rhyming slang. It emerged that just 8% used the terms in everyday speech. The changing face of society, with new multi-cultural influences and the rise of virtual communication, is more aptly reflected in the contemporary slang of today’s youth.</p>



<p>However, that’s not to say that Cockney rhyming slang is a distant memory. New references to popular culture have been updating the canon since Victoria sat on the throne.&nbsp; The famous cartoon dog ‘Scooby Doo’ even managed to make the cut when ‘not a scooby’ came to mean ‘not a clue’.</p>



<div><p>Some phrases have become obsolete, but some are here to stay. Just as Shakespeare’s plays gave us terms like ‘a laughing stock’ and ‘a pound of flesh’, the old rhymes of East End folk have seeped right into the heart of the English Language. So, despite change and time, maybe it’ll never really be ‘brown bread’.</p><p>To find out more about Cockney rhyming slang, you can watch this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=299871854075637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archive footage</a> about how it was used.</p></div>

<p>Bluetooth Audio is generally considered convenient, but not ‘audiophile’. Any self respecting audiophile is probably connecting their fancy headphones to some Digital to Analog Converter/Amp combo which might be connected to their computer using some fancy gold plated USB Cable. More power to them, I am not self respecting. I made a decision a few months ago to switch entirely to Bluetooth Audio as the convenience and tidiness of having a wireless headset just appealed to me so much.</p>
<p>I purchased the M-Pow H21s - which are a fairly budget noise cancelling pair of Bluetooth headphones. They appealed to me because they weren’t enormously expensive, and other M-Pow stuff I’d purchased in the past was of good enough quality for me to trust these would be too. I wasn’t wrong. The noise cancelling is reasonably good, and the sound profile, while not ‘neutral’ - is totally fine for me to use while working.</p>
<p>One thing that really did annoy me about these headphones (and I’m not sure if the fault lies with Bluetooth Audio on Linux or with the headphones themselves) is that if I walked away from my desk and then returned, the audio quality would perceptibly drop, but never quite recover. It seemed to get ‘stuck’ at a lower quality, until the headset was rebooted. One day, I got tired of this, so decided to research what was going on.</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was A2DP - or the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile. This is a Bluetooth profile - which describes a method by which audio can be transmitted between a sender and a receiver. The profile mandates that all Bluetooth devices support a codec called SBC - or Low Complexity Subband Codec. A codec defines exactly how the device that is sending the audio should compress it. SBC is what’s known as a Low Complexity codec. Low Complexity codecs have the design goal of being easy to encode for the sender and being easy to decode for the receiver. It’s a fairly old codec, being the precursor to MP2 - itself the precursor of MP3. When consumers started demanding better quality audio out of their Bluetooth hardware, various other codecs were added to hardware. Some hardware added MP3 encoding and decoding - which was a small improvement in two ways. Firstly, if the source material was already MP3, and the encoder was smart enough, the MP3 data could directly be sent to the receiver, meaning that no encoding step was necessary. Secondly, MP3 is generally considered to be a better codec in terms of the resulting audio quality, so even if there was an encoding step, the results were generally better. Apple added AAC support to their hardware - which itself is a far superior codec to MP3 lends much the same benefits. The freshest codec which seems to be available is from a company that Qualcomm gobbled up - aptX. This codec is interesting in the sense that it only offers the second advantage talked about above. Nobody has music in aptX format, which meant that all source material must be re-encoded on the device sending the audio.</p>

<p>The first step to identifying if improvements can be made to your own Bluetooth Audio is to figure out which codecs your Bluetooth Headset supports. You can generally find this out by finding the manufacturers information. My particular headset, the h21 - is dumb as rocks, and only supports SBC. If your headset supports a better codec, especially if it supports a codec called LDAC - you should very much consider trying that before trying to do what we’ll be doing in this article, which is improving the quality available to us using the SBC codec. <a href="https://www.nextpit.com/bluetooth-audio-codecs">This article does a reasonably good job of covering all the codecs.</a></p>
<p>No matter what your headphones support, the next thing you’re going to want to do is install a custom PulseAudio module which both enables support for a bunch of more fancy codecs, and also allows you to configure the codecs. Go grab <a href="https://github.com/EHfive/pulseaudio-modules-bt/wiki/Packages">EHfive/pulseaudio-modules-bt</a> and restart PulseAudio. You should already see in your systems sound settings you can now actually select between AAC, APTX, APTX HD, and LDAC - if your headset supports it. You can probably stop here if you’re able to switch to APTX or LDAC. If not, it’s time to configure SBC to be less sucky.</p>

<h4>default.pa, with the changes</h4>

</figure>
<p>So, a quick review of the options the SBC encoder has that we likely care about. Firstly, the Stereo mode. Generally in audio the two stereo modes we have are.. well Stereo and Joint Stereo. Stereo transmits two distinct channels of audio in the same stream, but completely distinct from one another. Joint stereo makes the assumption that the left and right channels are probably similar enough that just encoding how the right channel differs from the left will result in a more efficient packing of data. Your headset is likely already using one of these two modes. SBC actually supports a third mode, called dual - which essentially sends two audio streams to your headset, completely independently of one another. This effectively doubles the bit-rate your headset can operate at, since you now will have two separate streams of audio being encoded, rather than just one. If your headset supports this dual mode, and it most likely does, you definitely want it. In fact, this unofficial feature has been added to a popular custom Android OS - called LineageOS, <a href="https://www.lineageos.org/engineering/Bluetooth-SBC-XQ/">and they describe the benefit of this very well here</a>.</p>
<p>The next option we likely care about is the bitpool. The bitpool effectively determines the bitrate the audio will be encoded at. The higher, the better. <a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/sbc-bitrate-calculator/">A calculator is available here</a> but what is shows is that at the default highest available Bitpool value (53) in Joint Stereo mode - the maximum available bitrate is 328kbps. If we do nothing else, and just switch to Dual Channel mode - the bitrate predictably roughly doubles to 617.4kbps. Some headsets, like my H21s, actually seem to do fine at higher bitpool values. Through experimentation, I found that around 70 was as much as my headset could manage without hearing the audio equivalent of a buffer overflow. At a bitpool value of 70, in dual channel mode, the bitrate now gets to 804.8kbps!</p>
<p>If you are experimenting with a different headset, I suggest starting with a bitpool value of 53 and dual stereo enabled. You can then experiment with increasing the bitpool value, as described below.</p>
<p>To modify these values, you’ll need to edit <code>/etc/pulse/default.pa</code>. Firstly, find the lind that begins <code>load-module module-bluetooth-discover</code>. Modify it to add these flags, like so:</p>
<p><code>load-module module-bluetooth-discover a2dp_config="sbc_cmode=dual sbc_min_bp=53 sbc_min_bp=53 sbc_freq=44k"</code></p>
<p>This will lock your SBC encoder to work at a bitpool size of 53 - in dual stereo mode. Restart PulseAudio by doing <code>pulseaudio -k</code> - and reconnect your Bluetooth headset. Hopefully, you’ll perceive a large improvement in quality, as I did. You can now experiment by changing that value of 53 for a higher value. <a href="https://btcodecs.valdikss.org.ru/codec-compatibility/">There’s a list of known compatibility available here</a>.</p>
<p>The one downside of this approach of locking the encoder to work at a particular bitpool is that you lose graceful degredation of quality as the link quality reduces. You could experiment with having a lower value for the <code>sbc_min_bp</code> so that the encoder can reduce quality.</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps you!</p>

October 13, 2020 | https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-10-13-sending-webmentions-from-a-static-website | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-10-13-sending-webmentions-from-a-static-website">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>A few months back I wrote about <a href="https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-06-27-indieweb-ifying-my-personal-website">indieweb-ifying this website</a>. I attempted to follow the excellent <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">indiewebify.me guide</a>, but I skipped step 2 of Level 2, i.e. <a href="https://indiewebify.me/#send-webmentions">adding the ability to send Webmentions to other IndieWeb sites</a>. My <a href="https://jamesmead.org/blog/2020-06-27-indieweb-ifying-my-personal-website#publishing-on-the-indieweb">excuse</a> at the time was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I decided to skip this step for now given that it's relatively easy to <a href="https://indieweb.org/webmention-implementation-guide#One-liner_webmentions">send a Webmention manually using <code>curl</code></a> and it's not as if I currently blog that frequently!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway a couple of recent discoveries led me to fix this omission…</p>

<h3 id="webmentionapp">webmention.app</h3>

<p>This lovely little <a href="https://webmention.app/">service</a> built by <a href="https://remysharp.com/">Remy Sharp</a>, not to be confused with <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> which is used for <em>receiving</em> incoming <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a>, makes it easy to <em>send</em> outgoing webmentions for all the links on a given page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a platform agnostic service that will check a given URL for links to other sites, discover if they support webmentions, then send a webmention to the target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately I still have an <a href="http://feeds.jamesmead.org/floehopper-blog">RSS feed</a> for my blog and in this case the documentation <a href="https://webmention.app/docs#using-ifttt-to-trigger-checks">suggests using IFTTT</a> to automate doing this each time you publish an article.</p>

<h3 id="actionsflow">Actionsflow</h3>

<p>Somewhat serendipitously I recently came across <a href="https://actionsflow.github.io/docs/">Actionsflow</a> which is a free Zapier/IFTTT alternative for developers to automate workflows based on GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I was initially quite confused by the Actionsflow documentation and I tried to add my Webmention-sending workflow to <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/jamesmead.org">the repo for this website</a>. However, once I realised the idea was to <a href="https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow-workflow-default/generate">create a new repo</a> based on a template, things became a little clearer.</p>

<h3 id="workflow-to-send-webmentions">Workflow to send Webmentions</h3>

<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions">this repo</a> and added <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions/blob/main/workflows/send-webmentions.yml">this workflow</a> to poll my RSS feed and send an HTTP POST request to the webmention.app API for every new item. I was pleasantly surprised by how simple this was:</p>

<pre><code>name: Send webmentions for new blog posts
on:
  rss:
    url: http://feeds.jamesmead.org/floehopper-blog
    config:
      logLevel: debug
      limit: 1
jobs:
  send_webmentions:
    name: Send webmentions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Send webmentions for RSS item link'
        uses: actionsflow/axios@v1
        with:
          url: https://webmention.app/check/
          method: 'POST'
          params: '{ "url": "${{on.rss.outputs.link}}", "token": "${{ secrets.WM_TOKEN }}" }'
          is_debug: true
</code></pre>

<p>It took me a while to realise that the underlying Actionsflow GitHub Action was running every 5 minutes and <em>polling</em> my RSS feed. It seems to use the GitHub Action cache to "remember" which items it has seen before. Since I don't publish blog posts very often, polling every 5 minutes seemed a bit excessive and so I decided to <a href="https://github.com/floehopper/send-webmentions/commit/eb5a9cb573b1c532c92143b7fb2aed260c5fa552">reduce the frequency to hourly</a>.</p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I'm not sure I like the design of Actionsflow which means creating a new repo, but perhaps this would make more sense to me if I had more than one workflow. I suppose this repo is roughly equivalent to a single IFTTT account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the course of the last year I've automated some backup jobs for <a href="https://gofreerange.com/">Go Free Range</a> using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/typescript/api/aws-ecs-patterns/scheduledfargatetask.html#aws_ecs_patterns_ScheduledFargateTask"><code>ScheduledFargateTask</code> class</a> in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">AWS CDK</a> to fire up a container and run a script on a cron schedule. This has worked really well, but it's quite tempting to port these over to Actionsflow so we don't have to maintain anything other than the <code>Dockerfile</code> and associated shell scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>webmention.app is really nicely implemented with good documentation; it's a classic example of an elegant solution to a tightly scoped problem. Since I'll be making use of the API on a regular basis, I decided to <a href="https://jamesmead.org/blog/paypal.me/rem">buy Remy a drink</a> to say thank you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I'd also like to find a way to say thank you to <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a> who built webmention.io and <a href="https://snarfed.org/">Ryan Barrett</a>, <a href="https://kylewm.com/">Kyle Mahan</a>, et al who built <a href="https://brid.gy/">brid.gy</a>. However, I can't see a way to do either and, indeed, the latter <a href="https://brid.gy/about#cost">explicitly say</a> "We don't need donations, promise."</p>
  </li>
</ul>

Eclogiselle is intended to be a compendium of free resources for small communities with paid services available below $5000. In fact, I hope to be able to offer some services for well under a thousand dollars.

</p><p>


I am looking to serve small communities that would have trouble hiring someone at all to do planning and economic development work for them. I am hoping to find creative ways to provide useful resources for communities who often either cannot afford paid staff or cannot find someone willing to work for them for what they can afford to pay.

</p><hr><p>
The small town I live in made an offer to a candidate for their city manager position and the candidate turned them down and took a higher paying job elsewhere. That seems to be par for the course.

</p><p>

Years ago when I was looking to become a professional planner, I haunted the online job listings. A lot of small communities kept the same job openings available for months at a time because of the challenges they face in filling such positions at all.

</p><p>
I have first-hand experience with my local <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitizenPlanners/comments/duf6ae/main_street_america/">Main Street America</a> program. This is the leading voice for preservation-based economic development and community revitalization across the US. 
</p><p>
It is aimed at revitalizing small towns. In order to be an accredited Main Street program, you need to have an executive director: 

</p><ul><li>0-2500 people = half time volunteer Executive Director</li>

  <li>2500-5000 = half time paid Executive Director</li>

  <li>5000+ = full time paid Executive Director</li></ul><p>

So this well-established program doesn't expect a town of less than 2500 people to be able to pay their economic development director <i>at all</i>. It's a part-time, volunteer position for such communities. It's basically a labor of love. 
</p><p>
For towns between 2500 and 5000 people, they only expect them to be able to pay for a part-time director. It's only for communities above 5000 that they expect you to have a full-time paid executive director for this non-profit economic development entity.

</p><p>
Please note that if they have a full-time executive director, this is probably their only paid employee. There will also be a board running the non-profit and those are all unpaid positions.

</p><p>
So all the evidence suggests that small communities have trouble hiring planning and economic development staff <i>at all</i>, whether it is a city job or a job at a local non-profit trying to fill in the gaps in their small town. And when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/j5a0vr/dark_side_question_typical_services_and_prices_at/">I asked around</a>, the answers I got suggest small communities face additional challenges when they look to contract out services instead of hiring paid staff to serve them.
</p><p>
In one reply to my query, I was given a link to <a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/triboro/kinnelon-council-members-fear-environmental-resource-e348f325fc">an article</a> from 2012 where The Land Conservancy of New Jersey was offering to do an Environmental Resources Inventory (ERI) for Kinnelon, a burrough in New Jersey. They were offering it at a discount and the price was expected to be $10,000 (back in 2012 -- no doubt, prices have gone up since then).
</p><p>
<a href="https://tlc-nj.org/">The Land Conservancy of New Jersey</a> is apparently a <i>non-profit</i> land trust that has a goal of protecting open space. The person who left the link implied that this is probably a typical fee for non-profits and universities serving this space for small communities.

</p><p>

Non-profits and universities are supposed to be the good guys, the affordable option, the folks doing it out of idealism and not to make a quick buck. But it doesn't take much digging to be suspicious of this $10,000 ERI and why it is being pushed.
</p><p>
In the article, one person objecting to paying for the ERI said, in part, <i>All we do is keep spending money and no ones giving us money.</i> so I pulled up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinnelon,_New_Jersey">Wikipedia page for Kinnelon</a>, New Jersey and, unsurprisingly, this is a wealthy suburb.
</p><p>
According to Wikipedia, in 2012 they were among the top 500 most expensive zip codes in the US. It lists them as at number 462.
</p><p>
A quick search tells me there are nearly 42,000 zip codes in the US. If you pull out a calculator and divide 462 by 42,000, the result is 0.011. So we are talking about people who are just outside of the One Percent. 
</p><p>
I read this article and I see vague, hand-wavy claims that this ERI is "useful for planning efforts" and I also see people complaining about a pattern of being bled for money over the years without getting results. I can readily believe they are being taken advantage of. 

</p><p>
I can believe that people keep going to Kinnelon burrough, selling them services "at a discount" (because "we are the good guys") for thousands of dollars -- because these people can come up with the money -- and the services aren't actually useful for development.
</p><p>
The other thing I was told was that most for-profit, private planning firms do not actively seek out projects that are below about $5k. If you approach them, they might do a small project for you, but chasing it down isn't worth it. It doesn't pay well enough.

</p><p>

Before life got in the way, I wanted to be a professional planner. I've spent years around online planning forums and attending local meetings and what not and I think I would have trouble finding a private planning firm. 
</p><p>
They seem to me to not be very visible. I'm not exactly an insider because I never got the career I wanted, but you would think this would be less opaque to me.
</p><p>

So my impression is that planning firms are hard to identify by small communities, aren't actively seeking business from small communities because it doesn't pay well enough and may not even take a bid from you even if you approach them. If it's only a few thousand dollars, they seem to feel like they are doing you some kind of favor if they are willing to work with you.

</p><p>

I am in Aberdeen, Washington. It is in a region I have dubbed The Pacific Coastal Region of Washington State or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/">CoastalWA</a>. 

</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bGDP0jo2muo/X4Tk73UfcOI/AAAAAAAAGyU/ng7YAFlb8jEcNG137qzgwJx-WcKRulB5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/CoastalWA256sq.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="256" data-original-width="256" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bGDP0jo2muo/X4Tk73UfcOI/AAAAAAAAGyU/ng7YAFlb8jEcNG137qzgwJx-WcKRulB5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/CoastalWA256sq.png"></a></p><p>



This is a region with a sparse number of small towns and a large number of unincorporated communities. There is at least a half million people, two or three dozen incorporated small towns and probably upwards of 200 unincorporated communities.

</p><p>
And most likely an influx of people will be coming here in the next few years because it is a relative safe haven from things like climate change. So I think the many small communities in this region need to begin preparing for growth if they don't want a bunch of well-heeled outsiders to come in and run rough-shod over the people who are already here.

</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/comments/j4u0by/welcome/">
  Welcome to CoastalWA</a></li><li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/comments/izecag/counties_of_coastal_wa/">Counties of CoastalWA</a></li><li>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoastalWA/comments/iztsji/coastal_wa_is_a_relative_safe_haven_in_2020/">CoastalWA is A Relative Safehaven</a></li></ul><p>

So I think there is tremendous need for free and low cost economic development and planning resources and services that would work well for small communities. The only question in my mind is if I can figure out how to package up offerings that make sense for both me and them and find a way to connect with the people who need it.

    <p>Have you ever wondered why people write their own memory allocators? Are they masochists? Do they think they can write a better memory allocator than the OS? Shouldn’t they just use a garbage collected language instead?</p>

<h2 id="why-bother-with-custom-allocators">Why bother with custom allocators?</h2>

<p>Around 2010 or so when Chipmunk2D was new(ish), it didn’t use any custom allocators. Even temporary data was allocated when needed, tracked, and freed when I was done with it. At the time I was developing it, I was using OS X, and this was more or less fine. I even have some old stress test videos on YouTube with tens of thousands of colliding objects in real time on an old Core 2 Duo laptop. Running the same code on Windows XP wasn’t so great however. Had somebody suggested using a custom allocator, I probably would have turned my nose up at the idea and said something like “That’s dumb, I can do something simpler.” Besides, looking at sampling profiler data on OS X was telling me that memory functions weren’t even 1% of the CPU time after all. Why bother trying to make the allocator more efficient? On the other hand I knew what I had really wanted to do was to try and pack all of my collision data together to make it cache friendly. So what I did was to keep pools of various types of structs. If I needed a collision pair struct, I could just grab one from the pool. If the pool was empty, I’d allocate a few more kilobytes of them in a big block first. I did something similar for contact data, but since it only needed to be kept for a single frame I could release entire blocks of it back to the pools all at once. This solved my Windows performance problem, and the locality made for a very nice performance bump on other platforms too!</p>

<p>The astute reader is probably performing a face palm right now as I’ve just described a slab allocator and a zone allocator. :)</p>

<h3 id="no-need-for-a-better-malloc">No need for a better <code>malloc()</code></h3>

<p>So what does <code>malloc()</code> give us anyway?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to nearly unlimited amounts of virtual memory</li>
  <li>Create or free individual allocations of any size</li>
  <li>Safe, transparent access to allocations from any thread</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all great features, and it would be difficult to implement a reasonably generic replacement. On the other hand, many programs and systems within them have unique memory requirements. For Chipmunk2D’s collision system what I needed was completely different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Memory locality</li>
  <li>Predictable performance</li>
  <li>Simplified memory ownership</li>
</ul>

<p>So while I didn’t know it at the time, I had several reasons to want a custom allocator, and I accidentally implemented several! The last item in particular is interesting to me because it’s completely antithetical to what I used to think custom allocators were all about. I had a model in my head where custom allocators were about performance, and garbage collection to be about simplifying ownership, but it turns out the two are not so mutually exclusive. Using some custom allocator techniques in a garbage collected language can improve performance, and using them in a traditional language can give many of the same benefits as if you had garbage collection.</p>

<h3 id="more-reasons-to-bother-with-custom-allocators">More reasons to bother with custom allocators</h3>

<p>Over the years, I’ve wasted <em>many</em> hours debugging memory issues. With just a hash table and a set of linked lists, you can track the history of all your allocations. That makes it pretty easy to track down use after free errors, double free errors, and memory leaks. Using guard pages around your allocations, you can detect overflows. Techniques like this can be a nice complement to external tools like Valgrind or AddressSanitizer. Between the simplified memory ownership, having tools to help detect errors, and tools to debug issues when they do occur, I can happily say I haven’t spent a lot of time debugging memory issues for years. :)</p>

<h2 id="common-allocators">Common Allocators</h2>

<p>Several of the common allocators you hear people talk about are so simple, you can describe them in a paragraph! (Though I’m going to cheat and use diagrams too.)</p>

<h3 id="1-slab-allocator">1) Slab Allocator</h3>

<p><img src="https://slembcke.github.io/images/SlabAllocator.svg" alt="Slab Allocator Diagram"></p>

<p>The collision pair example from Chipmunk2D is basically a slab allocator. The idea is that your allocator just needs to keep a list of large blocks of memory (slabs) that you have allocated, and break those into little fixed sized blocks of memory for your objects that you store in a linked list of free allocations. The trick is to use the allocations themselves as linked list nodes so you don’t have to waste any extra memory for tracking. Allocating memory becomes as fast as pushing or popping nodes onto a linked list, and you only have to talk to the OS when you run out of space in your existing slabs. Additionally, all of the memory is packed together which helps play nice with the CPU cache. As a bonus, you know for sure that you are packing small, short lived allocations together and minimizing fragmentation of your main memory space.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need to keep a pool of short lived allocations that are all the same size.</p>

<h3 id="2-linear-allocator">2) Linear Allocator</h3>

<p><img src="https://slembcke.github.io/images/LinearAllocator.svg" alt="Linear Allocator Diagram"></p>

<p>Linear allocators (sometimes called bump allocators) are one of the simplest and most useful custom allocators. The short version: Given a block of memory, start at the beginning and make allocations one after another. When you are done with all the allocations, free or reuse the block. Generally speaking you also need to deal with alignment, overflow, and out of memory issues, but none of that is particularly complicated. Linear allocators are great when you need scratch memory to build a temporary data structure, or otherwise know that all the data you are allocating has a finite lifespan. This works well when processing a user input event in a GUI, or a frame in a game. Not only does your data end up well packed for the CPU cache, but the actual cost of the allocation is just a tiny bit of arithmetic, and deallocation is basically free! The biggest downside of linear allocators is that you need to know the worst case memory usage up front.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need fast temporary memory with a finite lifespan.</p>

<h3 id="3-zone-allocator">3) Zone Allocator</h3>

<p><img src="https://slembcke.github.io/images/ZoneAllocator.svg" alt="Zone Allocator Diagram"></p>

<p>Zone allocators (sometimes called arena allocators) make linear allocators more flexible by relaxing the upfront memory allocation. Instead of a single block of memory, you make a series of linear allocators. Whenever one runs out of space, allocate another block and switch to it. Then all you need to do is keep a list of the blocks you allocate so they can be freed (or returned to a pool) when you are done with the zone.</p>

<p>Zone allocators are pretty simple to extend to be thread safe as well. Instead of a single linear allocator you can make one per thread as needed. Only the list of blocks shared by the zone’s linear allocators needs to be protected by a mutex.</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need fast temporary memory with a finite lifespan, but don’t know how much you’ll need.</p>

<h3 id="4-buddy-block-allocator">4) Buddy Block Allocator</h3>

<p>The buddy block allocator is the fanciest allocator I’ve personally implemented. It’s pretty generic, and is exactly the sort of thing I thought would be a waste of time all those years ago. On the other hand it’s not particularly complicated, and my own implementation is barely 200 sloc. The basic idea is that you start with a large block of memory that you want to split up, and when you make allocations you recursively break the block into halves until you have the size you need. Since sub-blocks are always broken into pairs (buddies), it’s easy to figure out the location of any given block’s buddy with a little math. When freeing a block, you can easily check if the buddy is free and join them back together into a larger block.</p>

<p>While I can’t succinctly describe the whole algorithm in a paragraph, there are plenty of articles on the internet if you want a clearer picture. Also, keep in mind that while this is a pretty generic algorithm that you really <em>could</em> replace malloc() with, you might want to have a pretty good idea of why you’d want to. Maybe you have some strong latency constraints (audio, graphics, etc), or maybe you are allocating something that isn’t regular memory (ex: Vulkan memory). I’ve only used my implementation in a real-time audio synthesizer, but it would have been fine without it too. It was for a hobby project, and it was fun. :)</p>

<p><strong>When to use it:</strong> When you need a general purpose allocator with predictable performance.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-bother-with-custom-allocators">Why not bother with custom allocators!</h2>

<p>Hopefully I’ve convinced somebody that custom allocators aren’t a terrible idea after all, and given them some terms to search for more information.</p>

<p>Happy allocating! :)</p>

<p>Isn’t it weird that we treat source code as text? That is, we have this extremely well-structured and strongly-typed object — the abstract syntax tree — that exists conceptually in our minds, and in actuality inside of our compiler, but for some reason we pretend it’s just a pile of bytes and edit it byte-by-byte rather than semantically?</p>
<p>When you stop and think about it, that’s like the stupidest idea ever. We as the authors don’t think of our code as bytes, nor does our interpreter or compiler. But instead we take the semantic understanding inside of our heads, serialize it into bytes, and then get the compiler to parse and rediscover the ideas inside our head. What a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the incredible <a href="https://totbwf.github.io/">TOTBWF</a> and my new Tactics Plugin for the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server">Haskell Language Server</a>, which will automatically and intelligently fill holes in your Haskell programs.</p>
<p>This blog post describes what a tactics engine is and why you want one, and is a good introduction to how in the hell we can automatically write your code for you.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re pair programming with a junior engineer. In the navigator seat, you’ll be guiding your partner through the implementation, guiding them through the high-level strokes and letting them actually do the coding part. In order to implement <code>foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b</code>, for example, the guidance you give your partner might be:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bind the function arguments</li>
<li>Case split on the <code>[a]</code> parameter</li>
<li>If it’s <code>[]</code>, do the obvious thing</li>
<li>Otherwise call your function and recurse.</li>
</ol>
<p>These instructions aren’t a real program by any means, but you might call them a “program sketch.” The hard part of programming (thinking about what to do) is captured here, but <em>actually doing it</em> is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>A tactics engine transforms a program sketch like the above into an actual program. Tactics free us from the tyranny of text editing and pedantic details, allowing us to work at a higher semantic level of programming.</p>
<p>Tactics correspond to semantic operations over our program. Much like how the primitive commands in text editors (delete to end of line, insert parentheses, etc) can be composed to refine the textual representation of one program into the textual representation of another, we can compose small tactics in order to build larger ideas.</p>
<p>As an example, consider how we can fill in the following hole:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>data</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Id</span> a</span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Id</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>  fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb1-5">  <span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Rather than writing this function all at once, we can instead build it, one idea at a time. The first step is obviously to bind function arguments (the <code>intros</code> tactic), which results in the refined expression:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’re left with a new hole, but this one is “smaller” than the old one; we’ve refined the previous hole, filling in some of its structure. As a result, the type of our new hole is <code>Id b</code>, and we now have both <code>fab :: a -&gt; b</code> and <code>ida :: Id a</code> in scope. We can simplify the hole further by now pattern matching on <code>ida</code> (the <code>destruct ida</code> tactic):</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The resulting hole still has type <code>Id b</code>, but we’ve now introduced <code>a :: a</code> in scope. Our next step is to build an <code>Id</code> value, which we can do by producing its data constructor (the <code>split</code> tactic):</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Again we’ve shrunk the problem — now our hole has type <code>b</code>. At this point we can call the <code>fab</code> function to produce a <code>b</code> (via the <code>apply fab</code> tactic):</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> (fab _)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All that’s left is a hole with type <code>a</code>. Fortunately, we have <code>a :: a</code> in scope, so we can just plop that in to the hole via the <code>assumption</code> tactic:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> b</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ida <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ida <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">  <span>Id</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Id</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And just like that, we’ve produced an implementation of our desired function! By thinking in terms of the semantic operations we’d like to perform at each hole (instead of how to manipulate the bytes of text), we’ve changed the level of abstraction at which we think about editing. The implications of this might not be immediately obvious, so let’s explore them together.</p>
<p>Let’s list the tactic steps we took to derive <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1">intros</span>
<span id="cb7-2">destruct ida</span>
<span id="cb7-3">split</span>
<span id="cb7-4">apply fab</span>
<span id="cb7-5">assumption</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Up to alpha renaming, this composition of tactics is sufficient to derive <code>fmap</code> for any sum or product type that doesn’t do anything “exciting” with its type variable. By running the same steps, we can implement <code>fmap</code> for any of the following types:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1">(a, b)</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>Either</span> a b</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>Maybe</span> a</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>Const</span> a b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s convince ourselves of this by quickly running through the derivation for <code>Maybe a</code>. We start again with <code>fmap</code> and its type:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After running <code>intros</code>:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then <code>destruct ma</code></p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> _</span>
<span id="cb11-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Applying <code>split</code> here is a little tricky; technically it will force us to try both <code>Nothing</code> and <code>Just _</code> at each hole in a weird sort of quantum superposition. Let’s ignore this detail for right now, and come back to it immediately after finishing the derivation. Assuming we pick the right data cons, after <code>split</code> our program looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb12-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we run <code>apply fab</code>. Because <code>Nothing</code> doesn’t take any arguments, it didn’t produce any holes, so we need look only at the <code>Just</code> case:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb13-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab _)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and finally we run <code>assumption</code> to fill in the hole:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> b</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb14-4">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Look at that! Even though it would require significantly different editing commands to write the syntax of these two functor instances, they are both descried by the same composition of tactics. This is what I mean by “semantic editing,” we’re moving the algorithm for producing functor instances out of our heads and reifying it into something the computer understands. In essence, by writing <code>fmap</code> once, we can teach the computer how to write it for us in the future.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that <code>split</code> gives us some issues here. Reading closely, you’ll notice that there is nothing in our tactics that say we need to <code>split</code> the same data constructor that we just <code>destruct</code>ed. In actuality there are four different, valid programs that can be produced by the above set of tactics:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-4"></span>
<span id="cb15-5"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-6">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-7">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab a)</span>
<span id="cb15-8"></span>
<span id="cb15-9"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-10">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> _</span>
<span id="cb15-11">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb15-12"></span>
<span id="cb15-13"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb15-14">  <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> _</span>
<span id="cb15-15">  <span>Just</span> a  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Choosing the “best” implementation of these possibilities is largely a matter of heuristics, which I plan to describe in a later post. For now, let’s just assume our tactics engine is smart enough to come up with the one you had in mind.</p>
<p>Of course, the real issue here is that nothing forces our <code>destruct</code> and <code>split</code> tactics to use the same data constructor. We can eliminate this ambiguity by noticing that in <code>fmap</code>, we’re not actually trying to destruct and then split, but instead we’re trying to implement a homomorphism (a structure-preserving function.) In order to preserve structure, we’d better map a data constructor to itself. So instead, let’s use the <code>homo</code> tactic instead of <code>destruct</code> and <code>split</code>. Our new tactics metaprogram for writing functor instances is thus:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">intros</span>
<span id="cb16-2">homo ida</span>
<span id="cb16-3">apply fab</span>
<span id="cb16-4">assumption</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This new version now can no longer generate any of the pathological <code>fmap</code> implementations for <code>Maybe</code>, as they are not structure preserving. We’re left only with the good implementation. Let’s do one more derivation, this time for <code>Either c a</code>. After <code>intros</code> and <code>homo eca</code>, we’re left with:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c b</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> eca <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb17-3">  <span>Left</span>  c <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Left</span> _</span>
<span id="cb17-4">  <span>Right</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> _</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the first time, we’re now left with <em>two</em> holes. The default behavior is for a tactic to apply to all holes (although there are combinators for “zipping” holes), meaning that the <code>apply fab</code> tactic will be run on both holes. For the <code>Left</code> case, our hole has type <code>c</code>, but <code>fab _</code> has type <code>b</code>, so this tactic <em>fails to apply here.</em> Tactic failure is per-hole, so we can still apply it to the other hole, resulting in:</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c b</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> eca <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3">  <span>Left</span>  c <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Left</span> _</span>
<span id="cb18-4">  <span>Right</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> (fab _)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And finally, <code>assumption</code> fills the hole with whatever would typecheck. In the first hole that’s <code>c</code>, and in the second it’s <code>a</code> as before.</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> c b</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>fmap</span> <span>=</span> \fab ma <span>-&gt;</span> <span>case</span> eca <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">  <span>Left</span>  c <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Left</span> c</span>
<span id="cb19-4">  <span>Right</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> (fab a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Amazing! Three different functor implementations, with different numbers of data constructors, type variables, and cardinalities. By programming at the level of tactics rather than bytes, we can ignore the superficial differences between these implementations, focusing instead on the fact that they’re all derived the same way.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post has given you some insight into what tactics are and why they’re valuable. In the next post we’ll look at how this stuff is implemented behind the scenes, and the difficulties we’ve had integrating it into the language server. Stay tuned!</p>

<h3>[ 2020-October-12 10:26 ]</h3>
<p>As part of investigating the durability provided by cloud systems, I wanted to make sure I understood the basics. I started by <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">reading the NVMe specification, to understand the guarantees provided by disks</a>. The summary is that you should assume your data is corrupt between when a write is issued until after a flush or force unit access write completes. However, most programs use system calls to write data. This article looks at the guarantees provided by the Linux file APIs. It seems like this should be simple: a program calls <code>write()</code> and after it completes, the data is durable. However, <code>write()</code> only copies data from the application into the kernel's cache in memory. To force the data to be durable you need to use some additional mechanism. This article is a messy collection of notes about what I've learned. (The really brief summary: use fdatasync or open with O_DSYNC.) For a better and clearer overview, see LWN's <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/457667/">Ensuring data reaches disk</a>, which walks from application code through to the disk.</p>


<h2>The semantics of write()</h2>

<p>The write system call is defined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">IEEE POSIX standard</a> as attempting to write data to a file descriptor. After it successfully returns, reads are required to return the bytes that were written, even when read or written by other processes or threads (<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/write.html#tag_16_685_08">POSIX standard write(); Rationale</a>). There is an addition note under <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_07">Thread Interactions with Regular File Operations</a> that says "If two threads each call one of these functions, each call shall either see all of the specified effects of the other call, or none of them." This suggests that all file I/O must effectively hold a lock.</p>

<p>Does that mean write is atomic? Technically, yes: future reads must return the entire contents of the write, or none of it. However, write is not required to be <em>complete</em>, and is allowed to only transfer <em>part</em> of the data. For example, we could have two threads, each appending 1024-bytes to a single file descriptor. It would be acceptable for the two writes to each only write a single byte. This is still "atomic", but also results in undesirable interleaved output. There is a great <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42442926/413438">StackOverflow answer with more details</a>.</p>


<h2>fsync/fdatasync</h2>

<p>The most straightforward way to get your data on disk is to call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fsync.2.html">fsync()</a>. It requests the operating system to transfer all modified blocks in cache to disk, along with all file metadata (e.g. access time, modification time, etc). In my opinion, that metadata is rarely useful, so you should use fdatasync unless you know you need the metadata. The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fdatasync.2.html">fdatasync man page</a> says it is required to flush as much metadata as necessary "for a subsequent data read to be handled correctly", which is what most applications care about.</p>

<p>One issue is this is not guaranteed to ensure you can <em>find</em> the file again. In particular, when you first create a file, you need to call fsync on the directory that contains it, otherwise it might not exist after a failure. The reason is basically that in UNIX, a file can exist in multiple directories due to hard links, so when you call fsync on a file, there is no way to tell which directories should be written out (<a href="https://www.quora.com/When-should-you-fsync-the-containing-directory-in-addition-to-the-file-itself">more details</a>). It appears that ext4 may actually <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/799807/">fsync the directory automatically, but that might not be true for other filesystems</a>.</p>

<p>The way this is implemented will vary depending on the file system. I used <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/blktrace.git/tree/README">blktrace</a> to examine what disk operations ext4 and xfs use. They both issue normal disk writes for both the file data and the file system journal, use a cache flush, then finish with a FUA write to the journal, probably to indicate the operation has committed. On disks that do not support FUA, this involves two cache flushes. My experiments show that fdatasync is slightly faster than fsync, and blktrace shows fdatasync tends to write a bit less data (ext4: 20 kiB for fsync vs 16 kiB for fdatasync). My experiments also show that xfs is slightly faster than ext4, and again blktrace shows it tends to flush less data (xfs: 4 kiB for fdatasync).</p>


<h2>fsync controversies</h2>

<p>In my professional career, I can remember three fsync-related controversies. The first, in 2008, was that Firefox 3's UI would hang when lots of files were being written. The problem is the UI used the SQLite database to save state, which provides strong durability guarantees by calling fsync after each commit. On the ext3 filesystem of the time, fsync wrote out <em>all</em> dirty pages on the system, rather than just the relevant file. This meant that clicking a button in Firefox could wait for many megabytes of data to be written on magnetic disks, which could take seconds. The solution, as I understand <a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/05/25/fsyncers-and-curveballs/">from a blog</a>, was to move many database commits to asynchronous background tasks. This means Firefox was previously using stronger durability guarantees than it needed, although the problem was made much worse by the ext3 filesystem.</p>

<p>The second controversy, in 2009, was that after a system crash, users of the new ext4 filesystem found many recently created files would have zero length, which did not happen with the older ext3 filesystem. In the previous controversy, ext3 was flushing too much data, which caused really slow fsync calls. To fix it, ext4 flushes only the relevant dirty pages to disk. For other files, it keeps them in memory for much longer to improve performance (defaulting to 30 seconds, configured with <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt">dirty_expire_centiseconds</a>; <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg68941.html">note</a>). This means after a crash, lots of data might be missing. The solution is to add fsyncs to applications that want to ensure data will survive crashes, since fsyncs are much more efficient with ext4. The downside is this still makes operations like installing software slower. For more details, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/322823/">LWN's article</a>, or <a href="https://thunk.org/tytso/blog/2009/03/12/delayed-allocation-and-the-zero-length-file-problem/">Ted Ts'o's explaination</a>.</p>

<p>The third controversy, in 2018, is that Postgres discovered that when fsync encounters an error, it can mark dirty pages as "clean", so future calls to fsync do nothing. This leaves modified pages in memory that are never written to disk. This is pretty catastrophic, since the application thinks some data has been written, but it has not. There are very few things an application can do in this rare case when fsync fails. Postgres and many other applications now crash when it happens. A paper titled <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/rebello">Can Applications Recover from fsync Failures?</a> published in USENIX ATC 2020 investigates the issue in detail. The best solution at the moment is to use Direct I/O with O_SYNC or O_DSYNC, which will report errors on specific write operations, but requires the application to manage buffers itself. For more details, see the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/752063/">LWN article</a> or the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Fsync_Errors">Postgres wiki page about fsync errors</a>.</p>


<h2>open with O_SYNC/O_DSYNC</h2>

<p>Back to system calls for durability. Another option is to use the O_SYNC or O_DSYNC options with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open() system call</a>. This causes every write to have the same semantics as a write followed by fsync/fdatasync, respectively. The POSIX specification calls this <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_373">Synchronized I/O File Integrity Completion and Data Integrity Completion</a>. The main advantage of this approach is that you need a single system call, instead of write followed by fdatasync. The biggest disadvantage is that all writes using that file descriptor will be synchronized, which may limit how the application code is structured.</p>


<h2>Direct I/O with O_DIRECT</h2>

<p>The open() system call has an O_DIRECT option which is intended to bypass the operating system's cache, and instead do I/O directly with the disk. This means in many cases, an application's write call will translate directly into a disk command. However, in general this is not a replacement for fsync or fdatasync, since the <a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/durability-nvme.html">disk itself is free to delay or cache those writes</a>. Even worse, there are <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Clarifying_Direct_IO%27s_Semantics">edge cases that mean O_DIRECT I/O falls back to traditional buffered I/O</a>. The easiest solution is to also use the O_DSYNC option to open, which means each write is effectively followed by fdatasync.</p>

<p>It turns out that XFS somewhat recently added a "fast path" for O_DIRECT|O_DSYNC writes. If you are overwriting blocks with O_DIRECT|O_DSYNC, XFS will issue a FUA write if the device supports it, rather than using a cache flush. I used blktrace to confirm this happens on my Linux 5.4/Ubuntu 20.04 system. This should be more efficient, since it writes the minimum amount of data to disk, and uses a single operation instead of a write followed by a cache flush. I found a link to the <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10250257/">kernel patch that implemented this in 2018</a>, which has some discussion about implementing this optimization for other filesystems, but as far as I know XFS is the only one that does.</p>


<h2>sync_file_range</h2>

<p>Linux also has <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sync_file_range.2.html">sync_file_range</a>, which can allow flushing <em>part</em> of a file to disk, rather than the entire file, and triggering an asynchronous flush, rather than waiting for it. However, the man page states that it is "extremely dangerous" and discourages its use. The best description of some of the differences and dangers with sync_file_range is <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2014/03/how-syncfilerange-really-works.html">Yoshinori Matsunobu's post about how it works</a>. Notably, it seems that RocksDB uses this to control when the kernel flushes dirty data to disk, and still uses fdatasync to ensure durability. It <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/search?q=sync_file_range">has some interesting comments in its source code</a>. For example, it appears that with zfs, the sync_file_range call does not actually flush data. Given my experience that code that is rarely used probably has bugs, I would recommend avoiding this system call without very good reasons.</p>


<h2>System calls for durable I/O</h2>

<p>My conclusion is there are basically three approaches for durable I/O. All of them require you to call fsync() on the containing directory when you first create a file.</p>

<ol>
<li>fdatasync or fsync after a write (prefer fdatasync).</li>
<li>write on a file descriptor opened with O_DSYNC or O_SYNC (prefer O_DSYNC).</li>
<li>pwritev2 with the RWF_DSYNC or RWF_SYNC flag (prefer RWF_DSYNC).</li>
</ol>


<h2>Some random performance observations</h2>

<p>I have not measured these carefully, and many of these differences are very small, which means they could be false, or are highly likely to change. These are roughly ordered from …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve always been suspicious of the idea of being attached to a company.</p><p>It could be because of the leftist spirit of my generation in France, or because of my readings during my student years, or because of my familial history (which saw way more self-employed, farmers, nurses or teachers than company employees), but I’ve never accepted the idea of giving even a tiny portion of my independence of mind to a company. When I was a student, I wasn’t dreaming about joining a company like Google, who seemed too sectarian to me, to rather prefer boring companies, where we only expect you to work well. Keeping a distance from my company was, I thought, the way to stay <em>who I am</em>, without being infected by an external force.</p><p>It doesn’t mean that I didn’t care about my job. I’ve always been involved in my work, being proactive in bringing new technologies, mentoring the other developers, helping the team to grow, but I was doing this just because I liked my job. I was not considering this as something important in my career, simply because I didn’t want too. To develop my career, I was spending a lot of time outside work reading technical books, doing toy projects, going to meetups, browsing Hacker News. I was finding here what my company was fundamentally unable to give me, and I was feeling holding my fate in my own hands. I thought it was the best recipe to end with a successful career, while remaining free and protected from the meanders of corporate culture (or corporate politics, actually).</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>First, most recruiters don’t care about your personal projects or how many meetups you went during the year.
What matters the most is your current company - and by that I mean the name of your current company. It was saddening me before, but now that I’m on the other side today, with a manager position, I better understand this. This is plain common sense. You can generally assume that a developer coming from a cutting-edge company has better chances to be a great developer than a developer coming from a Java 1.4 shop. He may not be smarter, but he has been hired by a company with a most demanding hiring process, and has been surrounded by some of the smartest developers.</p><p>Worse, having too many personal projects can raise a flag and be scary for the recruiter. When my entrepreneurial experience has been over, I was disappointed and somewhat regretful of some of our choices, but generally proud of everything we did and excited to share my story to recruiters. I was surprised to see that most of them were only asking questions about my previous experiences as an employee. My CTO experience was an anomaly, at best two lost years, at worst a sign that I was too independent, too individualistic, not a good team player. Only relatively small and ambitious startups, like the one I’m in today, were valuing this experience.<br>Today, I recommend not hiding your side projects, but to not displaying them as a primary part of your identity, to not scare the recruiter and let him feel that you have a secondary plan.</p><p>Secondly, I don’t think that multiplying the side projects is useful unless they are substantial.
Side projects that we consider futile, that we do just to get away from our daily work, don’t make us better in our job. The things that make us progress are the issues we want to avoid and that generally come only when your toy project has been transformed into a product and when you have to deal with users, production issues, and money (your money). Basically, all the things that no one wants to do on his free time. Even from a purely technical point of view, you will not really understand a library or a framework by just sticking to the tutorial or its basic features. You’ll have to dig into and to face its most painful aspects to deeply understand it.</p><p>Shallow side projects are useful to develop a first opinion about a technology that will need to be confirmed with a more elaborate project. I’d compare them to school.<br>When I was a teenager, I remember what we were saying about it: <em>it will never help us in our future job</em>. After all, how teachings about antiderivatives, Rimbaud’s poetry or Napoleonic wars could be useful for our future adult life? We were right. Most of what we learned is pretty useless today, whether you are a cook, a hairdresser or a developer.<br>But this formed a complete package that infuses our adult life. Junior school is great because you don’t learn to find a job. You’re at school to grow as a citizen, not to prepare to your future life, and actually you’re better not to think about your future if you don’t want to question yourself about the meaning of your existence. This is the same thing for side projects. See them as a way to discover a new topic and enlarge your horizon, not as something that you could action in your current position or to find a new job. Otherwise, you expose yourself to severe disillusions.</p><p>The best way to dig a new technology is to practice it in your daily job. You’ll spend seven hours a day on it and will quickly become infinitely more proficient than if you just barely used it on nights and weekends. You may tell me that we face a chicken or egg problem here. How to get a job where you’ll work on a really attractive technology if you never used it before? Well, instead of spending nights superficially learning this technology, spend your nights preparing interviews. Read “Cracking the code interview”, learn everything you need to know about algorithms and binary trees. As we all know, the interview process is broken. Instead of deploring it, take advantage of it.</p><p>I don’t want to make this blog post a rant against side projects. In fact, I’m advocating the exact opposite. Continue to do as many side projects as ever, code on nights and weekends if you want to, but don’t do them because you think they could be useful to you to get a new job. This is wrong. I know too many developers who are stuck into this pipe dream. This is an illusion and this leads to a waste of time and energy.</p><p>Don’t create a project just to prove that you know Vue.js, but use this weird technology that you saw yesterday on Hacker News and that intrigues you. Don’t think about what are the best (and boring) blog post topics that could expand your personal branding, but write poetry or a review of the last movie you saw. Create the apps, services, websites, or video games you want to use. These side-projects are truly great. They may not make your portfolio or your public image convincing for the next recruiter you’ll meet, but this is how you will be able to express all that you have in you and end up affirming yourself. At least, you should end having something meaningful to show, something to be proud about.</p><p>You want to feel free and have time for your projects? Focus your efforts on joining a great company. This will make your career considerably easier and will make you as free as you wanted to be initially. The link you’ll develop with your company will be a source of discomfort sometimes, but it will protect you from the never-ending competition on the job market. The satisfaction of seeing your career flourishing while you will use all your free time to do what you like (including… side projects) will give you a valuable peace of mind.<br>By trading a little bit of what you think is your independence, you’ll get the real one.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p><em>zheap</em> is a way to <strong>keep table bloat under control</strong> by implementing a new PostgreSQL storage engine capable of running <strong><code>UPDATE</code>-intense workloads</strong> more efficiently. The project was originally started by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EnterpriseDB</a>.</p>

<p>To make <em>zheap</em> ready for production, we are proud to announce that our partners at <a href="https://heroiclabs.com/">Heroic Labs</a> have committed to <strong>fund the development</strong> of <em>zheap</em> and <strong>release all code to the community</strong>. <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/">CYBERTEC</a> has decided to <strong>double the funding amount</strong>, and to put up additional expertise and manpower to move <em>zheap</em> forward.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>Table bloat describes the phenomenon of tables and / or indices growing in size, even if the amount of data stored in the database stays constant. If one wants to support transactions it is necessary not to overwrite data in case it is rolled back.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL copies rows on <code>UPDATE</code> and stores them in the same table. Stale rows are periodically garbage-collected by an automatic process called <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html">VACUUM</a>. Problems start to crop up in <code>UPDATE</code>-heavy workloads, as VACUUM might not always be able to keep up.</p>

<h3 id="how">How?</h3>

<p>CYBERTEC has started a <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/zheap-reinvented-postgresql-storage/">series of blog posts</a> that go into the design-goals of <em>zheap</em>.</p>

These conclusions are completely based on my own subjective experiences of working in Silicon Valley for 3 years, running a startup for 2 and freelancing for 5.</em></p><p>I get brought into a lot of projects where the engineering team had created user flows and user interfaces, then either pre launch through user testing or post launch through user feedback, the client discovered those designs were far too complex for their end users. So why do those engineers suck at design? They’re far smarter than me, they understand their domain much better than me, and they’ve been working on that specific problem for many months or years. In fact, it’s so rare for a good engineer to be a great UX designer that they're called ‘unicorns’.</p><p>One of the more obvious reasons is that because they’ve been working on the specific problem for so long they have blinders on, and can no longer view it from a 30,000 ft view. There might be emotional attachment to already existing solutions that were thought up months ago. But the reason I wanna mainly talk about is that engineers, developers, whatever you want to call them, function in a different way than the general population, who tend to be the end users. When engineers are developing products strictly for other engineers, like a Chrome extension for debugging code or some sort of command line tool for example, their UX is fantastic. This is where the idea of building something for yourself comes from. So that means they don’t actually suck at design.</p><p>But when they have to design something for someone whose mind doesn’t work like an engineer, it’s a different story. They feel like things are getting “dumbed down” too much, and that “obviously this makes sense”, when for their end user it does not. There is too much of a disconnect between their understanding and mental framework of technology compared with the common person, and a larger amount of empathy is needed to bridge that gap. And that amount of empathy is hard to fake. I imagine that it’s like when you’re trying to explain something technologically mundane in your world, say, Instagram Stories, to your grandma who can barely send email. Bridging that gap requires a larger amount of empathy and patience, not because your grandma is dumb, but because her mental framework of technology is quite different than yours.</p><p>So why is it that UX designers supposedly have the ability to bridge that gap with everyone? I think great UX designers just grew up naturally having much more empathy towards others and having a much better ability to place themselves in others shoes and see the world from their eyes. I would argue that generally speaking in the real world this is a burden, when others can’t empathize with you but all you can do is empathize with them… makes it really difficult to not take on other’s pain, to not be the one who bends their rules to accommodate others, to not have solid boundaries, to not be as defensive in arguments. But in the technology world, that allows for great user friendly designs.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p>Your car sits idle over <a href="http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html">95% of the time</a>.</p>
<p>Your guest bedroom is occupied&nbsp;one week out of every 52.</p>
<p>Your kids use the yard less than <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/04/backyards-overrated-outdoors-indoors/1613815/">40 minutes a week</a>.</p>
<p>Yet we consumers love to envision the maximum usage for a particular item – like a house or a car – then buy the item with a capacity high enough to accommodate our visions.&nbsp;It makes us feel prepared, it feeds our egos, and it feels as though we got more value for our money than if we’d bought something smaller.</p>
<p>We do this despite knowing that we won’t be boarding&nbsp;guests year ’round, driving groups of eight&nbsp;in our minivan, and hosting lavish backyard parties, nightly.</p>
<p>But rather than buy for peak usage, I prefer to stay flexible.</p>
<div id="attachment_810"><p><a href="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-810" src="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160415_152650new-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-810">The kids in front of the Modo minivan we book every couple weeks or so. Just $8 an hour!</p></div>
<p>I scale my solutions up and down in response to my needs at the time.</p>
<p>Friends visiting from out of town? I’ll pay for their hotel, so I can live in a smaller, cheaper, better located condo for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>I have to schlep a bunch of kids far away? I’ll get a <a href="http://modo.coop/">Modo minivan</a>, a local car share, for a few hours. Let someone else maintain that gorgeous van.</p>
<p>Need some outdoors time? Walk a couple blocks to a park. I’m not interested in mowing something I only use a couple hours a week.</p>
<p>When I tell people this, they&nbsp;usually&nbsp;recoil at the cost. “Hotels are expensive!” “You RENT a car?!” They see only the short term price&nbsp;of my solutions.</p>
<p>They don’t see the other 95% of the time. The time when I didn’t need and therefore didn’t own or maintain those items.&nbsp;It’s in that 95% that I rack up huge savings. I make that 95% work <em>for me</em>, not against me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they’re living further out to afford that guest bedroom and yard, driving the $50,000 8-seater minivan, and paying for 5% usage,&nbsp;100% of the time.</p>

But we can scale up to vehicles when needed too.</p></div>
<p>Not owning the high capacity solution also gives me huge flexibility. Do I need a two-seater car? Or a five-seater? Minivan, cargo van, sports car? I can access them all, only when I need them.</p>
<p>So what motivates&nbsp;people to plan for occasional peaks and idealized usage, rather than actual daily utilization?</p>
<p>Ego is part of it. A large SUV or huge house is still a sign of success to many. Your neighbours won’t congratulate you in your driveway for scaling up and&nbsp;down your transportation needs in a responsible, real-time fashion.</p>
<div id="attachment_797"><p><a href="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-797" src="http://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653-1024x768.jpg" alt="For daily kid hauling, nothing beats the bus for price, independence and level of engagement." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://5kids1condo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_20160406_073653-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-797">For daily kid hauling, nothing beats the bus for price, independence and level of engagement.</p></div>
<p>A mistaken sense of “value” is also at play. We’re often taught that “more is more,” up-selling ourselves to a larger house or car on the premise of “just in case.” It’s something we’ve all been guilty of at one time or another.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;next time a big decision comes up, try forgoing your ego and asking yourself if more really means more. Account for the hidden costs: longer commutes to a big house, higher&nbsp;expenses, more maintenance, etc. Try making a rational, needs-based decision. A decision&nbsp;based not on anticipated peaks, but on actual&nbsp;daily usage.</p>
<p><strong>In short, don’t pay for the 95% you won’t use.</strong></p>
<p>You’ll save a ton of money and gain a better quality of life.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Through work I have to deal with a pretty huge codebase, and run Pylint on it during our continuous integration process. It's always been a bit slow, but recently I also noticed that it was consuming a <em>lot</em> of memory, causing OOM failures if we tried to run it too much in parallel.</p>
<p>I decided to roll up my sleeves and figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly was consuming so much memory?</li>
<li>Is there a way to avoid doing this?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a log of how I went about these two questions, as future reference for when I do other profiling work in Python.</p>
<p>Looking at Pylint from the entrypoint(<code>pylint/__main__.py</code>), I end up digging downwards and finding the "quintessential" <code>for</code> loop that you would expect in a program that checks a bunch of files for errors:</p>
<pre><code>    def _check_files(self, get_ast, file_descrs):
            # in pylint/lint/pylinter.py
            with self._astroid_module_checker() as check_astroid_module:
                for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
                    self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
</code></pre>
<p>First I just threw in a <code>print("HI")</code> statement in there to confirm that this is indeed what's being run when I do <code>pylint my_code</code>, and that goes off without a hitch.</p>
<p>First is to try and figure out what's being held in memory, so I do a really basic "heap dump" with heapy to see if anything stands out</p>
<pre><code>        from guppy import hpy
        hp = hpy()
        i = 0
        for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
            self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
            i += 1
            if i % 10 == 0:
                print("HEAP")
                print(hp.heap())
            if i == 100:
                raise ValueError("Done")
</code></pre>
<p>My heap profiles end up being almost entirely "frame types" (which I was kind of expecting, for some reason), but also holding ont a bunch of tracebacks. Enough of these kinds of objects that I told myself "surely this is more than is needed".</p>
<pre><code>    Partition of a set of 2751394 objects. Total size = 436618350 bytes.
    Index  Count   %     Size   % Cumulative  % Kind (class / dict of class)
        0 429084  16 220007072  50 220007072  50 types.FrameType
        1 535810  19 30005360   7 250012432  57 types.TracebackType
        2 516282  19 29719488   7 279731920  64 tuple
        3 101904   4 29004928   7 308736848  71 set
        4 185568   7 21556360   5 330293208  76 dict (no owner)
        5 206170   7 16304240   4 346597448  79 list
        6 117531   4  9998322   2 356595770  82 str
        7  38582   1  9661040   2 366256810  84 dict of astroid.node_classes.Name
        8  76755   3  6754440   2 373011250  85 tokenize.TokenInfo
</code></pre>
<p>It's at this point that I discovered heapy's <a href="https://zhuyifei1999.github.io/guppy3/pbscreen.jpg">Profile Browser</a>, which seemed like a bit of a nicer way to look at this data</p>
<p>I switched up the heap mechanism to dump to a file every 10 iterations, then graph the entire runtime behaviour</p>
<pre><code>    for name, filepath, modname in file_descrs:
        self._check_file(get_ast, check_astroid_module, name, filepath, modname)
        i += 1
        if i % 10 == 0:
            hp.heap().stat.dump("/tmp/linting.stats")
        if i == 100:
            hp.pb("/tmp/linting.stats")
            raise ValueError("Done")
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following result, confirming that frames and tracebacks are a big deal in this run of Pylint:</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/browser-profile-1.png">
  <img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/browser-profile-1.png">
</a></p>
<p>My next step is to actually look at the frame objects. Because Python is reference coutned, things are held in memory because <em>something</em> is pointing at them, so I'm going to try and find out which one.</p>
<p>The wonderful <code>objgraph</code> library takes advantage of the Python memory manager to let you look at all objects still in memory, as well as lookup references to an object.</p>
<p>It's actually very amazing that you can do this. Just have an object reference and you can find everything <em>pointing towards</em> that reference (there's some asterisks around C extensions but close enough). This is just wonderful technology for debugging, and another thing that makes Python a joy to work with, thanks to how much of CPython's internals are exposed for these kinds of tools.</p>
<p>First I struggled to find objects because <code>objgraph.by_type('types.TracebackType')</code> wasn't finding any objects, despite me having records of having half a million of them. Turns out the name to use was <code>traceback</code>. Didn't quite nail down why...</p>
<p><code>random.choice(objgraph.by_type('traceback'))</code></p>
<p>Gives me a "random traceback". <code>objgraph.show_backrefs</code> will draw a graph of objects referencing this traceback. </p>
<p>So I put an <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code> into the for loop after 100 iterations instead of just raising an exception, and I started looking at random tracebacks </p>
<pre><code>def exclude(obj):
    return 'Pdb' in str(type(obj))

def f(depth=7):
    objgraph.show_backrefs([random.choice(objgraph.by_type('traceback'))],
                            max_depth=depth,
                            filter=lambda elt: not exclude(elt))
</code></pre>
<p>Originally I was just seeing a chain of tracebacks, so I went for a depth of 100 and....</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-stack.png">
 <img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-stack.png">
    </a>
  So a bunch of tracebacks referencing other tracebacks. Cool. So many of them were like this.</p>
<p>I ended up just trying a bunch and failing, so I went after a secondary target: the <code>frame</code> types. These also seemed suspicious to me, and whatI end up finding is something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-nest.png">
 <img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-nest.png">
 </a></p>
<p>So tracebacks are holding onto frames (hence some similar cardinality). It's all a big mess, but the frames were at least pointing to lines of code. And this made me realize something silly: <em>I had never bothered to actually look at the data using up so much memory</em>. I totally should have just looked at the traceback objects themselves.</p>
<p>So for this I ended up doing this in the most convoluted way possible, which is look at the addresses in the <code>objgraph</code> image dump, seeing the memory addresses, searching the web for "how do I get a Python object from its address" and ending up finding the neat trick that I had noted:</p>
<pre><code>ipdb&gt; import ctypes
ipdb&gt; ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object)
py_object(&lt;traceback object at 0x7f187d22b880&gt;)
ipdb&gt; ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object).value
&lt;traceback object at 0x7f187d22b880&gt;
ipdb&gt; my_tb = ctypes.cast(0x7f187d22b880, ctypes.py_object).value
ipdb&gt; traceback.print_tb(my_tb, limit=20)
</code></pre>
<p>You can just tell Python "hey look at this memory, it's definitely at least a python object" and it will work.</p>
<p>Later I realized I had references to these objects through <code>objgraph</code> and could just use that.</p>
<p>It looks like Astroid is building up tracebacks through exception handling code a bit all over the place. I feel like most "cool tricks" are gotten to by forgetting about the easy way to do something, so I won't complain too much.</p>
<p>The traceback itself had a bunch of lines going through Astroid, the AST parser backing Pylint. Progress! Astroid does seem like a program that might hold onto a lot of stuff in memory as its parsing files.</p>
<p>I look around and end up seeing the following line in <code>astroid/manager.py</code></p>
<pre><code>except Exception as ex:
    raise exceptions.AstroidImportError(
    "Loading {modname} failed with:\n{error}",
    modname=modname,
    path=found_spec.location,
) from ex
</code></pre>
<p>"Aha!" Itell myself. This is what I'm lookign for! Some sort of exception chain that would generate super long tracebacks. Plus it's file parsing so there's reccursion, etc... <code>raise thing from other_thing</code> would chain them together!</p>
<p>I remove this <code>from ex</code> and .... nothing. Memory usage is still basically the same, and the tracebacks are still here.</p>
<p>I remember that exceptions hold their local bindings in the tracebacks, so the <code>ex</code> is still accessible. It can't be garbage colleceted just yet! </p>
<p>I do a bunch of refactorings to try and remove the <code>except</code> block for the most part, at least to avoid the reference to <code>ex</code>. Again, nothing!</p>
<p>For the life of me I can't get these tracebacks to garbage collect, despite there being no references to them. At least I thought this was the remaining reference.</p>
<p>Really though, this was all a red herring. I don't know if this actually had anything to do with my memory leak, because at one point I started noticing that <strong>I had no evidence</strong> backing up this entire exception chaining theory. Just a bunch of hunches, plus half a million tracebacks. </p>
<p>I started just kind of randomly looking at tracebacks looking for any extra clues. I tried going up the chain of references by hand but was getting nowhere. </p>
<p>Then I had the revelation: these tracebacks are all stacked on top of each other, but there will be a traceback that is above all these other ones. There is a traceback that doesn't just have another traceback pointing to it! </p>
<p>the references were through the <code>tb_next</code> property, as a simple chain. So I decided to look for the tracebacks at the end of their respective chains:</p>
<p><code>bottom_tbs = [tb for tb in objgraph.by_type('traceback') if tb.tb_next is None]</code></p>
<p>There's something magical about one-lining your way through 500,000 stack traces to find the one you actually care about.</p>
<p>This led me to what I was actually looking for: the reason why Python really wanted to keep these objects around in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-filecache.png">
<img src="https://rtpg.co/files/pylint/traceback-filecache.png">
</a>
We had a file cache! </p>
<p>Basically Astroid will cache the results of loading a module, so that if some part of the code asks for the same module/file again, it can just provide the previous result. It will also reproduce the errors as well, by holding onto thrown exceptions.</p>
<p>This is where I made a bit of a judgement call. Caching the "error-ness" makes sense, but for me it's not at all worth holding onto the number of tracebacks our code is generating. </p>
<p>Instead I decided to throw away the exception, store a custom <code>Error</code> class, and then just re-building exceptions when they are asked for. The details can be found over at <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/pull/837">this PR</a>, though it's not super interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler">Way Cooler</a> is a Wayland compositor
that was written in Rust using <a href="https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc">wlc</a>. Since
<a href="https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/516">last April</a> I’ve been
rewriting it to use <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>. In order to do
that however I had to wrap the library so that it could be used in Rust. I
worked on <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs">wlroots-rs</a> and put Way Cooler
on the back burner for a long time. After over 1,000 commits I’m giving up on it.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-wlroots-rs-in-detail">Problems with wlroots-rs in detail</h2>

<h3 id="ownership-with-handles">Ownership with handles</h3>

<p>wlroots-rs was going to be the safe Rust wrapper for the very complicated
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots library</a>. wlroots implements large
parts of a Wayland compositor and provides pluggable modules that most
compositors will want.</p>

<p>The biggest problem when wrapping wlroots was defining the ownership model of
the objects that wlroots exposes. To demonstrate this I will focus on a single
resource that illustrates the problem: an output.</p>

<p>A Wayland “output” is the resource that represents a display device. Commonly
this means it handles a computer monitor. This resource could disappear at any
time in the life cycle of the application. This is easy enough to imagine: all
it takes is a yank of the display’s power cord and the monitor goes away. This
is basically the exact opposite of the Rust memory model. Rust likes to own
things and give compile-time defined borrows of that memory. This is runtime
lifetime management that must be managed in some way.</p>

<p>You cannot simply define it like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>output_c_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>wlr_output</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Forward all the calls to the c pointer</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If this was done then it would be possible to leak the memory using <code>Box::leak</code>
and say that an output will live forever – even though it can’t.</p>

<p>The simplest way to achieve this safely would be to use reference counted
pointers and expose only weak pointers. Here is a (fake) example of how this
could look:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This is a _very_ simple example for clarity.</span>
<span>// wlroots-rs is not implemented like this.</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>RealOutput</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lifeline</span><span>:</span> <span>Rc</span><span>&lt;*</span><span>mut</span> <span>wlr_output</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lifeline</span><span>:</span> <span>Weak</span><span>&lt;*</span><span>mut</span> <span>wlr_output</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Output</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>/// Changes the mode (resolution) of an output.</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>change_mode</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>Mode</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>output_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>lifeline</span><span>.upgrade</span><span>()</span><span>.ok_or</span><span>(())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
            <span>wlr_output_change_mode</span><span>(</span><span>output_ptr</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>.into</span><span>());</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This naive style implementation could work, however it would cause a lot of
branching code. Each call to wlroots will require a check to see if the handle
has been dropped, even though it almost certainly has not been dropped (it can
only be dropped between event callbacks, wlroots/Wayland is callback based).
This means there will be unnecessary paths (that are hopefully marked cold) that
either panic or return an error.</p>

<p>This is obviously not wanted so the next best thing is define a range where it
is safe to use the reference to the resource: i.e. we want to be able to define
a lifetime for a code block. This leads us to the <em>actual</em> design of wlroots-rs,
using handles (note that this <em>is</em> actual code):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// A non-owned reference counted handle to a resource.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// The resource could be destroyed at any time, it depends on the resource.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// For example an output is destroyed when its physical output is</span>
<span>/// "disconnected" on DRM. "disconnected" depends on the output (e.g. sometimes</span>
<span>/// turning it off counts as "disconnected").</span>
<span>/// However, when the backend is instead headless an output lives until it is</span>
<span>/// destroyed explicitly by the library user.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// Some resources are completely controlled by the user. For example although</span>
<span>/// you refer to a `Seat` with handles it is only destroyed when you call the</span>
<span>/// special destroy method on the seat handle.</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// Please refer to the specific resource documentation for a description of</span>
<span>/// the lifetime particular to that resource.</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The full implementation can be found
<a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/src/utils/handle.rs">here</a>,
its far too long and complicated to paste into a blog post.</p>

<p>This code is very complicated, which isn’t what you want for the defining
abstraction of your safe library. As far as I’m aware though it is correct. It’s
also incredibly ugly to use in practice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>some_wlroots_callback</span><span>(</span><span>output_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>OutputHandle</span><span>,</span>
                         <span>surface_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>SurfaceHandle</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>output_handle</span><span>.run</span><span>(|</span><span>output</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>surface_handle</span><span>.run</span><span>(|</span><span>surface</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// maybe some more nested layers...</span>
        <span>})</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
    <span>})</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To avoid this callback hell, I defined two macros to help: <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/src/macros.rs#L355">one normal
macro</a>
and a very complicated <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/wlroots-dehandle/src/lib.rs">procedural
macro</a>.
Here’s what the procedural macro looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This does the same thing as the above code, but nicer.</span>
<span>#[wlroots_dehandle]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>some_wlroots_callback</span><span>(</span><span>output_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>OutputHandle</span><span>,</span>
                         <span>surface_handle</span><span>:</span> <span>SurfaceHandle</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[dehandle]</span> <span>let</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>output</span><span>;</span>
    <span>#[dehandle]</span> <span>let</span> <span>surface</span> <span>=</span> <span>surface_handle</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This expands out the lines to use the non-proc macro, which in turn becomes the
callback hell mess. The only problem with this scheme is now that the control
flow is all wrong:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this is actual code I had to write (simplified)</span>
<span>for</span> <span>shell</span> <span>in</span> <span>mapped_shells</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[dehandle]</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>surface</span> <span>=</span> <span>shell</span><span>.surface</span><span>();</span>
    <span>// If not ready to render, don't render it yet</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>surface</span><span>.is_mapped</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// What we _want_ to write</span>
        <span>// break</span>

        <span>// What we have to write because this is actually in a callback...</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>// actually goes to the next shell in the mapped_shells...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this solution “works” but it’s not great. Ultimately it’s very confusing for
users. It was too confusing for <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/end-of-year-librem-5-update/">purism to get
working</a> (this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX5yVyLbLZE">video</a> was very painful for me to
watch - the library was unusable). <a href="https://github.com/buffet/kiwmi">Kiwmi</a>
initially tried using wlroots-rs but swiftly gave up and used wlroots itself.</p>

<h3 id="the-sheer-amount-of-api-to-wrap">The sheer amount of API to wrap</h3>

<p>Currently there is 11 <strong>THOUSAND</strong> lines of Rust in wlroots-rs. <em>All</em> of this
code is just wrapper code, it doesn’t do anything but memory management. This
isn’t just repeated code either, I defined a <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs/blob/91a18bd541a6ec565d6ef78d18ee5cc6a413f684/src/macros.rs#L201">very complicated and ugly
macro</a>
to try to make it easier.</p>

<p>This wrapper code doesn’t cover even half of the API surface of wlroots. It’s
exhausting writing wlroots-rs code, memory management is constantly on my mind
because that’s the whole purpose of the library. It’s a very boring problem and
it’s always at odds with usability - see the motivation for the escape from
callback hell described above.</p>

<p>To do all of this, and then go write Way Cooler, already a big undertaking, is too
much for me to commit to. When the benefit at the end of the day is just so I
don’t have to write C, that doesn’t really make it worth it. If I got this out
of the box by simply linking to the library, like I can in C++, then it would be
much more tenable.</p>

<p>I can always just use unsafe bindings to wlroots, just like I would with any
other language. However, the <em>entire point</em> of Rust is that it’s safe. Doing
that is not an option because at that point you lose the entire …</p></section></div></article></div></div></div>

<figcaption>"Competition with Windows and macOS makes Linux a better operating system."</figcaption></figure><p>The reasons I do not think Windows will be rebasing to a Linux kernel are as followed:</p><ol><li>The NT kernel in Windows offers a degree of backward compatibility, long-term support, and driver availability that Linux is just now approaching. It would cost millions of dollars to replicate these in Linux. Microsoft has plenty of paying customers to continue supporting Windows as-is, some for decades. Windows is not a drain on Microsoft that would justify the expense of rebasing to Linux for savings, as <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764">Raymond</a> has argued. <a href="https://www.arcanoae.com/">Lots</a> of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/">profitable</a> <a href="https://vmssoftware.com/">companies</a> <a href="https://www.xinuos.com/">exist</a> solely to service existing operating systems. Even if it came down to rebasing to Linux, it could result in an undesirable kernel monoculture. Competition with Windows and macOS makes Linux a better operating system. The more desirable outcome is that open source innovation continues spreading across and between <em>all</em> operating systems. That Windows and Linux open source contributors share the best of both ecosystems.</li><li>It is unclear if the Windows user space could even be rebased from NT to the Linux kernel and maintain the compatibility that Windows is known for, specifically what enterprise clients with mission-critical applications are paying to get. Windows does not have the same strict division between kernel space and user space that Linux does. The NT kernel has about 400 documented syscalls plus about 1700 documented Win32 API calls. That would be a huge amount of re-implementation to ensure precise compatibility that Windows developers and their tools expect. It goes beyond contributing some fixes to Wine. Linux only has 313 syscalls on amd64 and, even then, part of the reason Microsoft switched from a syscall translation layer in WSL 1 to a virtualized kernel in WSL 2 is because re-implementing the dozens of non-standard ways developers had come to exploit the Linux ABI was <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/4022">a pain in the ass</a>. It is one thing to provide a NT-related compatibility layer for <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2016/12/16/sql-server-on-linux-how-introduction/">SQL Server on Linux</a>, which Microsoft owns, it is another to guarantee it for millions of other developer's applications.</li><li>Microsoft has doubled down on Windows in recent years. Microsoft has invested in usability, new features, and performance improvements for Windows 10 that have paid off. These improvements, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/what-are-microsoft-precision-touchpad-drivers">collaborations with OEMs</a>, and the Surface <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/01/29/traditional-pcs-seeing-resurgence-after-7-years-of-decline.aspx">helped revitalize</a> a PC market that at one point <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/03/06/apple-google-microsoft-hewlett-packard-dell-ipad-iphone-android-ios-samsung-galaxy/1946325/">looked in danger of falling</a> to iPads and Chromebooks. Microsoft has been working hard to make Windows an excellent development platform, with projects like Windows Terminal, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">PowerToys</a>, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and Visual Studio 2019. The Insiders program is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-weve-got-10-million-insiders-testing-windows-10-to-keep-bugs-at-bay/">remarkably successful</a>. Windows powers most of the Surface device lineup, a key focus of Microsoft right now. Internal reorganizations in 2018 and <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/microsoft-brings-windows-ux-surface-teams-together-exec-panos-panay-latest-reorg/">2020</a> show that the future of the Surface and Windows are now inextricably linked. Windows powers the Xbox and we are in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-state-of-pc-gaming-in-2020/">resurgence</a> of mostly Windows-based PC gaming. Microsoft also has ideas for <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x">Windows 10X</a>, the next operating system concept following Windows 10 (that I think we will <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10x-out-box-experienced-shown-leaked-video">get in gradual pieces</a>), with future hardware like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-confirms-its-dual-screen-surface-neo-has-been-delayed">Surface Neo</a> in mind.</li><li>Microsoft does not have to rebase to Linux to stay relevant. Microsoft is aware of a changing device landscape after losing on Windows in mobile. They recognize a more diverse set of operating systems and platforms are powering the computing devices we use, which now includes Android, Ubuntu, iOS, macOS, Alexa, Chrome OS, and not just x86 but ARM. Microsoft has shown they are able to adapt by making relevant products and services available on those other platforms while simultaneously keeping their own platform, Windows, competitive in its traditional footholds. Microsoft is now driving innovation on Android in the mobile space, not just with ported Office apps, but a home screen launcher, and now the Surface Duo. On Ubuntu, they offer their tools that would make sense for Linux workstations, such as Code, .NET, Azure tools, Teams, PowerShell, Sysinternals for Linux, and soon Edge, which comes with Microsoft's custom <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide">web dev tools</a>. Do you want to run Ubuntu on Azure? Microsoft has you covered and works closely with Canonical to make that a wonderful experience. </li></ol><p>The much more interesting question is not whether Microsoft is planning to rebase Windows to Linux, but how far Windows will go on open source. We are already seeing components like <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal">Windows Terminal</a>, PowerToys, and other Windows <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/">components</a> either begin life as or go open source. The more logical and realistic goal here is a continued opening of Windows components and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WinDev">Windows development</a> process, even beyond the Insiders program, in a way that benefits other operating systems.</p><p>After all, Windows has already adopted the Ubuntu release cadence, of six-month releases in April and October with set releases getting extended support. Windows 2004 and Ubuntu 20.04 landed within days of each other. I kid.</p><p>Raymond is correct in one key part of his blog. I do think the era of the desktop OS wars is ending. We are entering a new era where your high-end workstation will run multiple operating systems simultaneously, like runtimes, and not necessarily all locally. The choice will not really be Windows or Linux, it will be whether you boot Hyper-V or KVM first, and Windows and Ubuntu stacks will be tuned to run well on the other. Microsoft contributes patches to the Linux kernel to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-these-patches-aim-to-make-linux-run-as-root-partition-on-hyper-v/">run Linux well on Hyper-V</a> and tweaks Windows to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/03/11/windows_10_on_kvm/">play nicely on KVM</a>.</p><p>The best parts of Ubuntu will come to Windows and the best open source parts of Windows will come to Ubuntu, thanks to an increasing trend <a href="https://boxofcables.dev/microsoft-and-open-source-an-unofficial-timeline/">towards open source across Microsoft</a>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out this sneak preview of our work on adding Linux GUI application support to WSL! <a href="https://t.co/lcx4WWwxTo">pic.twitter.com/lcx4WWwxTo</a></p>— Craig Loewen (@craigaloewen) <a href="https://twitter.com/craigaloewen/status/1308452901266751488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The key take-away though is that <a href="https://boxofcables.dev/microsoft-and-open-source-an-unofficial-timeline/">open source has won</a>. And Raymond can be proud of helping to <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html">articulate the case</a> for the open source development model when he did.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLZRY3uLJ4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Excerpt from 'Revolution OS'&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Neither Windows nor Ubuntu are going anywhere.

                    <p>In the last post, I’ve explained how the speed of symbol manipulation <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/writing-as-a-tool-for-thought/">augments our intellect</a>. Today, I will describe an interface I’ve designed that increased my typing speed 3x, changed how I plan projects, and helped me develop a growth mindset.</p><p>Here’s what’s coming:</p><ul><li>How QWERTY was invented</li><li>Why Dvorak keyboard failed despite being more efficient</li><li>The sausage theory of innovation</li><li>How to type 3x faster</li><li>How shortcuts help to discover new knowledge, plan projects in minutes and develop a growth mindset</li><li>What comes after shortcuts</li></ul><p>You can find references at the end of the post.</p><p>I hope you’ll enjoy your reading.</p><hr><h2 id="how-qwerty-was-invented"><strong><strong>How QWERTY was invented</strong></strong></h2><p>Most people type one symbol at a time.</p><p>That’s because our keyboard is designed that way. No matter how much time you spend in the gym, weightlifting your left thumb, there’s an apparent speed limit beyond which you can’t go. You’ve only got ten fingers.</p><p>But very few people know <em>why</em> the keyboard is designed that way. And if we want to go beyond the speed of the keyboard, we need to first understand how we ended up here.</p><p>So let’s travel back in time.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94fd314f-be54-46cf-9f08-759ae1975b7d_1500x1786.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>On July 1, 1874, the first typewriter hit the market.</p><p>You’re probably now scratching the back of your head and thinking:</p><p><em>“Well, I’ve seen this keyboard somewhere..”</em></p><p>That’s right. The very first “Type-Writer,” designed by Christopher Sholes 146 years ago, used the exact same QWERTY keyboard that‘s in front of you.</p><p>Here’s how it worked.</p><p>His machine had a mechanism with characters at the end of a bar. When a key was struck, a linkage would swing the bar into a tape coated with ink. And when the character hit the tape, the impression of the character was transferred onto the paper.</p><p>The problem was that bars were colliding with each other and jamming. That’s why Christopher arranged the keys with the most common letters in hard to reach spots. He decided to slow typists down to prevent bars from jamming.</p><p>But that’s excusable. Christopher couldn’t have imagined one-third of humankind using his invention every day for hours. He lived 150 years ago when typing was not even a skill because typewriters didn’t exist.</p><p>And for the next 68 years after the “Type-Writer” hit the market, nobody cared about the speed.</p><p>But then one American professor tried to go faster.</p><h2 id="why-dvorak-keyboard-failed-despite-being-more-efficient"><strong><strong>Why Dvorak keyboard failed despite being more efficient</strong></strong></h2><p>By the 1930s, the typewriters started getting traction.</p><p>The Underwood typewriter was selling like hotcakes. They reached 5 million units sold by 1939, and that was just the beginning.</p><p>On May 12th, 1936, August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William, submitted a patent for a better-designed keyboard that decreased typing errors, advanced typing speed, and lessened typist fatigue.</p><p>Here’s how it looked:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7358b134-c94b-42d2-b51b-ceb79676f87a_1232x723.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Their idea was to minimize the distance traveled by the fingers. To do that, August placed all the most commonly used letters in the home row—so that your fingers don’t have to move at all to hit these keys.</p><p>August and William also improved how vowels and consonants are located. They put all the vowels to be used by the left hand and made the right hand to manipulate only consonants. This enabled at least 2x speed improvement as there are very few words in the English language that can be typed with only one hand on the Dvorak keyboard (for the curious, the two are “papaya” and “opaque”).</p><p>Below you can see how much work each of the fingers does when typing on Dvorak instead of QWERTY:</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d6b9df3-d665-43a4-bbd7-8cdf5910d6cb_599x409.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>But Dvorak’s keyboard never took off.</p><p>The timing was terrible. Amid the Great Depression, most companies didn’t have the cash to buy new typewriters. And when World War II started, many typewriter plants shut down manufacturing of all typewriters—including ones with Dvorak layouts.</p><p>But the most important reason was psychological.</p><p>Despite Dvorak-trained typists getting banned from typing contests for “unfair advantage,” the QWERTY layout got deep into people’s minds as “normal.” And as soon as something gets “normal,” we forget <em>why</em> we do the thing in the first place.</p><p>I call it the sausage theory.</p><h2 id="the-sausage-theory-of-innovation"><strong>The sausage theory of innovation</strong></h2><p>Here’s how the story goes.</p><p><em>The daughter-in-law is cooking dinner.

When you type a symbol, i.e., “rr” or “wd,” and press a space bar, the system transforms your input into “remember” or “would be” accordingly. You can set up these pairs in Settings/Keyboard/Text Replacement.</p><p>But it’s not only the speed that matters:</p><ul><li><em>Shortcuts work on your iPhone.</em> As you spend 2-4h a day with your iPhone and type at least a few times slower, it’s useful to have shortcuts to speed up your input process.</li><li><em>Shortcuts take care of apostrophes.</em> You can have a “dont” shortcut that turns into “don’t.” This removes the necessity to press the apostrophe key at all.</li><li><em>Shortcuts prevent typos.</em> Typos come from the word type, which means pressing keys one after another. When you do shortcuts, you don’t type. And if you don’t type, then you don’t have typos.</li><li><em>Shortcuts simplify blind typing.</em> Getting all eleven symbols of the word “progressive” right when staring at a screen requires deliberate practice and exceptional motor skills. But if you type two symbols, “pg,” instead of eleven, you will make fewer errors.</li><li><em>Shortcuts let you instantly look up relevant information.</em> If you have an iPad with a keyboard, you can look up stuff from Notes and other apps by pressing Cmd+Space and hitting your shortcut. Here’s how it works:</li></ul><figure><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe06b0035-b3f8-4979-9bc2-9aef3ace58ed_600x450.gif" alt=""></figure><ul><li><em>Shortcuts speed up your handwriting.</em> When you start using shortcuts extensively, you’ll notice that you also use them in handwriting. This happens because you remember the meaning behind the symbol. And as handwriting is even slower than typing on a 146-year-old keyboard, this yields enormous speed benefits compared to scribbling full words and sentences.</li><li><em>Shortcuts speed up your thinking.</em> Inevitably, you will start thinking in shortcuts as well. Thoughts such as “Can I TTS this OL?” (“Can I use my three three screens writing method for this essay outline?”) begin to pop up.</li></ul><p>I can speculate that after three years of using shortcuts every single day for 5-10 hours, my thought process became significantly faster. That’s not only because of smaller symbols but also because shortcuts compress knowledge. They serve as dynamic pointers to the territory in my brain where the meaning is stored.</p><p>This means that I’m climbing up the ladder of information just like a chess player does when he progresses from being an amateur to a grandmaster.</p><p>The between the two is that an amateur calculates moves of individual figures on the board, and the grandmaster can play blind chess with ten people because he operates different information units. The grandmaster thinks not only in combinations and positions but even in entire games.</p><hr><p>Here’s how to integrate shortcuts into your workflow:</p><ul><li><em>Go bottoms-up.</em> Don’t just download 300 most popular English words but make shortcuts based on your unique needs. This means,</li><li><em>Look for big words.</em> You must become the Sherlock of your own typing. Whenever you catch a big word that you type often, go ahead and set up a shortcut for it. The bigger the word, the more benefit you get. For example, you can take the word “progressive” and turn it into a “pg” shortcut. This reduces the number of symbols you need to type 5x and …</li></ul></div></section></article></div></div></div>

            <p>The era of USB-C has come. The other day I threw all other cables into a box, and bought a set of USB-C to USB-C, Lightning, and microUSB cables. USB-C chargers around the house, USB-C PD power bank, even a nice small USB-C dock that works with the Nintendo Switch if the charger can do the right voltage. It's glorious.</p><p>Only one thing won't charge with USB-C, my awfully cheap ($190 for 4GB of RAM) Samsung Chromebook 3, a machine I use when I want the extra security of the Chrome OS platform. Instead, this laptop charges from an old-school 12V barrel connector, forcing me to carry around an extra brick. 😢</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----1.jpeg" alt="side view of the laptop with round charging connector"></figure><p>USB traditionally delivers 5V of power, but with the introduction of the USB Power Delivery standard, devices can negotiate higher voltages with capable power bricks. Indeed, 12V is an option, and at least a couple of my chargers support it.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----3.jpeg" alt="USB charger with 12V marking amongst others"></figure><p>It should be possible to hack together a USB-C charger for my cheap Chromebook!</p><p>What we need is called a "USB-C PD trigger", a little board that negotiates a specific PD voltage with a charger. There are a few variants, including ones with a button to select the voltage, but the most common one is a tiny board with a female USB-C connector called ZYPDS.</p><p>They are so cheap that I suspect the reason the laptops don't come with them is that 1) it requires a charger that can deliver that specific voltage, and people are already confused enough by USB-C and 2) the USB-C charger side is probably more expensive.</p><p>They usually support 15V/20V (selected by soldering a bridge), and while I suspect 15V would have worked too, I found one on eBay claiming 9V/12V. It has the same model name, but a different PCB color. Perfect!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-18-at-15.39.38.png" alt="an order for a blue 9V/12V ZYPDS for $4.42"></figure><p>This thing is small enough to fit in a cable (or even in the laptop, but I wanted to keep this as uninvasive as possible) so I also got a short cable with a barrel connector, and some heat shrink tubing.</p><p>When it arrived it was already configured for 12V, and delivered more or less on the spot.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----7.jpeg" alt="multimeter connected to the ZYPDS showing 12.17V"></figure><p>The only tricky thing was figuring out the polarity of the cable and the connector. I learned that the polarity of the connector is the marking on the charger that looks a little like <code>⊖--Ｃ●--⊕</code>, and commonly the outer surface of the barrel is the negative. I figured out which wire connected to the outer surface with the multimeter continuity mode.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----8.jpeg" alt="multimeter connected to the barrel connector and a wire from the cable"></figure><p>A mediocre soldering job later I had a short adaptor from USB-C to a barrel connector.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----9-1.jpeg" alt="ZYPDS with two wires soldered to the connector pads"></figure><p>And it successfully charges the laptop!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----11.jpeg" alt="the adaptor connected to a charging laptop"></figure><p>The only snag was that the barrel connector I got wasn't a perfect fit for the laptop, so it would lose connection if not pulled downwards. Knowing the setup worked, I just cut the stock charger and used its connector instead. It was more annoying to solder because it's a concentric cable, but it works perfectly.</p><p>With the heat shrink tubing on it doesn't even look that bad, and definitely beats carrying an extra charger around! (By the way, heat shrink tubing is amazing.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.filippo.io/content/images/2020/04/zypds----2.jpeg" alt="the adaptor charging a laptop"></figure><p>For more hacks, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Overloading by argument types is a pretty straightforward feature of many imperative languages.
However, most of them don’t support overloading by return types.
In particular, C++ does not.
For example, <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ddWcE8">clang complains</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>4</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span> <span>that</span> <span>differ</span> <span>only</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>return</span> <span>type</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>be</span> <span>overloaded</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>~~~~</span> <span>^</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>3</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>previous</span> <span>declaration</span> <span>is</span> <span>here</span>
<span>int</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>~~~</span> <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So… what if I told you we actually <em>can</em> overload by return type in C++?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>By a slight misuse of user-defined conversion operators.</p>

<h2 id="a-proof-of-concept">A Proof-of-Concept</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cast_operator">Conversion operators can be user-defined</a> in C++.
They allow us to add custom implicit or explicit conversion to our types.
These conversions themselves can also be overloaded, which leads us to a simple prototype:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"7"</span><span>};</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>"true"</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://godbolt.org/z/f3chze">Looking at godbolt</a>, this compiles and calls the desired conversion operators.
An important point to note here is that the compiler needs to know the <em>target</em> type for the conversion.
Thus, <code>auto i = to_string_t{"7"};</code> does not work as intended.
<code>i</code> will be of type <code>to_string_t</code> and not <code>int</code>.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-and-usage">Packaging and Usage</h2>

<p>We can achieve the original goal of an overloaded function by simply returning <code>to_string_t</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>

<span>int</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>bool</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, one can adhere to <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/">almost always auto</a> and write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>));</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>bool</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This technique also works when calling other functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>

<span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"false"</span><span>),</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"0"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And even interacts properly with more complex, potentially templated objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vec</span><span>;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>map</span><span>;</span>

<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>push_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"11"</span><span>));</span>
<span>map</span><span>[</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>)]</span> <span>=</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>);</span>
<span>vec</span><span>.</span><span>emplace_back</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"5"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back"><code>emplace_back</code> is templated</a> and internally constructs an <code>int</code> from our <code>to_string_t</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>if (cond)</code> tries to convert <code>cond</code> to <code>bool</code> and thus also works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>on_true</span><span>();</span>
<span>else</span>
    <span>on_false</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These examples can be seen in action <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/1x5de4">at godbolt</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-it-doesnt-work">Where It Doesn’t Work</h2>

<p>While we can achieve overloading by return type in many cases using the conversion operator technique, it doesn’t always apply.
As previously mentioned, the compiler needs to know the target type to choose the proper conversion operator and will not convert unless forced to.
We already saw the simplest case where no conversion is applied:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"7"</span><span>);</span>
<span>// decltype(i) is to_string_t, not int</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another problematic case arises when paired with normal overloading that leads to ambiguities:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>
<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>

<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"true"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which results in:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>error:</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>is</span> <span>ambiguous</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>bool</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, this means that <code>std::cout &lt;&lt; from_string("2") &lt;&lt; std::endl;</code> does not work.
(The error message for that is slightly ghastly as we have at least 16 candidate overloads.)</p>

<p>Finally, only one user-defined conversion can be applied implicitly, so the following <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Gxq1rb">doesn’t work</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>bar</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>

<span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The compiler only tries to directly convert <code>to_string_t</code> to <code>bar</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>22</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>matching</span> <span>function</span> <span>for</span> <span>call</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>test_bar</span><span>'</span>
    <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>"3"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>^~~~~~~~</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>source</span><span>&gt;:</span><span>18</span><span>:</span><span>6</span><span>:</span> <span>note</span><span>:</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>function</span> <span>not</span> <span>viable</span><span>:</span> <span>no</span> <span>known</span> <span>conversion</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>to_string_t</span><span>'</span> <span>to</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span> <span>for</span> <span>1s</span><span>t</span> <span>argument</span>
<span>void</span> <span>test_bar</span><span>(</span><span>bar</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
     <span>^</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All these cases can be resolved by explicitly adding a cast to the desired type, e.g. <code>int(to_string("10"))</code>.</p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>One important aspect of normal function overloading in C++ is the extensibility of the overload set.
Independent authors and libraries can add to the same overload set simply by providing a function with the proper name in the same namespace.
We might also add to the overload set via <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup</a>, though if this should be considered feature or bug is slightly controversial.</p>

<p>In its base form, our conversion operator approach is not extensible.
User-defined conversion functions must be member functions and we cannot add members to other classes post-hoc.
Thus, if our library defines</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>operator</span> <span>int</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span>  <span>// int  from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>bool</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span><span>;</span> <span>// bool from_string(std::string_view s);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then this means “overload for return types <code>int</code> and <code>bool</code>” and other libraries / files cannot add to that.</p>

<p>There is a way to fix this and add extensibility.
This will add some implementation complexity and for more specialized use cases, extensibility might not actually be desired.
However, I would argue that <code>from_string</code> should be designed with extensibility in mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the rest of this section focuses more on metaprogramming and API design than the return-type overloading.
You can skip to the next section to see the final version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution here is that conversion functions can be templated.
We will use that to delegate the conversion to a template specialization, which is then properly extensible:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_t</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>

    <span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>operator</span> <span>T</span><span>()</span> <span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>to_string_t</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>to_string_t</span><span>{</span><span>s</span><span>};</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The conversion in <code>to_string_t</code> is now templated and always calls <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string(s)</code>.
<code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;</code> is a class template that is specialized for all supported conversions.
Should a non-supported conversion be called, the <a href="https://artificial-mind.net/blog/2020/10/03/always-false"><code>always_false&lt;T&gt;</code> produces a nice(-ish) error message</a>.
We can now add our supported conversions via:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>int</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>bool</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>bool</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly, other authors or the end user can add conversions for custom types.
Sometimes, it is useful to conditionally add conversions.
For example <code>my_range&lt;T&gt;</code> might only be supported if <code>T</code> itself supports <code>from_string</code>.
Thus, it is customary to add a second template argument to the base template:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>class</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span> 
<span>{</span>
    <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>always_false</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>"conversion to T not supported"</span><span>);</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This enables our imaginary end user to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>enable_if_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>my_range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>// e.g. "[1, 2, 3]"</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The partial specialization is only “active”, if <code>T</code> itself satisfies <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code>.
(This, of course, is an example of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae">SFINAE</a>).</p>

<p>Such a <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> might look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span>
    <span>to_string_impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>from_string</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>declval</span><span>&lt;</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span><span>&gt;</span><span>()),</span> 
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>true_type</span><span>{});</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>false_type</span> <span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>);</span>

<span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>constexpr</span> <span>bool</span> <span>has_from_string</span> <span>=</span> <span>decltype</span><span>(</span><span>impl_has_from_string</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span><span>::</span><span>value</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we use <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae#Expression_SFINAE">Expression SFINAE</a> to disable the first <code>impl_has_from_string</code> overload if <code>to_string_impl&lt;T&gt;::from_string</code> does not exist.
<code>impl_has_from_string</code> itself is overloaded on <code>int</code> and <code>char</code> and called via <code>impl_has_from_string&lt;T&gt;(0)</code>.
This is a cheap way to say “try the <code>int</code> overload first and if it doesn’t apply, take the <code>char</code> overload”.
However, if we try to check <code>has_from_string&lt;T&gt;</code> for some type that has no <code>from_string</code>, we trigger the <code>static_assert(always_false&lt;T&gt;);</code> in the base template.
Thus, we move the <code>static_assert</code> to <code>to_string_t::operator T()</code> (see next section).</p>

<p>Note that the templated <code>to_string_impl</code> class is not the only option.
We could also use <a href="https://arne-mertz.de/2016/10/tag-dispatch/">tag dispatch</a> or even normal overloading, e.g. by delegating to (a user-extensible) <code>void convert_to(std::string_view s, T&amp; v)</code> that is overloaded on the second parameter.</p>

<h2 id="final-version">Final Version</h2>

Your mad scientist of a boss begins dragging you out of bed by the ankle. He simultaneously explains between belches that the FBI contacted him. They found his recently-developed Szechuan sauce recipe on the dark web. As you careen past the door frame you are able to grab your incident response “Go-Bag”. Inside is your trusty incident thumb drive and laptop.</p>
<p>Resources for getting started will be provided at the <em><span>bottom of the post</span></em>. <em><span>Additionally</span><span>, i</span><span>ndividual articles on working through the artifacts and solving the case will be posted in the coming weeks!</span></em> So be sure to check back soon.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This lab is for learning and practicing forensics obviously! We will also be providing training for free through a series of upcoming posts on how to solve the case!</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Experienced digital forensics Jedi Masters who want a fun case as well as aspiring forensics folks who want to learn and practice.</p>
<p>Teachers, Professors, Mentors, and Students are welcome to use these materials so long as credit is given to this site and its authors.</p>
<h3>Game-isms</h3>
<p>With training in mind, there are intentional (not to mention unintentional) mistakes in the data. Consequently, the timelines are sometimes compressed. For example, the time between the victim’s notification and when someone acquired the images does not make sense in the real world. Likewise, some of the adversary activities are stealthy, funny, or enable training efforts. However, the attack mirrors real-world adversary tactics, techniques, tools, and procedures. Consequently, it will support training and real-world incident preparedness.</p>

<p>Sure. All the systems were loc-<em>bellllch</em>-ated in 10.42 something something</p>
<p><strong>Were there any other systems or files you are concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, certainly. Morty is ramble <em>belllch</em> rambling on about something he might have had on there. Also, there was a secret about Be<em>belllech</em> …. Beth on the server. So if you find it, and YOU TELL ANYBODY I WILL KILL YOU!</p>
<p>(The threat here matches a character from a popular cartoon character and not any real threat so stay calm).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This incident occurred at an organization located in Colorado in September. So, this places the incident at UTC -6. Keep this in mind when looking at the output of various tools.</p>

<p><strong>The questions here are not a full example of what to ask during a breach.</strong> It’s part of the training scenario as much as anything else here. It’s also a decent starting point to your investigation would be going through the questions for the exercise and trying to answer those and use them as pivots.</p>
<h3>Potential Questions You May Have</h3>
<p><strong>Why (outdated) Windows 2012?</strong></p>
<p>Its end of life isn’t until 2023 and plenty of people still use it. In fact, investigations reveal that even Windows 2008r2 shows high usage despite an End of Life date of January 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>This will contrast nicely with 2012 for the Memory Forensics as it uses compressed memory. There will also be a difference in Disk Artifacts to explore between the two.</p>
<p><strong>I Don’t Know Forensics! Where do I start?</strong></p>
<p>That’s specifically the point of this training set! We will teach you how to approach this investigation, how to set-up your environment, analyze artifacts, and then to generate a great report!</p>
<h3>The Artifacts</h3>
<p>Separate posts will start appearing soon on how to approach these artifacts, and how to answer the questions above.</p>
<h4>Estimated Difficulty Levels:</h4>
<p><strong>Nightmare</strong> – Disk Image Only</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-Violence</strong> – Disk and Memory</p>
<p><strong>Hurt Me Plenty</strong> – Disk, Memory, and Autoruns</p>
<p><strong>I’m Too Young to Die</strong> – Disk, Memory, Autoruns, and PCAPS.</p>
<p>Also, for a fun twist, try and solve as much of the case as you can without the artifacts from the Desktop.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>To get the E01’s you may need to use Firefox in a Private Window, hit the back button, select the file, and hit Download.</strong></p>
<p>However, if you are worried about storage and bandwidth ditch the <code>protected files</code> and the <code>pagefiles</code> for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re trying to get into game development as a Software Engineer, finding
learning materials with the right level of context can be challenging. You’ll
likely face a choice between following materials introducing you to basic C# and
OOP concepts while also describing Unity concepts, or starting with advanced
tutorials and be left to figure out the core concepts deductively.</p><p>To fill that gap, I’m writing a series called
<strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>. This is
the first piece, and I’ll be releasing additional installments over the next few
weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">make sure to subscribe</a> for updates. The
series is intended for folks already comfortable with programming and software
architecture, especially those who learn best as I do: starting with first
principles and working your way upwards.</p><hr><p>I started my programming journey around 17 years ago by picking up
<a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a>. Countless hours spent coding
little games and tools led me to a bigger passion for programming. Eventually, I
was at a point where I focused mainly on Software Engineering. From my peers, I
know this is quite a common path that many of us took to find programming.</p><p>Yet the game development scene has changed significantly from those days. When I
went to pick up Unity after a long absence from game development, I was mostly
interested in understanding the basic concepts: what are the fundamental
building blocks of a game? What do I need to know about how these building
blocks are represented in memory or on disk? How is idiomatic code organized?
What patterns are preferred?</p><p>In the first article in the series, we’ll focus on those first two questions.</p><h2 id="scene">Scenes</h2><p>A <strong>Scene</strong> is the largest unit of organizing your objects in-memory. Scenes
contain the objects making up your game.</p><p>In basic use, one scene represents a <strong>single level</strong> in your game, where one
scene is loaded at any given point. In more “advanced” use, you can have two or
more active scenes at a time. Scenes can be loaded additively and unloaded <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
Having multiple scenes loaded during gameplay comes especially handy when
building a massive world; keeping far-away areas on-disk rather than in-memory
will help you stay within your performance budget.</p><div><figure><p><span>

decide it organizationally makes sense to put all your “environment” (e.g.,
individual pieces that make up a city or village) objects under an empty parent
object. This way, it can be collapsed in the scene view and easily moved
together when building your game.</p><figure><p><span>

avatar, and various UI elements rendered around the player.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Game Object nesting can also have <em>functional significance</em>. For example, a
“Car” can be an object, with code that controls the car’s speed and rotation as
a whole. But individual child objects might represent the four wheels (these
would spin independently), the car body, windows, etc. Moving the parent car
object would move all the child objects, keeping their relative orientation to
the parent (and each other). We might want the player to interact with a door
separately from the rest of the car, for instance.</p><h2 id="component">Components (&amp; MonoBehaviors)</h2><figure><p><span>

    </span></p><figcaption><p>The Warrior object from the previous screenshot is shown above in Unity’s
“Inspector” window. Each illustrated section (e.g., Animator, Rigidbody,
Collider) are <em>Components</em> making up this object.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Every Game Object is comprised of <strong>Components</strong>.</p><p>A Component implements a well-defined set of behaviors for a GameObject to
execute. Everything that makes an object what it is would come from the
components that make it up:</p><ul><li>A single “visible” piece of a car will have a <em>Renderer</em> component that
paints it, and likely a <em>Collider</em> component that sets up its collision
bounds.</li><li>If a car represents the player, the car object itself might have a <em>Player
Input Controller</em> that takes key input events and translates these to code
moving the car around.</li></ul><p>While you can write large and complex Components that correspond 1:1 to an
object (e.g., a player component codes the entire player, while an enemy
component codes the enemy as a whole), it’s typically common to factor out your
logic into streamlined pieces corresponding to individual <em>traits</em>. For example:</p><ul><li>All objects with <em>health</em>, whether a Player or an Enemy, might have a
<code>LivingObject</code> component that sets an initial health value, takes damage,
and triggers a death event once it dies.</li><li>A player might additionally have an input component controlling its
movement, while the enemy might have an AI component that controls its
movement instead.</li></ul><p>Components receive various callbacks throughout their lifetime, known in Unity
as <em>Messages</em>. Examples of Messages include <code>OnEnable</code>/<code>OnDisable</code>, <code>Start</code>,
<code>OnDestroy</code>, <code>Update</code>, and others. If an object implements an <code>Update()</code> method,
this method will automagically be called by Unity in every frame of the game
loop while the object is active, and the given component is enabled. These
methods can be marked <code>private</code>; the Unity engine will still call them.</p><p>Components can also expose public methods as you’d expect. Other components can
take a reference to a component and call these public methods.</p><h2 id="asset">Assets</h2><p><strong>Assets</strong> are the on-disk resources that make up your game project. These
include meshes (models), textures, sprites, sounds, and other resources.</p><p>When serialized to the disk, your scenes are represented as assets made up of
the Game Objects inside of them. We’ll also discuss in the next section how you
can make Game Objects that are reused often into an asset known as a

<em>instances</em> in a scene. But what if a particular class of objects is commonly
repeated? Such objects can be made into a <strong>Prefab</strong>, which is effectively the
object in asset form.</p><p>Instances of a prefab in a scene can have local modifications that distinguish
it (e.g., if a <em>tree</em> object is a prefab, you can have tree instances of
different heights). Instances of a prefab all inherit and override data from
their prefab.</p><h3>Nested Prefabs</h3><p>Starting with Unity 2018.3, Prefabs can be nested just as you expect:</p><ol><li>A parent object with prefab child objects can be a prefab itself. In the
parent prefab, the child prefab instance can have its own modifications. In
the scene, the entire prefab hierarchy is instantiated, and scene-specific
modifications can layer on top.</li><li>A prefab instance in a scene with its own local modifications can be saved as
its own “Prefab Variant” asset. A variant is a prefab asset that inherits
from another prefab, applying additional modifications on top.</li></ol><p>These concepts compose; a prefab variant of a nested prefab, or a prefab variant
of a prefab variant, for instance.</p><h2 id="serialization">Serialization &amp; Deserialization</h2><p>Your project’s assets, scenes, and objects are all persisted on-disk. When
editing your game, these objects are loaded in memory and saved back to disk
using
<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/24/serialization-in-unity/">Unity’s serialization system</a>.
When playtesting your game, the objects and scenes in-memory are loaded through
the same serialization system. This system also maps between assets in your
compiled bundle and the loaded/unloaded scene objects in-memory.</p><p>The Unity Engine’s Serialization/Deserialization flow loads on-disk assets into
memory (in your project: for editing/playtesting; in-game, when loading a scene)
and is responsible for saving the state of your edited objects &amp; components back
into their scenes and prefabs.</p><p>Therefore, the serialization system is also at the core of the Unity Editor
experience itself. For a <code>MonoBehavior</code> to take an input on construction when
instantiated in a scene, those fields must be <em>serialized</em>.</p><p>Most core Unity types such as <code>GameObject</code>s, <code>MonoBehavior</code>s, and asset
resources are
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.serializableattribute">Serializable</a>
and can receive initial values on creation from within the Unity Editor. Public
fields on your <code>MonoBehavior</code> are serialized by default (if they’re of a
serializable type), and private fields need to be marked with Unity’s
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html"><code>[SerializeField]</code></a>
attribute to be serialized as well.</p><figure><p><span>
