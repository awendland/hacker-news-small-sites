<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Recently I have become curious about <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">the Gemini
Project</a> and the content that people have
made available to be retrieved over the gemini:// protocol.  I’m not convinced
by the arguments for not just using http, and mostly it’s just that I
typically find more things that I am interested in casually reading through on
people’s gemlogs than I would on, say, reddit, and similar aggregators.  But
presumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that
it’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace
conducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m
remaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate
protocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t
work and I had to spend time writing
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/gmi2email">gmi2email</a>.</p>

<p>I now have a games console at home for the first time in some years, which I
bought in response to the ongoing pandemic, and one thing that I have noticed
is that using it feels like being offline in a way that playing games on a
regular computer never would.  It has a WiFi connection but it doesn’t have a
web browser, and I am glad that using it provides an opportunity to be
disconnected from the usual streams of information.  And perhaps something
similar ought to be said in favour of how the Gemini project does not just use
http.  There is, perhaps, a positive psychological effect induced by making
the boundary between text/gemini and the web as hard as it is made by using
gemini:// rather than http.</p>

<p>Something about which I find myself much more sceptical is how the
specification for gemini:// and text/gemini is not extensible.  Advocates of
Gemini have this idea that they can’t include, say, a version number in the
protocol, because the extensibility of the web is what has led to the problems
they think it has, so they want to make it impossible.  Now on the one hand
perhaps the people behind Gemini are in the best position that anyone is in to
come up with a spec which they will finalise and render effectively
unchangeable, because a lot of them have been using Gopher for decades, and so
they have enough experience to be able to say exactly what Gopher is missing,
and be confident that they’ve not missed anything.  But on the other hand,
Gemini is one technological piece in attempts to make a version of the
Internet which is healthier for humans – the so-called “small Internet”
movement – and maybe there will be new ideas about how the small Internet
should be which would benefit from a new version of the Gemini specification.
So it seems risky to lock-in to one version.</p>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In a previous <a href="https://onurgumus.github.io/2020/12/26/Functional-Programming.html">post</a> I have explained my motivations for functional programming.
It’s no secret I love F# because F# makes me sleep better. In this post, I would like to discuss some different aspects of F#.</p>

<h2 id="f-is-gaining-independence-from-net">F# is gaining independence from .NET</h2>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/platform.png" alt="F# platforms"></p>

<!--more-->

<p>F# is mostly known to the developer community as the small ignored brother of C# running on the .NET platform. However, what is less known about F# is that it
has come to a level to be .NET independent. Thanks to <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, today F# can be considered as a complete replacement of TypeScript. Yes,
people do write full-blown SPA, React, Svelte applications by using F# instead of TypeScript. If you think Fable is just a transpiler, think again:  https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable . I would say Fable is on the way being an ecosystem by itself.</p>

<p>There is also a new prototype target for Fable that allows F# code to transpile to Python developed by Dag Brattli.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/python2.gif" alt="Python"></p>

<p>F# also works as on WebAssembly with <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a> which is still based on .NET. And not to forget another F# web platform called <a href="https://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a> from the same people who developed Bolero.</p>

<p>Just like JavaScript people were using NodeJs to bring the front-end devs to the backend zone, F# also can be used to bring the backend-devs to the front-end realm. I am a living example myself. By using F# in the font-end you can practically share the code between your .NET/Node backend and the browser, giving you an isomorphic development experience.</p>

<p>This somewhat puts F# in an interesting position as historically most dotnet has been languages are managed by Microsoft. But Fable simply liberates
F# from Microsoft and .NET.</p>

<h2 id="the-f-fanboys">The F# fanboys</h2>

<p>You might have heard “one of those guys” like me who is talking about how great functional programming and/or F# is. And from that point, it looks like below</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/music.png" alt="music"></p>

<p>I know it’s annoying, however, let’s look at it from the side and this is how an F# developer feels when he or she is suggesting you using F#:
<img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/wheel.png" alt="wheels"></p>

<h2 id="microsofts-and-communitys-stance">Microsoft’s and community’s stance</h2>

<p>From Microsoft’s point of view, F# is actively supported and maintained. There are Microsoft developers actively fixing things and adding new features however as a general Microsoft’s point of view .NET == C# and that is that. From .NET developer community’s
point of view, things are even worse. Since all Microsoft docs and tools geared towards C#, adding up unfamiliarity with the functional paradigm, most people follow C# way and completely ignore its little brother F#. I still think this is a missed 
opportunity for the .NET community. For example, let’s look at the excellent server side F# web framework <a href="https://giraffe.wiki/">Giraffe</a>. 
While C# and asp.net developers are busy memorizing the Microsoft way of handling requests, learning what attributes to decorate their
classes and members, the F# developers who use giraffe, simply rely on functional composition:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>route</span> <span>"/"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setHttpHeader</span> <span>"X-Foo"</span> <span>"Bar"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setStatusCode</span> <span>200</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setBodyFromString</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As HTTP processing is usually treated as a pipeline by itself on the server-side, it’s an excellent target for functional programming. Just like lego, plug-in your pipes, and you are good to go.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most developers worry about if they could find an F# job whereas companies who consider making the switch worry if they could find an F# developer.
As of today on linked in there are approximately 700 F# jobs and even most of these are not F# specific rather than they are like “C# or F# developers wanted”.</p>

<p>And most non-.NET people are not willing to touch anything related to Microsoft even with a 10 foot pole. (Of course, the major exceptions to this are TypeScript and Visual Studio Code which both are widely popular). The  Functional programmers’ camp also dismisses F# at sight blaming it’s not like Haskell as in for example F# does not support type classes.</p>

<h2 id="couple-of-unique-features-of-f">Couple of unique features of F#</h2>

<p>I am not going to talk about the features of F# but just wanted to highlight a couple of them.</p>

<p>The first one is the file order. Please look at the below photo:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/files.png" alt="file-order"></p>

<p>In F# the order of the files matter. It is somewhat a disliked feature by the newcomers, but it makes the dependencies immediately visible.
So the code in the top file has no dependency on any others below and the 2nd file from the top only depends on the first. When you open a project which you are not 
familiar, file ordering helps to find your way.</p>

<p>The second one is Type Providers:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/sqlprovider.gif" alt="type-providers"></p>

<p>Type providers are somewhat code generators but they do that non-intrusively. Very roughly similar to LISP style macros they expand at compile time. Type providers make it very easy to discover HTML or JSON documents read database rows, file system, and discover DDL and rows within the coding screen without leaving your editor. And everything becomes so type-safe.</p>

<h2 id="develop-fantastic-ui-apps-with-f-and-elmish">Develop fantastic UI apps with F# and Elmish</h2>

<p>Well they say seeing is believing, so let’s see how well F# handles UI development. While React devs on Facebook trying to solve the state problem over and over again by using hooks and perhaps new experimental
recoil and contexts IMHO, all are horrible options as they encourage rendering code inter-mix with business code reminding me asp.net web forms times where you could write your SQL statements right into the page itself.</p>

<p>F# developers have ported elm architecture to something called elmish and it flourished well among F# community.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of things you can do with Elmish as you can write your business code once and port it to any UI platform below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/react">Elmish React</a></li>
  <li>Windows Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">Elmish WPF</a></li>
  <li>Gaming: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Xelmish">Xelmish</a></li>
  <li>Cross platform UI: <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Avalonia.FuncUI">Avalonia.FuncUI</a></li>
  <li>Mobile development: <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous">Fabulous</a></li>
  <li>Terminal: <a href="https://github.com/DieselMeister/Terminal.Gui.Elmish">Terminal.Gui.Elmish</a></li>
  <li>Web Assembly: <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They all share the same single architecture: Elmish. So you can write your code for one and port it to another.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-some-resources">Getting started and some resources</h2>

<p>If you want to get started to F#, the first place you should check out is <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F# Software Foundation</a></p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/fsf2.png" alt="fsharp-foundation"></p>

<p>As you can see FSharp Software Foundation offers mentorship programs periodically, which means you can have a free weekly 1 on 1 session with an experienced F# developer! As of today the program is open for people who want to have an F# mentor or want to be
an F# mentor. You can apply from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKgZaAcjf7ZxVqBZzyZcBi609BOc0etBnV5XhR6BMihdyYRw/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sold with F# there is one important point to highlight. Do not treat F#, just another language with different syntax especially if you are familiar
with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, etc. You have to embrace functional programming as a paradigm. F# is a functional-first programming language. In other words,
although F# has OOP syntax as well, it mostly makes sense to use F# when you want to get benefit from functional programming concepts. If you try to program
F# the same way you program other imperative languages you won’t get much benefit.</p>

<p>If you are a C# develeoper and you want to start functional programming with F# this is the go-to book:
<em>Disclaimer: I do not know the author nor I am affiliated with the publisher by any way</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp">Functional programming in C#</a></p>

<p>Although the book is mostly about C#, it will show you how painful to do functional programming with C# and only perhaps then you can develop
some love for F#. Having that said it will also help you to understand some more new coming but confusing features of C# 9 like Records and Pattern matching.
If you think  C# records are for immutability, no they are not. They are for Value semantics and <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/#:~:text=In%20functional%20programming%2C%20referential%20transparency,the%20result%20of%20the%20program.">referential transparency</a>.</p>

<p>To try F# right away you may use the following links:</p>

<p>https://try.fsharp.org/</p>

<p>https://fable.io/repl/</p>

<p>https://tryfsharp.fsbolero.io/</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>When you are unfamiliar with F# syntax, it might look a bit cryptic. And I have seen some people complained that it is very verbose. On the contrary, I would make a bold claim that F# beats most other languages when it comes to conciseness. You don’t believe me? see it your self (make sure you check all implementations)</p>

<p><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:F_Sharp">F# problems on Rosetta Code</a></p>

<h2 id="a-couple-of-toy-projects-of-mine">A couple of toy projects of mine</h2>

<p>I have developed commercial applications with F#, but as public stuff here are a couple of projects I have built. One is a full blazor/web assembly project:</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/FBlazorShop</p>

<p>And the actual app for the 3D bin packing problem, in which items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/BinDrake</p>

<p>Trying and learning F# really requires you to dismiss your prejudices and be patient. But in the end, once you master the functional paradigm,
it makes you sleep better as a developer.</p>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>WhatsApp wasn’t the first instant messenger of its kind, and probably won’t be the last. I simply chose to focus on WhatsApp since its recent privacy issues have made it a hot topic.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform many regions. I’m stunned at its ubiquity every time I visit my extended family in India; I’m frequently greeted by looks of confusion when I remind them that I don’t use WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially …</p></section></article></div></div>

        <h2 id="github-should-start-an-app-store">GitHub Should Start An App Store</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Google suspended Elements - matrix chat app - from play store <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25965443">without any reasonable explanation</a>. I think this was an automated removal triggered by user reports or some other factors. The matrix team tried to reach out to them for explanation to no avail. We have seen this pattern in many cases now. Either it’s getting overwhelming for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps like Elements which is decentralized to be on their store. The later mostly seems like a conspiracy theory and I think former is more true. In any case, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern what gets installed and not on billions of devices. A decentralized app store whould be best to fight this sort of suspensions but it’s far from reality at the moment. The alternative? GitHub App Store.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-github">But Why GitHub?</h3>
<p>Few reasons why I think GitHub is our best bet:</p>
<ol>
<li>They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.</li>
<li>Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">youtube-dl</a> debacle.</li>
<li>Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.</li>
<li>They could finally give the desktop the app store it deserves</li>
<li>This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.</li>
</ol>
<p>They will have to create app store applications for major platforms along with provision to host closed source applications on their store and they should be good to go. Honestly I can not imagine any other player being more successful in app stores than GitHub.</p>
<p><em>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355663753380032512">Google has reinstated Elements</a></em></p>

        <p>There's been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood's actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that's mainly because it's a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers. </p>
<h2>First, what happened</h2>
<p>On that fateful day, Gamestop stock had massive volatility, and given the cries of "Buy!" and "Hold!" from /r/WSBs, I'd assume on Robinhood, a broker targeted at retail investors, it'd be heavily imbalanced towards buy trades.</p>
<p>As volatility increased, the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) increased the deposit requirements for brokers. Basically, when you submit a trade on a broker, the exchange of money for stock doesn't actually happen until 2 days later, and the firm that handles that exchange is called a clearing firm. Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that's all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.</p>
<p>That's a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn't have the money on settlement? The clearing firm would be on the hook. So the DTCC requires that brokers put up a deposit beforehand. On that day, the DTCC massively increased the deposit requirements for brokers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but said that by the end of the day industrywide collateral requirements jumped to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">Levine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week">Robinhood</a></p>
<p>So, Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. And they quickly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/robinhood-gamestop-reddit/index.html">scrounged up some capital</a> so they could continue on Friday.</p>
<h3>Robinhood's Clearing Firm</h3>
<p>Robinhood actually has their own clearing firm, Robinhood Securities... for some reason, but it's still a DTCC member and must listen to what the SEC regulates. </p>
<h3>update 12:32 - On margin?</h3>
<p>Some people seem to be mistaking the situation. It is not about margin accounts - while yes, Robinhood "instant transfers" provides the illusion of being instant effectively with margin, it's not really the issue here.</p>
<p>Brokers cannot use client money to satisfy their clearing fund obligation.  So whether or not the accounts had a settled balance didn't matter - as you can see from the other brokers which halted buys and did not have "instant transfers".</p>
<p>Again, this is about what's effectively <em>collateral</em> the brokers must put up so that all parties can mitigate the risk of a broker failing. Of course client money is used when the transaction <em>settles</em>, but, naturally, you can't use their money, which isn't yours, as collateral.</p>
<h2>But why ONLY Buys?</h2>
<p>The deposit requirement is </p>
<p><code>deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market</code></p>
<p>And the variable to look at is the 99% 2d VaR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volatility component is designed to capture the market price risk associated with each Member’s portfolio at a 99th percentile level of confidence. The VaR Charge is the volatility component applicable to most Net Unsettled Positions, and usually comprises the largest portion of a Member’s Required Deposit. Procedure XV of the Rules currently provides that the VaR Charge shall be calculated in accordance with a generally accepted portfolio volatility margin model utilizing assumptions based on reasonable historical data and an appropriate volatility range. As such, NSCC currently calculates a Member’s VaR Charge utilizing the VaR model, which incorporates an EWMA volatility
estimation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf">SEC</a></p>
<p>Remember when I subtracted John's buys of $600 with Mary's sell of $290 to get $310? That's the broker's net unsettled cash positions. The 99% VaR is basically, "99% of the time the broker's net unsettled will not be higher than X". You might remember if you took statistics about confidence intervals; this is the upper 99% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>Bad Desmos Graphs</h3>
<p>So, let's model our risk as a Normal curve, for simplicity's sake. Here I've graphed a normal distribution with a line representing the 95% percentile</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Y axis is probability, the X axis is Robinhood's net unsettled positions. The more positive, the more money they'd owe theoretically.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if more people buy than sell? Then it'd shift over to the right</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r2" alt=""></p>
<p>Hasn't the 95% percentile moved rightward as well? Now, what happens if the market is super volatile (i.e, the std dev of the distribution increases)</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r3" alt=""></p>
<p>Wow, now it's even more to the right! </p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>buys make this worse</strong>, <strong>sells make it better</strong>. Robinhood <em>could not</em> execute buys, because it would increase the deposits they'd need, which they legally must obligate by.  Sells, on the other hand, do not have this problem. They would not push the 95% boundary more to the right.</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>So really, it's not a bad decision or good decision that Robinhood halted buys of GME - it wasn't a decision, and it wasn't something they alone did.</p>
<p>These brokers halted buys of GME</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood</li>
<li>Webull</li>
<li>M1 Finance</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>E-Trade</li>
</ul>
<p>While others only halted options</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive</li>
<li>TDA</li>
<li>Schwab</li>
<li>Tradeing212</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm, see a pattern? The former group includes companies like Robinhood (2013), WeBull (2017), M1 Finance (2015), while the latter has TDA (1975), Schwab(1971), Trading212 (2004).</p>
<p>(Okay, E-Trade is actually old too, but I guess they're just cash-strapped right now?)</p>
<p>Looks like young brokers with a limited capital resources to me.</p>
<h2>Stay or Switch?</h2>
<p>If there's something to fault Robinhood, it's that they're a young, janky broker (and also you might be getting screwed on the spread by Citadel). If they had more money on-hand they might not have had to stop buys of Gamestop. Perhaps they should have expected this and raised more capital earlier. </p>
<p>And that's a real reason to stay away from Robinhood. But for the love of god do not swap to WeBull or something if that's your concern.</p>
<p>And don't do it because you're abhorred by Robinhood's class warfare or something. Because that didn't happen - it was a mixture of SEC regulations and a cash-strapped startup (well, cash-strapped on big broker scales).</p>
<p>Although if you want to get mad at Hedge Funds anyway, feel free! You should always be mad at Hedge Funds. But please pick a real reason - you have no lack of choice to pick from.</p>

          <section><p>Online retailers know a lot about how their customers are navigating their virtual stores. Offline retailers are not so&nbsp;lucky.</p>
<p>Together with consumer behavior experts <a href="https://b-clarity.com/case/100-000-human-interactions-cant-be-wrong-touch-increases-sales/" target="_blank">B:Clarity</a> and a multinational home appliance brand we built a system to help understand customer movement and&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>The system consists of wireless sensors that are installed in electronics stores. A few hundred sensors in each&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>There are two types of&nbsp;sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vibration sensors. That trigger when someone is trying out a&nbsp;product.</li>
<li>Light sensors. Trigger when someone is standing in front of a&nbsp;product.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these sensors, we can see what items are most popular, how it correlates to sales data – and how to take action to improve&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>But without collecting any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">personally identifiable information</a>.</p>
<p>This is what the sensors look&nbsp;like:</p>

<h2 id="why-monitor-shoppers-">Why monitor&nbsp;shoppers?</h2>
<p>Online retailers and e-commerce has many ways to gain insight into their customers. Examples include seeing the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items</a>, and the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches-with-no-results" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items with no results</a>.</p>
<p>Physical retailers don’t want to be left&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>So many different ways to monitor shoppers in physical stores have been&nbsp;developed.</p>
<p>Amazon Go stores extensively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/" target="_blank">use cameras</a> to track everything that happens inside their&nbsp;stores.</p>
<p>Many stores provide free WiFi so that they can <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/" target="_blank">track their customers</a>.</p>
<p>All these solutions have a big problem:&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Cameras see everything – much more than they need. And this data is collected and stored. Free WiFi hotspots may capture all kinds of&nbsp;traffic.</p>
<p>This is an obvious privacy problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>But it is not just a problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>It also creates a major problem for the companies storing the data: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/silicon-valley-terrified-california-privacy-law/" target="_blank">personally identifiable data is a liability</a>.</p>
<p>This is why we chose vibration sensors and light sensors. No liability from owning any personally identifiable&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>With only vibration and light, there simply is nothing there to identify individual&nbsp;shoppers.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-shopper-behavior">Understanding shopper&nbsp;behavior</h2>
<p>As a shopper, you want to find the best products, and – ideally – pay the lowest possible&nbsp;price.</p>
<p>The retailers and producers have slightly different&nbsp;motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands want customer to buy their products, and not their&nbsp;competitors’</li>
<li>Retailers want to sell more&nbsp;products</li>
</ul>
<p>And when the motivations of shoppers, retailers, and brands align, business is made. And the more business, the better for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Understanding customer behavior is key to improving the experience for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>The sensors detect when people are looking at items. And they report this immediately, so that we can see in real-time where shoppers&nbsp;are.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-wireless-iot-mesh-network-">Why use a wireless IoT mesh&nbsp;network?</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh network is a wireless network that automatically extend its&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh network solution uses so-called <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/what-is-subghz-networking/" target="_blank">sub-GHz wireless technology</a> that has way better range than traditional WiFi or&nbsp;Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But even with a longer range, it is not always&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Electronics stores can be very large. And there is plenty of metal inside them that hampers the wireless&nbsp;coverage.</p>
<p>A mesh network is the ideal technology in these&nbsp;situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Coverage</strong>. Electronics stores can be huge. With a mesh network, we can cover it&nbsp;all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It just works</strong>. No network planning is&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to install</strong>. Just put each device where it should&nbsp;be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to maintain</strong>. If there are issues with coverage, just add extenders as&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>. If something changes, the network will automatically adapt and&nbsp;overcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the wireless mesh network typically looks&nbsp;like:</p>

<p>In this deployment, the mesh network used one access point and two extenders. Most device are able to reach the access point directly, but some chose to talk to one of the&nbsp;extenders.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery&nbsp;life</h2>
<p>The sensors are equipped with batteries: one coin-cell battery&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh system is <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">tailored for extreme low-power operation</a>. Extreme low-power operation in this case means that the sensors can go for several months one a single&nbsp;charge.</p>
<p>For example, the sensors are automatically turned off at night, to conserve their precious&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the Thingsquare system continuously collects power consumption data from each and every&nbsp;sensor.</p>
<p>This data lets us see the exact behavior at any given time: are there any sensors that behave in a way that require their batteries to be replaced earlier? The Thingsquare system knows the answers to this, and alerts us if this would be the&nbsp;case.</p>

<p>The ioT mesh network is connected to the Internet via a 4G modem. The network maintains a stable encrypted connection to the backend system so that the devices always can be&nbsp;reached.</p>

<p>First occurrence on <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter" title="Eth0:2010 Winter">eth0:2010 Winterlan</a>, the LackRack is the ultimate, low-cost, high shininess solution for your modular datacenter-in-the-living-room. Featuring the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270">LACK</a> (side table) from Ikea, the LackRack is an easy-to-implement, exact-fit datacenter building block.
It's a little known fact that we have seen Google engineers tinker with Lack tables since way back in 2009.
</p><p>The LackRack will certainly make its appearance again this summer at <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Summer" title="Eth0:2010 Summer">eth0:2010 Summer</a>.
</p>

Its low-cost and perfect fit are great for mounting up to 8 U of 19" hardware, such as switches (see below), or perhaps other 19" gear. It's very easy to assemble, and thanks to the design, they are stable enough to hold (for example) 19" switches and you can put your bottle of Club-Mate on top! Multi-shiny LackRack can also be painted to your specific preferences and the airflow is unprecedented!
</p>
<p>You can find a howto on buying a LackRack on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mrngm.com/eth0/LackRack/">this page</a>. This includes the proof that a 19" switch can indeed be placed in the LackRack in its natural habitat!
</p>
<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack-w-switch.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/d/d7/Lackrack-w-switch.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="188" data-file-width="2592" data-file-height="1944"></a></p><div><p>Close-up of the LackRack, with a switch, in its natural habitat (the IKEA)</p></div></div></div>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:5x_lackrack.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/9/99/5x_lackrack.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" data-file-width="800" data-file-height="800"></a></p><div><p>Illustration of the LackRack's modularity</p></div></div></div><p><i>For assembly in terms of a programming language, this is not the page you need.</i>
</p><p>However, in order to assemble the LackRack, there are a few prerequisites or tools that are needed:
</p>
<ul><li>1 (or more) LACK side table from Ikea</li>
<li>Screwdriver (whether muscle-driven or motor-driven, with preference of the latter)</li>
<li>Wood screws (they should fit in the rack mounts on your appliance, and not exceed 1" in length)</li>
<li>Spare time</li></ul>
<p>That's all! First, follow the assembly instructions in the Ikea manual in order to assemble the LACK.
After that, the installation of your 19" hardware can begin. When assembling a larger number of LACKs, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA_Hack_a_Lack/">this link</a> describes a useful tool for fitting the legs to the tabletop.
</p><p>The LackRack is a stackable modular product. Additional elements can be stacked on top easily. Brackets to secure the top element to the bottom one are not included but available from your local non-computer hardware store.
</p>
<ul><li>If you put several LackRacks side by side, the higher levels can be staggered to form a pyramid. This feature is not present in any other of the commercially available rack products.</li></ul>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack2.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/7/76/Lackrack2.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="400" data-file-width="1536" data-file-height="2048"></a></p><div><p>Due to their light weight design, Lackracks will grow to any required size without compromise</p></div></div></div>
<p>Installing hardware in your LackRack is easy!
</p>
<ul><li><i>Optional but recommended</i> - Put the table on its side (which one is your decision) or upside down</li>
<li>Mount the hardware between the left and right leg
<ul><li>If you mount the first item, it is recommended to install it against the table top for good fit. This happens automatically if you have the LackRack upside down, except in zero gravity environments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Screw all the screws that fit in the rack mount in the left and right leg (for stability).
<ul><li>With deep units, a Z-shaped bracket may be advisable to secure the rear of the unit against the underside of the tabletop.</li></ul></li>
<li>&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Profit! (note how <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rackable.com/">lackable.com</a> has been bought by sgi recently)</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Note">Note</span></h2>
<p>Current LACK tables have hollow legs; only the top 5 cm (2") is solid. Fitting equipment below the solid section may require the use of cavity plugs, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fischer-international.com/en/products/cavity-fixings/board-fixing/metal-cavity-fixing-hm/519772-hm-5-x-37-s">these</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Goodies">Goodies</span></h2>
<ul><li>You can put food and/or drink on your rack.</li>
<li>You can put a small lamp on top of the rack to see your hardware and/or better find the aforementioned food and drink.</li>
<li>The table can be painted in a color of your preference, or decorated in various ways. The eth0 Design team can advise, for a fee, how to optimally decorate the rack to suit your environment.
<ul><li>That means, no more dull black/gray racks!</li>
<li>Or you can put <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lack2.jpg" title="File:Lack2.jpg">stickers of your favorite event</a> on them.</li></ul></li>
<li>It's easy to colour-code your datacentre: e.g. <span>red</span> for critical services, <span>grey</span> for office automation, <span>green</span> for file-servers, <span>black</span> for systems and network management.</li>
<li>Cheap!</li>
<li>Easy!</li>

<ul><li>Q: Does the LackRack provide redundant power supply?
<ul><li>A: Only if you add it yourself</li></ul></li>
<li>Q: Can I put my (coffee) mug on top and don't have to worry about it if I spill liquid on the LackRack?
<ul><li>A: You can spill coffee on the LackRack, since it can be cleaned quite easily. However, if you have appliances <b>in</b> the LackRack, there is a chance that these appliances cannot handle the coffee (or any other liquid). You should take precautions in order to protect your appliances</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/catalog/products/00095036">Ikea LACK coffee table</a>: almost twice as deep, and comes with a shelf. Its size allows both short ends to be used as rack space simultaneously. It's interesting to note that Ikea photographed it from the side; an uncommon artistic approach to 19" server rack photography.
It provides for 8 U of hardware: 4 on either side of the shelf.
</p><p>Following ICT tradition, the Enterprise Edition is more than three times as expensive, while providing less stability than two of the regular products combined.

<p>It is clear that Ikea has strived to keep many of their products
rack compatible since so many of them are capable of housing 19"
equipment. See <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/List_of_IkeaRacks" title="List of IkeaRacks">List_of_IkeaRacks</a>

In case you aren’t familiar with the term “data warehouse”, it’s basically a database that centralizes your data to be used for analysis. There are many databases you can choose from, for example in Simon Willison’s talk, he uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. I chose <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> because I’m familiar with it and so far I have liked what Ive seen. Some features that make it stand out for me are things like <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html">time travel</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop-table.html">undrop table</a>, a rich set of <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-operators-functions.html">functions</a>, among many others.</p><p>Ok great, so we now have an empty database to start with. But a database is only useful when there is data in it to query. So we must choose which datasets to pull into our freshly minted database. I’m going to start with bringing in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> data because I’m a big fan of the site and it has an actual <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> which means we wont have to be scraping HTML. I’m also going to bring in stock data into the warehouse to see if we can get any stock information out of Hacker News. Finally we’ll analyze the stock market and correlate stocks to the latest GameStop stock craze.</p><p>The first part of the plan will be to get the Hacker News data loaded into Snowflake. Then I’ll use Snowflake’s Data Marketplace to bring in the stock data, which will save me from writing an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform).</p><h2>Getting an initial dump of the Hacker News data.</h2><p>I wanted to write as little code as possible to get this initial historical dump of Hacker News so I decided to use a combination of curl, bash and parallel to get the job done. I first used <a href="https://ec2instances.info/">ec2instances.info</a> to find a relatively cheap CPU per dollar machine. I spun up a c5a.8xlarge on AWS which has 32 vCPUs.<br>I wouldn’t be surprised if there were cheaper options, but I just eyeballed it.</p><p>Let’s get the largest item ID:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611791428293_3993"><div><pre><code>curl https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json</code></pre></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611792427454_4138"><div><p>Which returned: 25,806,058</p><p>Sigh, looks like we’re going to have to do 25 million HTTP calls.

To quote Dyatlov from Chernobyl, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg5HOnq7zD0">“Not great, not terrible”</a>.</p><p>I ended up writing a python <a href="https://github.com/thomasdziedzic/hackernews-fill-gaps/blob/master/main.py">script</a> to calculate and download these missing items. If you know how one would generate the missing ids between the gaps (which could be of variable size), I would sure like to learn how you accomplish that because it might have spared me from writing this python script. Moving on…</p><p>I also found that the API returns some nulls for items.

We must do better, for the sake of my wallet.</p><p>I gave up trying to figure out how to do it purely from a shell scripting perspective, and wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/thomasdziedzic/hackernews-etl/blob/master/main.py">Python script</a> to figure out which items it needs to extract, and then load into Snowflake. This script can be run without user intervention and will keep the data up-to-date. Using Python to write the ELT gave me more flexibility to fix some things that I saw as issues. For example, the script starts N * 4 (where N is the number of logical cpus) jobs and only produces N * 4 files instead of 1 file per item. This approach will avoid having to do an expensive file combination step at the end. I also added some awesome progress bars to the script so that I knew how many requests remain thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alphatwirl/atpbar/issues/21#issuecomment-766468695">Tai Sakuma</a>.</p><p>Running this script from my laptop (a Dell 9370 Developer Edition with 8 logical cores) and spotty Wi-Fi, script extracts items from the API at about 130 items/second. This is slower than extracting from a c5a.8xlarge machine, but at least my laptop isn’t charging me $1.232/hour for using it. And my script has the benefit of not having to combine millions of tiny files at the end. Let’s test my incremental loading script out on an ec2 instance to see how it really compares with my naive approach.</p><h2>Downloading incremental data from Hacker News using my script</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611883239126_31321"><div><pre><code>$ time { poetry run python main.py ; }

<p><em>Update: large parts of this story may, in fact, be fiction. See the addendum at the end for details.</em></p>
<p>Film rights are a strange and complex thing, especially when it comes to existing properties. The contracts for these things can involve a labyrinthine series of clauses and negotiations, where the owners of the original property want to include cut-off clauses that will enable them to claw back the rights and sell them again, possibly for much more money if the adaptation has been a success, the artistic creator wants to hold on to some level of creative control and the film studio wants to ensure that neither of those things happens. We’ve seen assorted shenanigans at work across the board – the <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2018/08/30/big-bond-themes-and-secret-agent-cover-versions/">James Bond</a> copyright snafu that saw the film rights for <strong>Casino Royale</strong> owned and exploited by another company than the one that made the official series, and perhaps most famously in terms of contractual obligations, the first <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> movie, made as a low-budget throwaway affair simply to ensure that the film rights stayed with Constantin Film, who was not quite ready to make a ‘proper’ version of the story but who saw the potential in the property and didn’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most absurd of these contractual obligation projects came with <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, which was adapted into a TV series that ran for four seasons – which would suggest a major hit show by 1970s television standards, except for the fact that it never aired. Not a single episode beyond the pilot was shown on TV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> was a major hit in 1974 and remains one of the most beloved Hollywood comedies – well, perhaps not with Millenials and Generation Z, given the film’s rather liberal use of the sort of racist language that is now strictly forbidden, even in context. Mel Brooks’ comedy western mocked American racism brutally – perhaps a little too brutally in the use of one particular word, which is bandied about throughout the film. It was a different time.</p>

<p>Brooks was on fire as a filmmaker in 1974, and there was every reason to expect <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> to be a massive hit, as indeed it was. Having dealt with studios enough by this point, Brooks knew that they might want to take the project away from him and produce sequels – the story essentially opened itself up for on-going narratives. And so he came up with a cunning plan. The contracts for the film stated that there could only be film sequels if a TV series follow-up was made within six months. Brooks and his legal team were pretty certain that the film was too profane and vulgar to ever be adapted as a TV series. I mean, what could they do? Strip it back to its most basic elements while throwing out everything that made the film what it was?</p>
<p>Well, that was precisely what happened. In 1977, Warner Brothers announced plans for a sequel film – in fact, a series of sequels – to <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and when Brooks and his lawyers waved the contract at them, they pulled their ace card – a four-season series based on the original film that had gone into production very quickly in 1974. As Brooks explained, <em>“Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another Blazing Saddles, and I say, ‘No. You don’t have the right to do that.’ They say, ‘Yes we do, we’ve been making a TV series and still control the rights.’ What TV series? I haven’t seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it.”</em></p>
<p>You have to almost admire Warner Brothers’ gall here, and – oddly – their belief in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>. Not only did they rush a series into production in 1974, but they kept it in production – because the contract only allowed a new movie within six months of the last <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> project – for four years until they finally had a movie ready. TV shows might be cheaper than films, but nevertheless, imagine how much they had to spend, making four seasons of a show just to hold onto the film rights.</p>
<p>In fact, the pilot episode of <strong>Black Bart</strong>, as the series is called, was shown once in 1975 on CBS, with no one even noticing. Well, why would they? As well as changing the title (because the contract also failed to state that any TV series be <em>called</em> <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>), Brooks wasn’t credited, with Andrew Bergman, who originally came up with the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> idea listed as creator. The show starred Louis Gossett Jr as Sheriff Bart, continuing his battles against both criminals and racists, while the other film characters were replaced with similar, but not identical characters to avoid crediting Brooks. Both the cast – including Gerrit Graham – and the characters are lightweight versions of the originals, the humour is almost non-existent and the laugh track just hammers home how unfunny the show is. And yet it is a professional work, and arguably no less forced than several other sitcoms of the era. So the question is: why didn’t they just put in a bit more effort and then show the damn thing instead of paying everyone to shoot twenty-four episodes that would sit, unseen, in the Warner Brothers vaults?</p>

<p>Presumably, the answer is that a TV show – even a good TV show – would have diluted the appeal of another film. The 1970s were a different time (we mentioned that, right?) and there was less crossover of film and TV – sure, some films – like <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2020/09/27/go-ape-the-planet-of-the-apes-book-and-comics-of-the-1970s/"><strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></a> – were adapted into TV shows, but those shows were rarely successful and were seen as having essentially killed off any chance of audiences then going to the cinema to watch a movie version. If anything, <strong>Black Bart</strong> might have served as a sign of just how bad a Mel Brooks-free version of <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> could be. So instead of putting any effort into making a decent TV series based on the property (and there’s certainly the potential there), Warner Brothers simply put the least possible effort into making something that would still legally stand up as a TV show that could, in theory, be broadcast – and then buried it.</p>
<p>What the cast and crew thought of all this is hard to gauge – Gossett has talked about the weirdness of it all, but you have to wonder just how anyone managed to drum up any enthusiasm once it became clear that the show would never air. Ironically, the plans for a <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> sequel ultimately went nowhere – by 1979, it was clear that the moment had passed and audience tastes had changed. The sequel was shelved, and the series was finally cancelled. The pilot episode has since turned up on the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> DVD and blu-ray, but the other episodes have yet to be seen. It’s entirely possible that they were never even completed beyond the ones shown to Brooks, and may have been trashed. A pity, as we’ll never know if it accidentally improved.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> We feel it’s important to point out that some sources are claiming since we originally posted this that the entire story – with the exception of the<strong> Black Bart</strong> pilot, which definitely exists and is perhaps a weird enough thing in itself – is in fact a spoof that has somehow become accepted as reality – ‘fake news’, as I believe it is known. There are several sources online claiming that this story is authentic; others claiming that it is satire (links appear in the comments). Unless Mel Brooks – or perhaps Louis Gossett – wants to come clean on the actual facts, it perhaps remains a mystery. Stranger-than-fiction may, or may not, be actual fiction, and isn’t that depressing when it’s a story as good as this? As Tony Wilson said (or possibly didn’t say, there’s the rub), <em>“when&nbsp;you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend.”</em></p>

My personal preferences are <a href="https://azure.com/">Azure</a>, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/c844c6492d23">Digital Ocean</a> <em>(affiliate link)</em>, or <a href="https://scaleway.com/">Scaleway</a>. They each offer enough compute, networking options, storage, and basic services to build out proofs-of-concept or whatever you might need.</p><p>Another honorable mention here is <a href="https://hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. They offer a good level of hardware, service and price.</p><h3 id="the-virtual-machines">The Virtual Machines</h3><p>For those side projects and many enterprise applications, <strong>scale is not an issue</strong>. That means that I will not serve thousands of simultaneous users or handling terabytes of data. Therefore I can get by on the smaller offerings – usually under $20/month. Even Azure (the most expensive of the three) offer their burstable VMs. Generally I like to go with <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/virtual-instances/development/">Scaleway's Developer line of servers</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Notice that Kubernetes is missing from my stack?

Nginx is great, but it was not built for the Docker universe. Traefik has two killer features that have saved me hours upon hours:</p><ol><li>Automatic TLS with LetsEncrypt. Literally set-it-and-forget-it. With the right API keys and DNS provider you can also do verification with DNS.</li><li>Automatic no-reload configuration using docker labels. When you spin up new services Traefik will pickup the changes automatically because it listens to all Docker-related events. This makes it incredibly convenient to add, remove, or merge services as needed without any hassle.</li></ol><p>My only comment on Traefik is that there is a bit of a learning curve. You have to decide how you want to configure it (config file, command line options, yaml, or docker labels, or use a combination!)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Another note here: I have already <a href="https://www.simplecto.com/traefik-2-0-docker-and-letsencrypt/" title="Traefik 2 production ready configurations">published my production configuations for Traefik</a> here.</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="postgres-for-database">Postgres for Database</h3><p>Tried and True, PostgreSQL has never let me down.

It polls the database for relevant actions and then does it's thing. &nbsp;</p><p>Edit: 2021 - This has paid off in a big way. I have been running a website screenshot project for over a year now with this pattern. It takes about 1500 website screenshots per day. All of it is scheduled and managed by a Django command.</p><p>That project lives here: https://github.com/simplecto/screenshots</p><h3 id="intercoolerjs-because-who-needs-the-complexity">IntercoolerJS, because who needs the complexity?</h3><p>I have a lot to say about this, but that will have to go into a series of posts. The tldr; here that I use this lovely little javascript library along with jQuery (<em>yeah, it is 2020, and I still use jQuery</em>) to make parts of my applications <em>feel</em> like single-page-apps but not really.</p><p>IntercoolerJS keeps that old-school "Ajax" (remember that word) goodness and allows me to update the DOM with HTML from the backend. It is seamless, smooth, and really convenient for things like logins and small form updates.</p><p>I strongly suggest you check it out: <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Learn more about IntercoolerJS</a></p><p>Edit 2021: The creator has released <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, the successor to IntercoolerJS.</p><h3 id="sentry-to-catch-production-errors">Sentry to catch production errors</h3><p>I make mistakes. Lots of mistakes--but there is no need to show them to my users, right? Sentry gives me an easy and convenient way to capture production bugs as they happen. Some cool things about them:</p><ol><li>Open source-ish (<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry">relicensed here</a>), so you can host yourself if that is your thing.</li><li>Easy few lines added to your <code>settings.py</code> file in Django and that is it.</li><li>Tight integration to your Git repos and Issue tracking systems for full production defect traceability.</li></ol><p>Another nice thing is that you can disable it for development.</p><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Check out Sentry here</a>.</p><h3 id="bitbucket-pipelines-for-ci-cd">Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD</h3><p>Edit: 2021 - I no longer use CI/CD for deployment of my one-man projects. It is too much tooling and complexity. I simply run tests with PyCharm and ship directly to production from my development machine.</p><p>There are so many CI/CD offerings out there today, but I have been happy with Bitbucket's offering called Pipelines. They offer you a few hundred minutes free every month with the option to top-up as needed for a small fee. I have rarely had problems, and I really enjoy their YAML configuraiton / directive files. </p><p>Using the <code>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</code> file I have been able to do full end-to-end testing by spinning up multiple docker containers, loading the databases, and running hundreds of test in just a few minutes. This was key in speeding things up in our team and enabling 5+ pushes to production per day.</p><p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Checkout Bitbucket here</a>.</p><h3 id="zerotier-for-vpn-control-plane">ZeroTier for VPN/Control Plane</h3><p>Finally, we come to the bit of tech that is largely optional but nice to have. &nbsp;Zerotier is a unique kind of network/VPN that I use to link all my personal machines. It works though firewalls (at home, in office) and offers an easy 1 minute setup.</p><p>Using ZeroTier in my last company we were able to remove the SSH Jump Servers which caused a headache in terms of key management and shared bandwidth on a single machine.</p><p>Zerotier work on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iPhone, so you are pretty much covered.</p><p>The one downside to ZeroTier is that I don't entirely understand how it works. It is a lot like MacOS or iPhone in that it "just works" as expected and I rarely (never) have problems. That is a strength from a user experience perspective but a WTF? from a CTO perspective. </p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Hopefully this deeper-dive will prompt some interest and curiosity about Docker, Django, Traefik, and especially IntercoolerJS. It is simple, easy to work with, and allows you to grow out of it when the time comes.</p><p>Edit 2021 - As you can see not a lot has changed. I've been able to add more code to my public repositories that flesh out the ideas expressed here over a year ago.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>The first batch of the repaired Raspberry Pi’s have been sold! If you missed out on this, don’t worry! There are more to come as I repair them. </p><p>I sold a total of 27 Raspberry Pi’s, 3 people cancelled their orders as they somehow thought these were Raspberry Pi 4’s?! I will relist these  during the week along with a few freshly repaired devices with upgraded SD card slots.</p></div>



<p>After ebay fees and P&amp;P the total was £400 which I have donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation as can be seen below, more will be coming in a future post to show what this money will go towards. </p>

<h2>Replacing and Upgrading Damaged SD Card Slots</h2>



<p>A large amount of the Pi’s had damaged SD card slots, the original slots are made of plastic which was fairly brittle in 2012 when they were released and they really haven’t aged well! </p>

<p>As can be seen on this image the slots have crumbled meaning they no longer hold an SD card. I managed to source the original SD card slots although the seller wanted £2 each for them which just wasn’t worthwhile. I managed to source upgraded metal SD card slots for £0.14p each on aliexpress here: <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33012711993.html</a></p>



<div><p>Removing the old SD card slot was easy, using a pair of snips I cut as much of the plastic away as possible leaving only the pins to remove. I did this using a soldering iron rather than hot air. </p><p>Installing the new SD card slot was equally as easy, the new slots don’t have the SD card detection switch built in meaning that the detection pads need to be bridged with Solder as can be seen in the image below:</p></div>

<p>Overall this was a very easy repair, I will post some detailed guides or maybe even videos on the repairs once I get through some of the backlog so don’t worry if this repair wasn’t in-depth enough for you. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>This SD card slots arriving from China allows me to repair a further 30 of the damaged Raspberry Pi’s which will be for sale soon – Remember that the profits from these sales goes to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>The pace will be slowing down a little once this batch of repairs are complete as I have some upcoming hardware reviews I need to prepare for which will be showcased in future posts. </p></div>



<p>As always please leave a comment and share your thoughts on the repair process. </p>

			<p><em>In this piece, author Jessica Flanigan makes the case that UBI is a better solution than raising the minimum wage, because UBI reaches all workers, paid and unpaid, and would also provide all workers the bargaining power to better choose where and how they want to work. — Scott Santens, Editor, BIT</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">latest jobs report from the BLS</a> reports a sudden acceleration of an ongoing trend of job growth, and unemployment in the US is now around 3.7 percent. Despite these impressive job numbers, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/04/if-real-wages-arent-rising-how-is-household-income-going-up/?source=post_page---------------------------">real wages remain low</a> for American workers. Perhaps in light of this, The U.S. House of Representatives passed the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democratic-push-to-raise-minimum-wage-opens-rift-over-amount-of-hike/2019/04/12/05711400-5d2d-11e9-98d4-844088d135f2_story.html?utm_term=.70a79b170fa0&amp;source=post_page---------------------------">Raise the Wage Act</a> this week, which reflects the goal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_for_$15?source=post_page---------------------------">Fight for $15</a> campaign: increase the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour.</p>
<p>The idea polls well. A <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/426780-poll-a-majority-of-voters-want-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">majority of voters</a> support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour as well. And most <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2020-democratic-candidates-embrace-a-15-minimum-wage?source=post_page---------------------------">2020 Democratic presidential candidates</a>, including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, support a $15 federal minimum wage too.</p>
<p>And it may seem that conditions are perfect for changing the federal minimum wage — unemployment is low, and the idea has a lot of support. But it’s worth thinking about proposals for a $15 federal minimum wage not only in light of Americans’ current economic circumstances but also in light of projected changes to the workforce going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>A higher minimum wage may benefit people who have jobs, but it doesn’t make life easier for people who aren’t workers. This is what makes the idea of a Universal Basic Income or Negative Income Tax a more promising route. Essentially, if we are interested in helping those most in need, we should focus on policies that put cash in all people’s pockets instead of just the pockets of hourly employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the advantage of these programs over a $15 minimum wage is that they benefit all citizens and do not disproportionately benefit workers and burden employers. And unlike other costly redistributive policies such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, UBI is better suited to reflect each person’s distinctive circumstances, preferences, and personal values. Below, I outline several reasons why more people should consider the UBI as a viable public policy.</p>
<p>Considering the UBI over the Fight for $15</p>
<p>Overall, the UBI does not rely on maintaining our current economic order in the way that policies that focus on benefiting workers do. This is an advantage because the economy is very likely going to change radically in the next century. Though today’s workers are <a href="http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-06-05-49-Of-Workers-Believe-AI-And-Automation-Will-Have-No-Impact-On-Their-Job?source=post_page---------------------------">not very concerned</a> about automation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17524822/robot-automation-job-threat-what-happens-next?source=post_page---------------------------">economists</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/06/automation-destroy-millions-jobs-change?source=post_page---------------------------">policy experts</a> argue that they should be.</p>
<p>Even if new technology does not cause significant job losses, workplace transformations associated with new technology are likely to have significant <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/?source=post_page---------------------------">political and economic consequences</a>. Tying the provision of public benefits to participation in the workforce needlessly raises the stakes of any policy that could change the composition of the workforce, and therefore increases the political and economic risks associated with automation. Moreover, the UBI doesn’t limit its benefits to people who are engaged in paid employment. This has four benefits that a higher minimum wage does not.</p>
<p>First, a UBI would benefit people who do valuable unpaid labor, such as childcare and eldercare, as well as people who are employees.</p>
<p>Second, a UBI would not interfere with workers’ and employers’ freedom to set the terms and conditions of their labor. If it is possible to benefit low-income Americans without restricting their freedom to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment relationships, officials should favor the less restrictive policies.</p>
<p>Third, a UBI would not tie people to their employers. This means that a basic income would potentially enable more economic mobility, enhance workers’ bargaining power, and enable people to stop working if they need to leave the workforce due to disability or caregiving obligations.</p>
<p>Fourth, policies that do not tie assistance to employment would not disproportionately burden employers. The debate over minimum wage increases is often framed as if employers are failing to benefit workers sufficiently. But low-wage work often helps low-skill workers more than anyone else. Without these employment opportunities, they would be even less capable of meeting their basic needs. If the justification for a higher minimum wage is that everyone should be able to support themselves, why should employers bear the full cost of meeting that goal? In contrast, a basic income enables citizens to share the cost of supporting a social safety net rather than treating employers as the only way to achieve it.</p>
<p>A significant benefit of a UBI, in contrast to other recent entitlement reforms such as student loan forgiveness and universal healthcare, is that it doesn’t tell people how to spend it. People have different values, but in-kind benefits assume that all people have the same interest in healthcare or being debt-free. This may be broadly true, but there are tradeoffs. Given the cost of these programs, it’s fair to ask whether people would be better off if we just gave them the money instead. But evidence from developing countries suggests that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/opinion/let-them-eat-cash.html?source=post_page---------------------------"> cash does help people better than alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>As I see it, the main challenge to a Basic Income proposal is affordability. Estimates vary, and some argue that a UBI would be <a href="https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/resource/universal-basic-income-proposals-in-light-of-ilo-standards-key-issues-and-global-costing-ess-%e2%94%80-working-paper-no-62/?source=post_page---------------------------">catastrophically</a> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/05/23/basically-unaffordable?source=post_page---------------------------">expensive</a> whereas others suggest that it is “<a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/basic-income-is-easily-affordable-8389995528b3?source=post_page---------------------------">easily affordable</a>.” Plausibly, while a UBI would save on administrative costs, it does seem that funding sustainable UBI could require making some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/04/of-course-we-can-afford-a-universal-basic-income-do-we-want-one-though/?source=post_page---------------------------#50c7d99f323c">hard choices</a> about other social programs such as healthcare, education, and defense.</p>
<p>The UBI and Social Security</p>
<p>UBI may seem like a radical idea, but there’s a precedent for it in America. Elderly people already receive what is effectively a basic income through Social Security. Some of them continue to work, while others use their basic income (and retirement savings) to pay their bills so that they can focus on spending time with loved ones or pursuing new hobbies. Some elderly people are disabled, and Social Security enables them to leave the workforce.</p>
<p>Yet older voters <a href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/435278-poll-most-voters-oppose-a-universal-basic-income-programs?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/375587-gallup-poll-americans-split-on-giving-a-universal-basic-income-to-workers?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> Universal Basic Income proposals while younger voters are in favor of it. Even more curiously, older voters <a href="https://www.pollingreport.com/social.htm?source=post_page---------------------------">consistently</a> <a href="https://socialsecurityworks.org/2019/03/26/social-security-polling/?source=post_page---------------------------">oppose</a> cuts to their basic income, Social Security. The difficult position for older voters is that the reasons for opposing a basic income are also reasons to oppose social security. And those who support Social Security should support a basic income as well. Those who oppose the UBI should rethink their support for Social Security. If anything, the case for a UBI is stronger than the case for Social Security because as it is currently structured, <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html?source=post_page---------------------------">Social Security may be a slightly regressive policy</a>, in part <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mortality-social-security-20180912-story.html?source=post_page---------------------------">because wealthy people live longer.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2014/09/political-authority-and-the-basic-income/?source=post_page---------------------------">Elsewhere</a>, I have argued in favor of a basic income because it is a kind of compensation for the injustices associated with our existing property system. In contrast, minimum wage requirements only compound the injustices of the current system by doubling down on the idea that elevates paid employment over other kinds of potentially valuable work, discourages opportunities for low-skilled workers, and leaves non-workers out of the social safety net. A basic income is more respectful of people’s freedom, more sensitive to recipients’ values, and better suited for a rapidly changing economy.</p>

                            <div>
                                
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The original version of this post highlighted the disadvantages of using a fixed key frame interval. I’ve since learned that this problem can be avoided using intra refresh in the H264 stream.</p>



<p>Streaming media. specifically video, is a fickle beast. This will be a short post, but it will cover everything you need to know to stream media using FFmpeg to WebRTC clients. This technique has many applications, such as streaming synchronized videos to users. </p>



<h2>Setting up the input</h2>



<p>Before inputting a file into FFmpeg, we need to pass a few flags:</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \</code></pre>



<p>These flags set the log level to info, generate pts if they’re missing, and sets up the protocols we can use. Next we need to provide the input to FFmpeg.</p>



<pre><code>-i in.mp4</code></pre>



<p>In this example, a file name <code>in.mp4</code> is used, but a http(s) URL could also be used. This command starts playback at the beginning of the input file. If you want to start playback in the middle of the input file, then you can add the <code>-ss &lt;time in secs&gt;</code> flag <strong>before</strong> <code>-i</code>.</p>



<h2>Video arguments</h2>



<p>Now the video needs to be converted to an appropriate format for streaming. The format is specific to the application, but common codecs are H264, VP8, and VP9. This example uses H264 due to its ubiquitous support.</p>



<pre><code>-vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
-map 0:v:0 \
-c:v libx264 \
-x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
-threads 3 \
-profile:v baseline \
-level:v 3.1 \
-pix_fmt yuv420p \
-tune zerolatency \
-minrate 500K \
-maxrate 1.3M \
-bufsize 500K \</code></pre>



<p><code>-vf</code> specifies the video filters to apply. Here, two filters are applied. The first is <code>realtime</code>, which causes playback to happen in real time, which is necessary for streaming. This filter is similar to the <code>-re</code> flag, but works much better with the start time flag (<code>-ss</code>). The second filter scales the video width to a maximum of 1280 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is important to keep the bitrate appropriate for real time streaming. </p>



<p>The <code>intra-refresh</code> parameter allows users to consume the video stream mid-way through by providing enough metadata over multiple inter frames to decode a full frame. The <code>fast-pskip=0</code>is required for <code>intra-refresh</code> to work if the source video files contains very few frames, which can happen if the video displays static images for long periods of time. There may be another way around this, but I’m not aware of it. </p>



<p>Another important parameter is the <code>-threads 3</code> flag. FFmpeg will use many threads by the default. Normally, this is good because it produces the final result as fast as possible. For real time encoding, however, using a large number of threads has some overhead that can slow down real time output. Using many threads is also a bad idea if you’re running multiple instances of FFmpeg concurrently.</p>



<p>The next two parametrs <code>-profile:v</code> and <code>-level:v</code> specify the profile and level to use for the encoding. These are specific to H264. WebRTC clients can only decode certain profiles and levels, so these need to match the specific configuration of the application. These roughly correspond to the profile-level-id of <code>42e01f</code>. </p>



<p>The pixel format is set to <code>yuv420p</code> using the <code>-pix_fmt</code> flag. This is required as this is the only pixel format supported by WebRTC. <code>-tune zerolatency</code> tunes the encoder for low latency streaming.</p>



<p>Next up are the bitrate parameters. When streaming media, the bitrate should be as low as possible while maintaining the desired quality. This ensures all clients can consume the video in real time. Omitting the <code>-minrate</code> parameter can cause FFmpeg to produce output with an unnecessarily high bitrate. Setting the <code>-maxrate</code> is equally important. A DSL connection can only pull down around 2 Mbps. In order for users to watch the video, they must be able to download it in real time, so the maximum bitrate has to be lower than the slowest connection among your users. Another consideration is that the streaming video might not be the only bandwidth consuming task on the user’s network.</p>



<h2>Audio arguments</h2>



<p>The audio arguments are much simpler.</p>



<pre><code>-af arealtime \
-map 0:a:0 \
-c:a libopus \
-ab 128k \
-ac 2 \
-ar 48000 \</code></pre>



<p>The main thing to note here is that the <code>arealtime</code> filter is used, which is similar to the <code>realtime</code> filter, but for audio.</p>



<h2>Output arguments</h2>



<p>The output can be piped to an RTP endpoint using the <code>tee</code> psuedomuxer. Unfortunately, FFmpeg does not support multiplexing over RTP, so you’ll need two separate RTP endpoints, one for the video stream and one for the audio stream. </p>



<pre><code>-f tee \
[select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;audio-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;audio-ip&gt;:&lt;audio-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;audio-rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;video-payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;video-ip&gt;:&lt;video-port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;video-rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now you can stream video over RTP! The full command is</p>



<pre><code>&gt; ffmpeg \
  -v info \
  -fflags +genpts \
  -protocol_whitelist pipe,tls,file,http,https,tcp,rtp \
  -i in.mp4
  -vf realtime,scale=w=min(iw\,1280):h=-2 \
  -map 0:v:0 \
  -c:v libx264 \
  -x264-params intra-refresh=1,fast-pskip=0
  -threads 3 \
  -profile:v baseline \
  -level:v 3.1 \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -tune zerolatency \
  -minrate 500K \
  -maxrate 1.3M \
  -bufsize 500K \
  -af arealtime \
  -map 0:a:0 \
  -c:a libopus \
  -ab 128k \
  -ac 2 \
  -ar 48000 \
  -f tee \
  [select=a:f=rtp:ssrc=1111:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;|[select=v:f=rtp:ssrc=2222:payload_type=&lt;payload_type&gt;]rtp://&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?rtcpport=&lt;rtcpport&gt;</code></pre>

  </p>


<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I recently switched my home office to a 2-by-4K HiDPI setup, like so:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg"><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/hidpi-setup.jpg" alt="A picture of my home office."></a></p>

<p>As part of that switch, I needed to configure parts of my Linux environment (which was originally
stock Ubuntu, but is now <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> with a heavily customized userspace) to function
correctly on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>This post will document most of the changes I applied. Hopefully others will find it useful for
their own HiDPI setups.</p>

<h2 id="90-of-the-way-x11-resources">90% of the way: X11 resources</h2>

<p>As it turns out, there’s a (nearly) one-stop location for configuring the default DPI for
X11 applications: the <code>Xft.dpi</code> setting.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to configure X11, but I personally use an <code>~/.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>Xft</span>.<span>dpi</span>: <span>163</span>
<span># not used directly; more on this later
</span><span>janus</span>.<span>fractionalDpi</span>: <span>1</span>.<span>63</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <code>163</code> and <code>1.63</code> are my DPI and its fractional form, respectively.</p>

<p>On my system, <code>~/.Xresources</code> gets loaded into the X resource database automatically by some
magic that I never configured. However, if yours doesn’t (or you use a different resource file),
you can always tell i3 (or your WM of choice) to load it explicitly with <code>xrdb</code>.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>exec</span> <span>--no-startup-id</span> xrdb ~/.Xresources
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With just this, about 90% of my applications (including GTK based ones, like Firefox) scaled
correctly and were usable without any font or custom scaling changes. Not bad for a single line!</p>

<h2 id="per-application-fixes">Per-application fixes</h2>

<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>

<p>Spotify’s Linux application is a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/">CEF</a>
shell. For reasons that are unclear to me, it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code> while normal Chromium
(via <code>snap</code> or <code>apt</code>) does.</p>

<p>To get it to scale correctly, I needed to pass <code>--force-device-scale-factor=1.63</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>spotify <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span>1.63
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it became clear to me that the fractional form of my DPI would be nice to set in
as few places as possible, to avoid duplication. Hence the <code>janus.fractionalDpi</code><sup id="fnref:hostname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hostname">1</a></sup> above,
and
<a href="https://github.com/woodruffw/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/spotify">this little <code>spotify</code> wrapper</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span># see the actual script linked above for some program-finding stupidity</span>
<span>real_spotify</span><span>=</span>/snap/bin/spotify

<span># grab the correct fractional DPI from the X resource DB</span>
<span>dpi</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>xrdb <span>-query</span> | <span>grep</span> <span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>hostname</span><span>)</span><span>.fractionalDpi"</span> | <span>cut</span> <span>-f2</span><span>)</span>
<span>"</span><span>${</span><span>real_spotify</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>--force-device-scale-factor</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>${</span><span>dpi</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>@</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> as my primary editor. As far as I can tell
it doesn’t use either GTK or Qt (or any other open-source GUI framework), which is probably why
it doesn’t respect <code>Xft.dpi</code>.</p>

<p>To get Sublime Text to scale correctly, I had to set <code>ui_scale</code> to the appropriate fractional DPI
in my user preferences (<code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Preferences.sublime-settings</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"ui_scale"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.63</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some lingering pain points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sublime Text’s input is noticeably laggy when the UI is scaled. It’s not so laggy as to be
unusable, but it’s definitely noticeable even if you aren’t sensitive to latencies (I’m not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mousing between Sublime Text and other windows causes noticeable stutter/hiccuping during
video playback. I haven’t dug into the X events yet, but my guess is that it’s got some kind
of pessimistic (and serial) <code>XFlush</code> or <code>XSync</code> that takes a decent bit of time on a larger window
buffer. It doesn’t happen with smaller windows (either floating or fixed).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="open-broadcaster-software-obs">Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</h3>

<p>I haven’t used it recently, but I used to use <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> to stream myself
working on open source projects.</p>

<p>When I switched monitors, I noticed that the embedded preview window for my scenes had stopped
working. OBS <em>itself</em> was still fully functional and the <em>separate</em> preview window still worked,
but the embedded preview was always filled in with black pixels.</p>

<p>After a decent bit of hair-pulling, I found a Qt environment variable that “fixed” it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR</span><span>=</span>0 obs
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I still don’t understand why that fixed it, but now my OBS is scaled correctly <strong>and</strong> has a
functional preview embed. I also posted this fix to the
<a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/bug-fix-black-preview-embed-window-on-linux-w-hidpi-monitors.135041/">OBS forum</a>.</p>

<h3 id="feh">feh</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/derf/feh"><code>feh</code></a> as my image viewer. By default, it seems to use
a bitmap font that’s incredibly small on HiDPI displays.</p>

<p>To fix it, I modified by default theme to use my distro supplied Ubuntu Roman-face font in
14pt.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/feh/themes</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>feh <span>--borderless</span> <span>--scale-down</span> <span>--conversion-timeout</span> 1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--fontpath</span> /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu <span>--menu-font</span> Ubuntu-R/14
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>One thing I haven’t figured out: when I open some higher-resolution images in <code>feh</code>, they’re
occasionally shifted to the right with transparent pixels where some of the image should be.
Clicking and dragging inside the image window causes it to re-render correctly, as does
resizing the window. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying.</p>

<h3 id="dunst">dunst</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://dunst-project.org/"><code>dunst</code></a> as my notification daemon.</p>

<p>It didn’t <strong>need</strong> any HiDPI-specific configuration, but I took the opportunity to make its
notifications slightly more readable on these newer displays.</p>

<p>In <code>~/.config/dunst/dunstrc</code> (among many other settings):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>monitor</span> = <span>0</span>
<span>follow</span> = <span>mouse</span>
<span>geometry</span> = <span>"600x120-30+20"</span>
<span>icon_position</span> = <span>left</span>
<span>max_icon_size</span> = <span>64</span>
<span>icon_path</span> = /<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>status</span>/:/<span>usr</span>/<span>share</span>/<span>icons</span>/<span>gnome</span>/<span>64</span><span>x64</span>/<span>devices</span>/
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="other-bits">Other bits</h2>

<h3 id="mouse-acceleration">Mouse acceleration</h3>

<p>My new displays are individually larger and significantly more dense than my previous ones, making
my mouse feel sluggish. I originally configured my mouse acceleration with
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/xset.1.html"><code>xset</code></a>, but at some point my
system switched to <code>libinput</code> and <code>libinput</code>-based inputs apparently don’t respect <code>xset</code> anymore
(or never did?). Sigh.</p>

<p>The fix is to use <code>xinput</code> instead, with either symbolic names or XIDs for the device and setting
being controlled. For example, this is what I use to set my mouse’s acceleration to the maximum
(<code>1.0</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>xinput <span>--set-prop</span> <span>"USB Optical Mouse"</span> <span>"libinput Accel Speed"</span> 1.0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your device and setting names may vary, of course, as may their value ranges (mine happened to be
<code>0.0</code> to <code>1.0</code>). You can use <code>xinput</code> on its own to list the names and XIDs of your devices;
<code>xinput list-props &lt;XID-or-name&gt;</code> can be used to dump a particular device’s properties and
their current values.</p>

<h3 id="i3-workspaces">i3 workspaces</h3>

<p>I use i3’s <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html">layout saving/restoring</a> functionality
to automatically load all of my workspaces and their applications when I log in.</p>

<p>Those layouts are stored in a (relaxed) JSON format via <code>i3-save-tree</code>, and contain hardcoded
coordinates. To update them for my new monitors, I just had to recreate each of my workspaces
once on my new monitors and dump them:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span># for each workspace (1A, 1B, ...)</span>
i3-save-tree <span>--workspace</span> 1A <span>&gt;</span> ~/.config/i3/workspaces/1A.json
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and then fix them up manually to enable the appropriate application swallowing rules.</p>

<h3 id="hexchat">HexChat</h3>

<p>I use <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/index.html">HexChat</a> for IRC.</p>

<p>HexChat’s config file includes individual offsets for each of the sub-panes in the GUI,
which means that it breaks badly if you change your monitor dimensions. I couldn’t figure out
how to fix them, so I ended up deleting my main <code>~/.config/hexchat/hexchat.conf</code> entirely and
recreating my preferred layout from memory. YMMV.</p>

<h3 id="system-icons">System icons</h3>

<p>I didn’t have to make any changes with respect to my system icon sizes, which is <em>probably</em>
because I actually see very few icons during normal i3 usage. Once again, YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="wrapup">Wrapup</h2>

<p>Switching from a set of 3 FHD monitors to two 4K HiDPI ones was <em>relatively</em> painless. The
problems that I had, unsurprisingly, were primarily with the few proprietary applications I use
needing to be spoon-feed DPI information in their own ways — every other problem was
either a bug (OBS + Qt) or a matter of more general reconfiguration.</p>

<p>
"Luck Surface Area" is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion
episode of <a href="http://www.techzinglive.com/">TechZing</a> a few months back and
is something I've been meaning to write
about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to
<a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/about/">Lance Jones</a>
who referenced the concept in a recent <a href="http://page99test.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/making-the-front-page-of-hn-without-even-trying/">blog post</a> I have finally been spurred into
action.
</p>
<p>
If there's one thing I've discovered in recent years it's this. The amount of
serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly
proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about
combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
It's a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one because what it implies is
that you can directly control the amount of luck you receive. In other words,
you make your own luck.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works. When you pour energy into a passion, you develop an expertise
and an expertise of any kind is valuable. But quite often that value can actually
be magnified by the number people who are made aware of it. The reason is that
when people become aware of your expertise, some percentage of them will take
action to capture that value, but quite often it will be in a way you would never
have predicted. Maybe they'll want to hire you, or partner with you, or invest in
you, or who knows what. But in whatever way it happens, it will be serendipitous.
</p>
<p>
But it's not just the expertise that's important, the very passion that created
the expertise has value in its own right. This is because people want to be excited
about things and passion is infectious. When you do something you're excited about
you will naturally pull others into your orbit. And the more people with whom you
share your passion, the more who will be pulled into your orbit.
</p>
<p>
To satisfy my mathematically oriented brain I've gone one step further and formalized
the concept into the equation L = D * T, where L is luck, D is doing and T is telling.
This demonstrates clearly that the more you do and the more people you tell about it,
the larger your Luck Surface Area will become. And while I like equations, it's the
graphical representation that really brings the concept home.
</p>

<p>We started wondering if we might have lost something in this transition. Sure,
machine learning covers a lot of ground but it is also capable of making bad
decision. We've also reached a stage of hype that folks forget that many
classification problems can be handled by natural intelligence too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">→</a>Background</h2><p>I recently got the chance to completely reset my Windows 10 machine, and took advantage of the
opportunity to create a dev environment I would love. These were my high-level goals:</p><ul><li>Make WSL my primary dev environment</li><li>Use VSCode as my primary editor</li><li>Have a beautiful terminal</li></ul><h2 id="wsl-%26-vscode"><a href="#wsl-%26-vscode">→</a>WSL &amp; VSCode</h2><p>To achieve this, I started by installing WSL 2. I went with an Ubuntu distro because that's what
I've had the most experience with in the past. You can find instructions on installing WSL and/or
upgrading it to WSL 2 in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">official
docs</a>.</p><p>Next I installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack">Remote Development extension
pack</a>
which is where things start to get fun. With this extension pack installed, you can edit files in
the WSL filesystem seamlessly with VSCode.</p><h2 id="windows-terminal"><a href="#windows-terminal">→</a>Windows Terminal</h2><p>To get my beautiful terminal going, I installed <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows
Terminal</a> (WT), which is an
awesome new terminal experience for Windows from Microsoft.</p><p>Although I wanted WSL to be my primary dev environment, I still wanted working in Windows to be a
nice experience as well, so I wanted to make sure my PowerShell terminal was great too. To get that
going, I also installed the latest <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-powershell-7-0/">PowerShell
7</a>.</p><p>Now it was time to setup my WT profiles. By default, WT creates a profile for WSL, PowerShell, cmd,
and Azure Cloud Shell. I'm not interested in using cmd or Azure Cloud Shell, and I'm going to be
using PowerShell 7 instead of PowerShell, so I disabled all but the WSL shell. To do this, simply
add the <code>"hidden": true</code> property to the profiles in the WT settings file (click the dropdown in the
header bar and then Settings or <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd></span>).</p><h3 id="powershell-wt-profile"><a href="#powershell-wt-profile">→</a>PowerShell WT Profile</h3><p>Now to create my PowerShell 7 profile, I added the following object to the profiles array:</p><pre data-language="json" data-index="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"guid"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>{346d54ee-6282-41c7-846a-0a2fa38ff66b}</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"name"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>PowerShell</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"commandline"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>pwsh.exe</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"icon"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>%SystemRoot%</span><span>\\</span><span>Installer</span><span>\\</span><span>{8B844F39-E6EE-486B-BE85-96A485AE2B96}</span><span>\\</span><span>PowerShellExe.ico</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>"startingDirectory"</span><span>: </span><span>"</span><span>D:</span><span>\\</span><span>code</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>A few things to note:</p><ul><li>To generate a GUID, you can use the <a href="https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx">Online GUID
Generator</a> website</li><li>I am using the <code>pwsh.exe</code> command instead of <code>powershell.exe</code> to use PowerShell 7</li><li>Follow these steps to find the icon path on your system:<ol><li>Open your Start menu and search for PowerShell 7</li><li>Right click on the app and click "Open file location"</li><li>In the file explorer that opens, right click the shortcut and click "Properties"</li><li>On the "Shortcut" tab, click the "Change Icon..." button and copy the file path</li></ol></li><li>I like to set the starting directory to be where I keep all my projects, and ideally this is near
the root of a drive to keep file paths as short as possible</li></ul><h3 id="ubuntu-wt-profile"><a href="#ubuntu-wt-profile">→</a>Ubuntu WT Profile</h3><p>Since I want to make WSL my primary environment, I moved its profile object to the top of the list
so that it will appear first in the new tab dropdown. Then I replaced the top-level <code>defaultProfile</code>
property with the WSL profile's <code>guid</code> property to make it the profile that is opened automatically
when WT launches.</p><p>Similarly to PowerShell, I wanted the starting directory to be <code>~/code</code>. If you try setting that
directly in the WT configuration, you'll find it doesn't work because WT doesn't know how to resolve
it. You can use an absolute path to get there instead, and you need to use a Windows file path that
WT can understand. You can access a WSL distro's file system from Windows using <code>\\wsl$\&lt;distro&gt;</code>, so, I added this property to the Ubuntu profile object: <code>"startingDirectory": "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\blake\\code"</code> (where <code>Ubuntu</code> should be replaced with the name of your WSL
distro and <code>blake</code> with your WSL username).</p><h3 id="wt-theme"><a href="#wt-theme">→</a>WT Theme</h3><p>Finally, I wanted to get a new theme for my WT. I decided I would like to use the same colour scheme
as I was using for VSCode at the time, which was the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl">Night
Owl</a> theme. So (naturally), <a href="https://chimerical.ca/posts/generate-windows-terminal-scheme">I
created</a> a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme">VSCode
plugin</a> to
automatically generate a WT theme.</p><p>Here's what my terminal looks like with the Night Owl theme:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><h2 id="shell-profiles"><a href="#shell-profiles">→</a>Shell Profiles</h2><p>Next up I wanted to get my shell profiles started. We'll iterate on these more later on. Your shell
profile is a script that gets run when the terminal starts which can be used to configure the
current environment. For PowerShell, this will be a PowerShell script and for WSL it will be a bash
script.</p><h3 id="powershell-profile"><a href="#powershell-profile">→</a>PowerShell Profile</h3><p>Let's start with PowerShell again. You can run <code>echo $PROFILE</code> to see if a profile script already
exists. For me it did, and it was located at
<code>C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</code>. If it doesn't exist for you,
it's not a big deal. It seems that PowerShell looks in a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/">variety of
places</a> and you
can just create a script in the appropriate place and it should work. Here's what I added to my
profile script:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="1"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value nano</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name edit </span><span>-</span><span>Value editor</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>profile_alias</span><span> { editor $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name profile </span><span>-</span><span>Value profile_alias</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>reload_alias</span><span> { </span><span>&amp;</span><span> $PROFILE }</span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name reload </span><span>-</span><span>Value reload_alias</span></span></code></pre><p>Let's break this down a bit. First of all, I am creating a couple aliases (<code>editor</code> and <code>edit</code>) for
my in-terminal editor. I prefer to use a terminal editor instead of a GUI editor because it reduces
context switching when working in the terminal, and is much faster to load the file to make a quick
edit. That said, if you wanted to use VSCode, you could replace <code>nano</code> with <code>code</code>.</p><p>The reason I create an alias for my editor command is so that I can change the editor at any time
and not have to change my muscle memory to use the new command. It also means I can create more
aliases that open the editor without having to change all of them if I change my editor.</p><p>Next, I add the <code>profile</code> alias which opens the profile script in my editor (the <code>editor</code> alias is
already coming in handy!). This is great because now I don't need to remember where my profile is
ever again, I can just run <code>profile</code> and can start editing it right away. I also add a <code>reload</code>
alias which simply reloads the shell using the profile script. This lets me use my changes to the
profile script without having to create a new terminal instance.</p><h3 id="bash-profile"><a href="#bash-profile">→</a>Bash Profile</h3><p>Now let's do the same thing for bash. In bash, the profile is a bash script located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
By default it contains a lot of stuff already, so I like to add my changes to the bottom of the
script. Here's what I added:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="2"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>nano</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> editor=</span><span>"</span><span>$EDITOR</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> edit=</span><span>"</span><span>editor</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> PROFILE=</span><span>"</span><span>~/.bashrc</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> profile=</span><span>"</span><span>editor </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> reload=</span><span>"</span><span>source </span><span>$PROFILE</span><span>"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>alias</span><span> explorer=</span><span>"</span><span>explorer.exe</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><p>This is very similar to the PowerShell script. First, we create an <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.
Some Linux programs respect the <code>EDITOR</code> variable, so it's a good idea to set it if you want more
programs to know which editor you want to use. Then we use <code>EDITOR</code> to create our <code>editor</code> and
<code>edit</code> aliases just like before.</p><p>Then, I add the same <code>profile</code> and <code>reload</code> aliases to edit and reload the profile script.</p><p>Finally, I added another alias which maps <code>explorer</code> to <code>explorer.exe</code> which makes it the same
command for opening the Windows File Explorer in WSL as in PowerShell.</p><h2 id="terminal-editor"><a href="#terminal-editor">→</a>Terminal Editor</h2><p>Let's revisit our terminal editor. I started with nano because it's a pretty intuitive and easy to
use editor for terminals. I don't have a lot of terminal editor experience, so I'm not very handy
with Vim, and even nano can be a bit awkward to use.</p><p>So, I did a bit of research to see if there were any editors that had more similar keyboard
shortcuts and navigation to a modern GUI text editor, like VSCode. I found
<a href="https://micro-editor.github.io/">micro</a> which is available cross-platform, which is perfect!</p><h3 id="powershell-editor"><a href="#powershell-editor">→</a>PowerShell Editor</h3><p>Let's install it. In PowerShell, it's most easily installed via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">scoop</a> or
<a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>. If you don't have either installed yet I'd highly recommend
you do, as it makes installing programs in Windows a much easier experience. I'm going to use scoop
for the purposes of this guide. With scoop installed, simply run <code>scoop install micro</code>. Now you can
run <code>micro</code> to edit your files.</p><p>Let's update our profile script to use it:</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="3"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Set-Alias</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span>Name editor </span><span>-</span><span>Value micro</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="ubuntu-editor"><a href="#ubuntu-editor">→</a>Ubuntu Editor</h3><p>To install on Ubuntu, we can run the install script from the micro website:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="4"><code><span><span>curl https://getmic.ro </span><span>|</span><span> bash</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can update our bash profile to use it:</p><pre data-language="bash" data-index="5"><code><span><span>#</span><span> ~/.bashrc</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> EDITOR=</span><span>"</span><span>micro</span><span>"</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="micro-theme"><a href="#micro-theme">→</a>Micro Theme</h3><p>One issue you might notice once you start editing in micro is that it's theme clashes with your WT
theme. One option could be to port your WT theme to micro, but this is quite a bit of work. I found
using the built-in <code>simple</code> theme uses your terminal theme's background colour and seems to fit
quite well for me.</p><p>To do this, you'll have to configure micro for PowerShell and WSL separately. To configure it, open
micro, press <span><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd></span> to open the command prompt, then enter the command <code>set colorscheme simple</code>.</p><h2 id="terminal-prompt"><a href="#terminal-prompt">→</a>Terminal Prompt</h2><p>Finally, to make our terminal really pretty, we need to customize the prompt. There's lots of
options out there for this, but the most popular one seems to be
<a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> for Bash and
<a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a> for PowerShell. I'm not a huge fan of
these because in my experience they slow down the terminal to a point which makes me frustrated to
use them, and since they are separate solutions for each environment they must be configured separately.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://starship.rs/">Starship</a>, a "blazing-fast," cross-platform alternative with a
delightfully simple prompt and some awesome customization (with the promise of even more coming in
future releases). Since WSL and PowerShell both have access to the Windows filesystem, we can even
store the Starship configuration in a central place and have both pull from it.</p><h3 id="powershell-starship"><a href="#powershell-starship">→</a>PowerShell Starship</h3><p>To install Starship for PowerShell, we can again use scoop: <code>scoop install starship</code>. To load
starship, we again need to edit our profile (now with our snazzy editor and single-command alias):</p><pre data-language="ps1" data-index="6"><code><span><span>#</span><span> C:\Users\blake\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Invoke-Expression</span><span> (</span><span>&amp;</span><span>starship init powershell)</span></span></code></pre><p>Now we can run our <code>reload</code> alias and see the beautiful prompt immediately.</p><h3 id="bash-starship"><a href="#bash-starship">→</a>Bash Starship</h3><p>Installing Starship for …</p></div></div>
