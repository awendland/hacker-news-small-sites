	<section>
<p><span>I became fascinated with guilds when I moved to Germany. Being an avid reader of all medieval history I could get my hands on, I was well aware of the <em>Hansa</em> (slang for Hanseatic) League’s rise in the 1100s in northern Europe – mainly Germany. The word&nbsp;<em>Hansa</em> is Low German for “convoy” – thus, this league of towns and merchant houses was a consolidated group of merchants and businessmen who strove to create their own answer to feudal Europe. The members of the League had their own legal system, their own armies, and had direct allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. Landed Barons and Earls did not stand a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>The rise of these independent towns and merchants also gave rise to the guild system. Where the Hansa League was a merchant’s guild, craft guilds began in a like manner around the same time period. The craft guilds were a system to protect knowledge that heretofore had been handed down by father to son, or nephew, or random laborer. Prior to the rise of larger towns and cities, just after the Dark Ages, it was difficult to form a “convoy” of skilled craftsmen because there was no system or codification of work. As towns grew, and more independent towns grew, the need for a steady flow of crafts began. Thus, craft guilds provided the goods and merchants fed the need: the beginning of real capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Both types of guilds, Merchants and Craftsmen provided a variety of important functions, very similar: “They established a monopoly of trade in their locality or within <img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3938" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds1/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg" data-orig-size="962,1500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NX530\/NX635\/BX535\/SX535&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=192" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=639" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=271&amp;h=422" alt="guilds1" width="271" height="422" srcset="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=271&amp;h=422 271w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=542&amp;h=844 542w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=96&amp;h=150 96w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=192&amp;h=300 192w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px">a particular branch of industry or commerce; they set and maintained standards for the quality of goods and the&nbsp;<a id="___id15" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp;of trading practices in that industry; they worked to maintain stable prices for their goods and commodities; and they sought to control town or city governments in order to further the interests of the guild members and achieve their economic objectives.” <em>(Encyclopedia Britannica)&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The craft guilds are of interest to Freemasons and those interested in Freemasonry because they have like terms. The use of the terms of Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master is well known, with slight variation, to Freemasons as well as to any member of a guild in the middle ages in Europe. These were the common terms to designate the proficiency of a laborer.&nbsp;Guilds in Medieval Europe employed the apprenticeship system of hierarchy, which has its origins in the Roman Empire and possibly Mesopotamia.&nbsp; From young ages, boys (and in some cases women, depending on the profession) were brought in to learn the craft, ensuring that an adequate number of skilled craftsmen were able to supply the growing towns with goods and services of equal and competitive quality. Standardization and quality were the driving force behind a steady stream of apprentices bonded to masters, and journeymen sent out to learn their craft.</span></p>
<p><span>The Apprentice was one who “apprehends” or takes hold of learning. One might also say it is one who is taken hold of, as he is bound to a Master to learn his trade. The term Apprentice does come from the Latin root of “apprehend,” and it does indicate in the <img data-attachment-id="3935" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds4/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg" data-orig-size="307,321" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=287" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=307" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=639" alt="guilds4" srcset="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg 307w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=143 143w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=287 287w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px">most basic terms “someone learning.” An Apprentice was one who learned for a specified amount of time, learning specific skills and techniques of both hand and mind. He was, however, not allowed to be an official member of the guild until he had satisfied the requirements set out by the guild and even more importantly, by his Master.</span></p>
<p><span>The word Journeyman has a more interesting etymology. A Journeyman is someone who does work for “another.” That is, he is an Apprentice who has been sent out into the world to work, generally for other Masters or shops. An original meaning of the word “journey” was “a day” and a Journeyman was someone who performed work for a day and then moved on, as it were. The Journeyman was no longer bonded to a single Master and could choose the work they wished to do. The Journeyman’s former Master, however, still guaranteed the Journeyman’s character and abilities. Shame on the Journeyman meant shame to the Master, and to the guild in which the Journeyman had become a member. Perfection in work and bearing meant the same perfection to the associated Master and Guild.</span></p>
<p><span>Master is an even more interesting term as used in the same time period (mid-16th Century) as these other two definitions. At this time, the term Master meant “one who controls or has authority.” It also meant “one who subjugates.” This means that a Master has perfected and honed his skills to the point of being competent in all areas of his craft, under all variety of conditions, with a variety of materials. A guild member might go their whole life being a Journeyman; Master’s were few and far between. A Master, then, is partially self-determined and partially a bestowed title.&nbsp;“A journeyman who could provide proof of his technical competence (the “masterpiece”) might rise in the guild to the status of a master, whereupon he could set up his own workshop and hire and train apprentices.

<p><span>The interesting thing is that the main function of the guild was not to produce goods or fix techniques ‘per se’ – those were supporting roles to the main function of the guild. The guild existed to serve a singular purpose:&nbsp;to train Apprentices. Bringing in and bonding Apprentices ensured a continuity of quality workmanship, consistent goods being produced, and traditions being maintained. Thus, the role of the Guild was not to form rules, mores, regulations, and laws with respect to their crafts; their role was to introduce a system of art or craft to a new individual, to instill in them the idea of standards, quality, consistency, and perfection. Their goal was to expand their horizons and technical knowledge in a specific area so they might provide for their towns as well as their families. Guilds and guild members served the community as much as they served themselves.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Repl.it is already the best place to build your apps. But there was a missing piece: where do you store your data?</p>
<p>We’re introducing Repl.it Database: a fast, free, and easy key-value store that’s built into every repl.</p>
<p>All you have to do is import one of our packages for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>, and you can instantly start setting keys in your database.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>Because Database is built-in, there is no setup, provisioning, or configuration. It's the fastest and easiest way to store data on Repl.it.</p>
<p>To get off the ground, fork our <a href="https://repl.it/@util/Database-Flask-comments-example">example Python and Flask emoji app</a> so that you can quickly get to hacking!</p>


<h2 id="key-value">Key-value</h2>
<p>Key-value databases are conceptually simple: they’re a flat map of keys to their values. There are no schemas, tables, or columns. There are only a few operations that you need to perform: set a key to a value, get a key’s value, delete a key, and search for keys.</p>
<p>Those simple operations are enough to support all kinds of applications, from blogs with posts and comments, to game backends with leaderboards, to <a href="https://repl.email/">email platforms</a>.</p>
<h2 id="multi-language">Multi-language</h2>
<p>We provide Database clients for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>. But you can talk to Database from any language over HTTP. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In Python, our client serializes and deserializes dictionaries and lists so that you can use them to store more complex data:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database2.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>Repl.it is the best place to start building your app. And Database is the easiest way to just jump in, get coding, and store your data without having to set anything up.</p>
<p>For more details on Database, click on the Database icon in your repl’s sidebar or <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">check out the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>With Database, you can build a fully-featured app entirely on Repl.it. We can’t wait to see what you create!</p>

With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been smoothed out — is SwiftUI finally ready for production?</p><h2 id="fruta-sample-app">Fruta Sample App</h2><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui">Apple’s Fruta example</a>, a cross-platform feature-rich app that’s built completely in SwiftUI. It’s great that Apple is finally releasing a more complex application for this year’s cycle.</p><p>I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it was pretty unpolished:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Since then, there have been many betas, and we’re nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. So it’s time to look at Fruta again. And indeed, the SwiftUI team did a great job fixing the various issues: The toolbar is pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works… however, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21">views are still sometimes misaligned</a>, and it’s still fairly easy to make it crash on both <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305051342596177921?s=21">macOS (FB8682269)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21">iOS 14b8 (FB8682290)</a>.</p><h2 id="swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">SwiftUI AttributeGraph Crashes</h2><p>Most SwiftUI crashes are a result of either a diffing issue in AttributeGraph, or a bug with one of the bindings to the platform controls (AppKit or UIKit). Whenever you see <code>AG::Graph</code> in the stack trace, that’s SwiftUI’s AttributeGraph (written in C++), which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Crashes there are usually in this form:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre> Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Googling for this error reveals that there are <a href="https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60">a</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171">lot</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/">similar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361">problems</a>. People sometimes do find workarounds via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. But mostly, we’re powerless, and this is something Apple needs to fix in its framework. Since SwiftUI ships as part of the OS, end users need to update their devices to get these fixes.</p><h2 id="platform-binding-crashes">Platform-Binding Crashes</h2><p>SwiftUI uses many components from AppKit and UIKit, which is a much better strategy than reinventing the wheel. These components are stateful and are synced with custom manager classes that perform the state diffing. These wrappers can cause issues, and as they’re written in Swift, there aren’t many possibilities to fix issues from the outside (unlike with swizzling in the earlier days).</p><p>Example: Removing a favorited item while it’s selected crashes in the AppKit binding that syncs the SwiftUI state with <code>NSTableView</code> (FB8684522).</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removing a favorite crashes the app immediately. <a href="https://t.co/i5wiMJr4XX">pic.twitter.com/i5wiMJr4XX</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305075451711369216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

Let’s look at Instruments!</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46551951d369616ff89d71678a98813dfcd2d94b/97d03/assets/img/2020/fruta-swiftui/instruments.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>Of the 10 seconds captured, 30 percent of them are used for the various retain/release and malloc calls in Swift and Objective-C.</li><li><code>NSAttributedString</code> shows up often in stack traces, which hints that text layout seems especially expensive.</li><li>The AttributeGraph SwiftUI layout engine seems to create a lot of throwaway objects. These might mostly be Swift structs, but they’re still expensive.</li><li>JPG decoding happens on the main thread, but it’s only responsible for less than 1 percent of the time spent here.</li><li>When checking Hide System Libraries, there’s basically no work done in Fruta’s business logic.</li><li>Sorting for Top Functions, we see that AppKit’s auto layout logic, combined with SwiftUI’s graph, is taking up a lot of time.</li><li>There seems to be a lot of unnecessary invalidation. For example, <code>AppKitToolbarCoordinator</code> adds a toolbar item, which triggers <code>NSHostingView.preferencesDidChange()</code>, causing everything to lay itself out once again, even though the toolbar size doesn’t change.</li></ul><p>The good news is there seem to be a lot of potential future optimizations possible to make this fast. Alternatively, there’s always the possibility of <a href="https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1304938866999046144?s=21">dropping out of SwiftUI for performance critical parts</a>.</p><p>This isn’t unique to Fruta.

He <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1301802048824979456">stopped development</a> because it’s so slow that it’s not shippable. I did some debugging with an earlier version of Big Sur where the app still somewhat worked:</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The AppKit port of SwiftUI is... not very efficient.

I’m currently working on making our <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/">PDF SDK for iOS</a> easier to use with SwiftUI, and we’ll replace the settings/about screen of <a href="https://pdfviewer.io/">PDF Viewer</a> with a SwiftUI version.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t yet go all-in on SwiftUI for production apps, although the crash rate is likely manageable and Apple is actively improving things with every release. Remember that SwiftUI ships with the OS, not with your app, so any bug fixes will only help if your users update the OS.</p><p>Other ports are not so great. AppKit seems particularly troublesome, but I’ve also heard of big issues with tvOS. If you need to deploy your app to the Mac, use Catalyst, which is a much more stable binding and feels really good with Big Sur’s native mode, where content is no longer scaled.</p><p>If you’re curious about SwiftUI, <strong>please don’t let this dampen your enthusiasm</strong>. It’s extremely fun to write, it’s clearly the future at Apple, and all these issues will surely be resolved within a few years.</p></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>This post shows how I upgraded the power delivery to my home server room, as well as installing the infrastructure to replace 5 UPS's around my house with just one large UPS.</p><p><strong>Why Upgrade the power?</strong></p><p>The electrical in my home when I moved in was terrible, it was also Aluminum and has been incorrectly terminated by some house flipper, here is a great example of what I have come up against. Do you really want to use this outlet? Probably not.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-17_12.40.16.jpg"></figure><p>The 15a circuit that powers the server room was also shared with the <em>refrigerator </em>for some reason. I have a pretty large fridge which pulls quite a lot of power when the compressor kicks on, this means my inbox is spammed with emails from my UPS complaining about the spikes in power when the compressor turns on and off</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-11-10_30_31-Inbox---sean@bondhou.com---Outlook.png"></figure><p>I finally reached the end when I charged some Milwaukee batteries in the server closet and it tripped the breaker, I decided to go all out and get a ton of power in the room.</p><p><strong>Why the multi room UPS setup? </strong></p><p>There are many reasons this makes sense, this addresses all of the issues I had with my old setup of having UPS's scattered around the house.</p><p><strong>Batteries</strong></p><p>No longer will I have to keep track of batteries in 5 different UPS's all with different expiration dates. It will also save me money as the total number of batteries is much less in one large UPS.</p><p><strong>Noise</strong></p><p>This seems crazy, but some UPS's like the APC SMT line make a slight hum all the time, its very quiet but in a silent room you can hear it, this is super annoying. With this setup the UPS can be as loud as it wants, its in my server rack in its own room</p><p><strong>Space</strong></p><p>Do I really want 2 UPS's sitting under my desk? No. It also lets me cable manage much better</p><p><strong>Load</strong></p><p>When me and my wife are playing PC games, the load can get to the upper limit of a single UPS, meaning I'd have to buy a second one, and then both UPS's would be only half loaded. By having one large UPS, I can size it properly for all the loads</p><p>There could be some drawbacks though, here is all I could come up with</p><p><strong>Single Point of failure</strong></p><p>By having one large UPS, if the UPS fails, everything goes down. I decided this was okay, as my entire network lives in the closet and is only powered by a single UPS anyway, so if the network goes down, everything else is essentially down anyway. So I felt like there really wasn't any increased risk here. Also, UPS's in general are pretty bulletproof, especially enterprise grade units.</p><p><strong>Code compliance</strong></p><p>There are several points here that probably don't comply with code. The fact that an extension cord has been brought into a permanent circuit is probably one of them. I decided this wasn't a real risk as that SOOW cord is 1000x tougher than romex. I would argue that romex in the wall is of greater risk of getting damaged from someone running a screw or a nail to hang a picture frame</p><p>9/14/2020 Update - I believe this is actually to code - <a href="https://www.electricallicenserenewal.com/Electrical-Continuing-Education-Courses/NEC-Content.php?sectionID=111.0">https://www.electricallicenserenewal.com/Electrical-Continuing-Education-Courses/NEC-Content.php?sectionID=111.0</a></p><p>The other one is that the outlets are now not AFCI protected. I am unsure if the UPS protects against this, but I don't think it does. This could possibly be resolved by running the UPS from an AFCI breaker, but I am unsure. Either way I don't really care about this part, the chance of that kind of failure is low, especially when I did a good job installing everything. Its also still a 1000000x safety improvement over the old wiring in the room</p><p>There also could be something said for the fact that if you shut the breaker off, the power keeps flowing from the UPS. This however is only a risk to people who don't know about the setup, and since its my house, everyone does. If I were to sell the house, I could simply remove the inlets.</p><p><strong>The Install</strong></p><p>First I had to figure out how exactly I was going to get UPS power from my server closet, to somewhere else. I found you can get pretty cheap Power Inlets which are often used for block heaters on cars, and for RV power inputs. I got one of these and drilled a hole in a blank metal wall plate, and made a pretty good inlet</p><p>You can buy this kind of thing pre-made for flush TV mounting, but they seem lower quality and are way more expensive.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-19-19.51.58.JPG"></figure><p>I got the highest quality extension cord ends I could find so this would be fine plugged in 24/7. These are in there SUPER tight.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-19-19.52.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.06.46.JPG"></figure><p>I then got myself a reel of 12/3 SOOW cable. This stuff is SUPER thick and SUPER tough. Its overkill for this in every way, but given that these will be hanging on the floor in the server room, I figured the tougher the better. As it turns out, buying good quality USA made extension cords is pretty much impossible, so you have to make your own</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-30-10.46.44.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.04.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.09.JPG"></figure><p>The downside with these super heavy duty cord ends is that they don't fit well in compact locations, like when I was testing with this SMT1500 UPS. As you can see, you can't use the outlets above and below</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.07.19.JPG"></figure><p>Next I had to find a way to mount all of these in the wall, plus the regular power oulets I wanted to run. Since they rely on the single metal plates, I can't use a 4 gang box that attaches to the stud. In the end I decided to use a piece of 3/4" inch plywood paired with some old work boxes that just clip into the hole. The ply wood will span the studs and get screwed in</p><p>I measured everything out, cut some holes with a holesaw and then finished up with my jigsaw</p><p>I decided I wanted the 4 inlets, a single gang for the 30a power I will supply, and two double boxes for the 20a circuits</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-14.54.45.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-14.54.13.JPG"></figure><p>Then I cut out the drywall in the server room, plus another hole on the other side to make thing easier. The hole on the other side was more to scout the correct position in the server room, and you could probably skip it</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.36.08.JPG"></figure><p>With that done, I simply screwed it in with 4 screws and inserted the old work boxes. As you can see, I also spray painted the wood white to somewhat match the wall</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.52.27.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.52.24.JPG"></figure><p>Its not the neatest thing in the world, but honestly it doesn't have to be.</p><p>I brought the cables down through the top of the wall through a few 1/2 holes. I used 12/2 Romex for all of the inlets and the 20a power circuits, and 10/2 for the 30a</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-11.29.20.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-20.04.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-20.03.10.JPG"></figure><p>Here it is with everything installed and labeled up</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.26.22.JPG"></figure><p>I went with the 30a in the middle for a large UPS, and then decided to pull 2 x 20a circuits. One for the server rack in general (Currently I don't have the 30a UPS) and then also an extra one for general use. This lets me plug whatever I want in, without affecting the power to the rack</p><p>Some may ask why the outlets are installed upside-down, its common in commercial settings to do this as it means if the cord sags down, only the ground prong will be exposed. Things can also get lodged between the two hot prongs if the outlet is the normal way up, like this from an image I stole from reddit</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/image.png"></figure><p>Here is the first test of the UPS power</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.25.03.JPG"></figure><p>And then all the way on the other side of the house, the dedicated outlet under the desk lights up</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.24.40.JPG"></figure><p>Overall I am super pleased with how this has turned out. </p><p>If anyone has any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me from the contact page</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 13, 2020</p>
  <p>This post describes my own pet theory of programming languages popularity.
My understanding is that no one knows why some languages are popular and others aren’t, so there’s no harm done if I add my own thoughts to the overall confusion.
Obviously, this is all wild speculation and a just-so story without any kind of data backed research.</p>
<p>The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn’t really matter.
What matters is characteristics of the runtime — roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?</p>
<p>To start, an observation.
A lot of software is written in vimscript and emacs lisp (<a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> being one example I can’t live without).
And these languages are objectively bad.
This happens even with less esoteric technologies, notable examples being PHP and JavaScript.
While JavaScript is great in some aspects (it’s the first mainstream language with lambdas!), it surely isn’t hard to imagine a trivially better version of it (for example, without two different <code>null</code>s).</p>
<p>This is a general rule — as soon as you have a language which is Turing-complete, and has some capabilities for building abstractions, people will just get the things done with it.
Surely, some languages are more productive, some are less productive, but, overall, FP vs OOP vs static types vs dynamic types doesn’t seem super relevant.
It’s always possible to overcome the language by spending some more time writing a program.</p>
<p>In contrast, overcoming language runtime is not really possible.
If you want to extend vim, you kinda have to use vimscript.
If you want your code to run in the browser, JavaScript is still the best bet.
Need to embed your code anywhere? GC is probably not an option for you.</p>
<p>This two observations lead to the following hypothesis:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity.
The quality of the language itself is secondary.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Let’s see some examples which can be “explained” by this theory.</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd>
<p>C has a pretty spartan runtime, which is notable for two reasons.
First, it was the first fast enough runtime for a high-level language.
It was possible to write the OS kernel in C, which had been typically done in assembly before that for performance.
Second, C is the language of Unix.
(And yes, I would put C into the “easily improved upon” category of languages. Null-terminated strings are just a bad design).</p>
</dd>
<dt>JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>This language has been exclusive in the browsers for quite some time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dd>
<p>This case I think is the most interesting for the theory.
A common explanation for Java’s popularity is “marketing by Sun”, and subsequent introduction of Java into University’s curricula.
This doesn’t seem convincing to me.
Let’s look at the 90’s popular languages (I am not sure about percentage and relative ranking here, but the composition seems broadly correct to me):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://matklad.github.io/assets/lang-pop.png" alt="lang pop">
</p>

</div>
<p>On this list, Java is the only non-dynamic cross-platform memory safe language.
That is, Java is both memory safe (no manual error-prone memory management) and can be implemented reasonably efficiently (field access is a load and not a dictionary lookup).
This seems like a pretty compelling reason to choose Java, irrespective of what the language itself actually looks like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go</dt>
<dd>
<p>One can argue whether focus on simplicity at the expense of everything else is good or bad, but statically linked zero dependency binaries definitely were a reason for Go popularity in the devops sphere.
In a sense, Go is an upgrade over “memory safe &amp; reasonably fast” Java runtime, when you no longer need to install JVM separately.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there are also some things which are not explained by my hypothesis.
One is scripting languages.
A highly dynamic runtime with <code>eval</code> and ability to easily link C extensions indeed would be a differentiator, so we would expect a popular scripting language.
However, it’s unclear why they are Python and PHP, and not Ruby and Perl.</p>
<p>Another one is language evolutions: C++ and TypeScript don’t innovate runtime-wise, yet they are still major languages.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s make some bold predictions using the theory.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, I expect Rust to become a major language, naturally :)
This needs some explanation — on the first, blush, Rust is runtime-equivalent to C and C++, so the theory should predict just the opposite.
But I would argue that memory safety is a runtime property, despite the fact that it is, uniquely to Rust, achieved exclusively via language machinery.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, I predict Julia to become more popular.
It’s pretty unique, runtime-wise, with its stark rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy">Ousterhout’s Dichotomy</a> and insisting that, yeah, we’ll just JIT highly dynamic language to suuuper fast numeric code at runtime.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dart grows.
On the one hand, it’s roughly in the same boat as Go and Java, with memory safe runtime with fixed layout of objects and pervasive dynamic dispatch.
But the quality of implementation of the runtimes is staggering: it has first-class JIT, AOT and JS compilers.
Moreover, it has top-notch hot-reload support.
Nothing here is a breakthrough, but the combination is impressive.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, I predict that Nim, Crystal and Zig (which is very interesting, language design wise) would not become popular.</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em>, I predict that Swift will be pretty popular on Apple hardware due to platform exclusivity, but won’t grow much outside of it, <em>despite</em> being very innovative in language design (generics in Swift are the opposite of the generics in Go).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s assume you made a static website made in <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> for instance. Or maybe you made a JavaScript application in one of the popular frameworks <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>… etc. It may be a simple side-project or just an app for learning, but it always
comes to the problem where to host it, which provider to use, and which
provider offers most features for free so you can show to everybody your work.</p>
<p>Well, it’s 2020 and it has never been easier to host your static website for
free. Each one differs in some way but essentially they all offer the same
service, so we created a list of 18 free hosting providers that you might
consider for your current or next project.</p>
<p>Are you using some of these providers? Let us know in the comments on your
experience with them.</p>
<h2 id="1-aws-s3httpsawsamazoncoms3">1. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">AWS S3</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon AWS</a> is probably one of the most known hosting providers on the internet,
even if you don’t choose AWS, chances are you’ll end up on AWS since many of
the providers below are built on top of them. So instead you may consider
hosting your website directly on AWS.</p>
<p>AWS is completely free for the first year of use, after that, you get charged
for what you use.</p>
<h3 id="free-plan-includes">Free plan includes:</h3>
<p>Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5GB of Amazon S3 storage in the S3
Standard storage class; 20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST
Requests; and 15GB of Data Transfer Out each month for one year.</p>
<h2 id="2-netlifyhttpswwwnetlifycom">2. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> gained a good reputation in the developers’ community for their
hassle-free service and a very generous plan with plenty of features. It’s an
all-in-one platform offering Analytics, Forms, Serverless functions, and much
more.</p>
<p>FYI, <a href="https://devandgear.com/">Dev &amp; Gear</a> is hosted on Netlify.</p>
<h3 id="free-plan-includes-1">Free plan includes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>100GB/month of bandwidth</li>
<li>300min/month of build time</li>

<p>Org 9.4 is out.  <a href="https://orgmode.org/Changes.html" title="Enjoy">Enjoy</a>!</p>

<p>Most of the time, when you hear that a free software project is
struggling, it is too late.  E.g. both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ip17pu/looking_for_a_maintainer_for_pdftoolstablist/" title="pdf-tools">pdf-tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2386" title="helm">helm</a> don't have a
maintainer since a few days: did you see this coming?</p>

<p>Org is doing quite well, but I feel we are at a turning point: either
we attract more contributors and we can afford to fix more bugs and
deliver new releases, or we might get overwhelmed by user requests and
lose both our energy and our motivation to continue.</p>

<p>Of course, part of this problem is my limited free time over the past
few years: don't worry, I am no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" title="BDFL">BDFL</a> and I will soon step down as the
maintainer.  Also, other core contributors have been more active than
I was able to be, so I guess my feeling is still valid, even for when
I won't be contributing anymore.</p>

<p>I think it boils down to this: we are not very good at <strong>helping you
help us</strong>.  So, here is my modest attempt at getting better at this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <strong>you are a power user</strong> but no Elisp hacker, can you <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode" title="subscribe to</li>
  the mailing list">subscribe to</a></li><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode" title="subscribe to</li>
  the mailing list">
  the mailing list</a> and help answering questions and reproducing bug
  reports?  I cannot insist enough on this: it really helps <em>a lot</em>.
</ul>

<p>Of course, you are also welcome to <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-web-social.html" title="help people on Stackoverflow and
  on Reddit">help people on Stackoverflow and
  on Reddit</a>, but <em>upstream help</em> on the mailing list is decisive to let
  code contributors focus on their contributions.</p>

<ul>
<li>If <strong>you are an Elisp hacker</strong>, can you help us fix bugs?  Here is a</li>
  list of <a href="https://updates.orgmode.org/#bugs" title="confirmed bugs">confirmed bugs</a> that you can <a href="https://updates.orgmode.org/feed/bugs" title="subscribe to (as RSS)">subscribe to (as RSS)</a>.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>If you have <strong>better ideas</strong> on how to let anyone contribute more, can</li>
  you send a patch against <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html" title="the org-contribute page">the org-contribute page</a>?  See <a href="https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/" title="worg.git">worg.git</a>.

<li>If money is not an issue for you, can you <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/donate.html" title="make a donation">make a donation</a>?  Yes, it</li>
  does help.
</ul>

<p>Also, if <strong>you already contribute</strong> to Org with code, emails on the list

  don't be shy and add yourself to <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/donate.html" title="the donation page">the donation page</a>.</p>

<li>If <strong>you have feature requests</strong>, they are also welcome, but at the</li>

<p><em>Do you know why social media sites are so addictive? Yeah, sure, let’s cover the basics: they’re flooded with funny memes and short-form videos that play themselves when you scroll, all of your friends are on social media, and besides, where else to nag about your recent Uber experience? But there is something else entirely that’s keeping you inside Facebook and Twitter like a crackhead inside a drugstore – immediate feedback. Sadly, this same thing, is also the reason you abandon your <a href="https://durmonski.com/life-advice/long-term-thinking/">long-term projects</a>.</em></p>



<p>A lot of times writing, to me, feels like sitting alone and talking to myself. I write stuff, I publish them, and nothing really happens. <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The lack of feedback</a> – good or bad – makes me doubt the work I do. It immediately instills negative thoughts that whisper in my head, “Go do something else, you suck at writing. You see? No one is noticing.”</p>



<p>The same is with any other form of venture if you’re just starting. You open an online shop, you carefully arrange your categories, you sit, and you wait. Unless you market the shit out of your brand new site, no one will notice what you did – except probably your mom. If you want to make sales, you need to basically purchase your own stuff in the beginning.</p>



<p>But this is not limited to business, this same principle applies if you want to lose weight, learn a new language, a new skill, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/">adopt a new habit</a>, and anything else that can potentially make you a better human being.</p>



<p>“Good things take time,” others say. But being patient in the world of reactions without delay is hard. It takes true heroism to keep working on a project for years until you finally <em>make it</em>.</p>



<p>The lack of immediate feedback, or any form of feedback for that matter, can crush your enthusiasm and get you back to the drawing board. That’s why social media platforms feel so good and so many people sit inside. You publish something, and you immediately get some sort of response or reaction. Yes, you can only get a few likes but it surely feels a lot better than writing for years till someone notices, or restlessly sweating in the gym till you finally <em>get </em>that shred body.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there is a way to overcome the devastating thoughts that consume your mind when there’s no response from users and keep working on your business idea. You just need to shift your perspective and use the three-year rule.</p>







<h2><strong>What’s The Three Year Rule</strong>?</h2>



<p>Nowadays, we expect things to happen overnight. We have same-day deliveries, instant messaging, a quick way to buy things online, leave a review, get a refund, and above all we see people who worked as bank clerks, as if it were yesterday, but today, these same people run a multi-million dollar business.</p>



<p>Media outlets emphasis only on the last part of creating a project – the part where people are now successful. They don’t talk enough about the long hours, the doubt, all the hard work. They try to sell you the idea that you, too, can make it big. And I’m not saying that you can’t, but it will surely take a lot more time than what the online gurus are telling you.</p>



<p>That’s where the three year rule comes in.</p>



<p>There’s nothing fancy about this command. It will simply give you a different perspective when you want to make a project successful or make some positive changes in your life.</p>



<p>Instead of hoping to succeed till the end of the month, and be disappointed when this doesn’t happen, give yourself the opportunity to make it. Give yourself three years.</p>


<div id="ub_click_to_tweet_d948d44f-7576-4384-80fc-c740963b536a"><p>Instead of hoping to succeed till the end of the month, and be disappointed when this doesn’t happen, give yourself the opportunity to make it. Give yourself three years.</p></div>






<h2>Why The Three Year Rule is Important?</h2>



<p>Ask any successful person. Ask any experienced person. They’ll all tell you the same thing – It takes time to create something valuable. Something worth doing.</p>



<p>Yet, we’re not able to accept this narrative. We want things to happen right now because everything around us is moving so fast. </p>



<p>When we begin working on a project, start learning something new, when we open our online store, we want to see results. We want to see some sort of progress because progress means that what we’re doing is working. That our efforts are not in vain. </p>



<p>Of course, things don’t work like that. Reality is different from our expectations. Progress is slow, sales are stagnant, people are not commenting on our new blog post… When these things happen, naturally, we start to lose faith in what we’re doing and we abandoned things.</p>



<p>But the problem is not that our work suck – at least this is not the main issue – or because we’re not doing the right things, it’s simply because we’re entering the project with the wrong expectations. We expect things to happen fast, and when they don’t – which is normal – we blame the market, our customers, our spouse, and we close shop.</p>

They expect quick results and when reality does not meet their expectations, they give up.</figcaption></figure>







<p>But things can be way different if we reframe our expectations. If we enter this project, any project, with reasonable expectations. </p>



<p>Instead of hoping for overnight success, we need to accept reality. To tell our instant-feedback-craving minds that it takes time to create something lasting. </p>

<p>Right from the start, set the right expectations. Don’t aim to succeed this month, neither this year, plan to succeed after 3 years.</p>







<h2>How To Apply The Three Year Rule?</h2>



<p>Commit to doing something for 3 years. 5 years. Even 20 years.</p>



<p>The number of years is not that important – of course, it should be at least a couple of years so you can make some real progress. The most important thing is to set the right expectations right from the start. To convince your mind that it will take time to see results.</p>



<p>Here are some actionable steps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What?</strong> Start with what you want to do and why you want to do it. Opening an online shop surely feels exciting but if your main ambition is to make money, and nothing else, you won’t last long. You need a strong motive. Something that will inspire you to wake up every day at 5 in the morning. Something that will motivate you to <a aria-label="keep you going despite the obstacles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/overcoming-obstacles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep you going despite the obstacles</a>.<span id="easy-footnote-1-8884"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-8884" title="Read <a href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/start-with-why/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Start with Why (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Start with Why</a> by Simon Sinek for more actionable strategies on this."><sup>1</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>Commit:</strong> Allow yourself at least 3 years to do the above. Good things take time. There’s no such thing as an overnight success. The stories we read online are showing us only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the water, there’s always years of hard work. If you’re not willing to commit at least 3 years to a project, save yourself some time and money and don’t start at all.</li><li><strong> Say no:</strong> Once you know what you’re going to do, say no to things unrelated to your main goal. Say no to other opportunities. Say no to emerging business trends. And be firm when you say it. This step is crucial. If you stay open for opportunities you won’t make any progress. Close all windows of opportunity and stay committed to your long term goal.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Don’t blindly follow the path you originally set. It’s normal for our mission to be flawed at first. After all, we didn’t have any experience in the field initially. When we actually start working on the project, we’ll know better. So, after a couple of months, when we see the flaws in our original idea, once we know what’s not working, and what’s not going to work, make the correct adjustments and move forward.</li></ul>



<p>These are the basics.</p>



<p>For reference, and inspiration, let me share how things look for me at <a href="https://durmonski.com/">durmonski.com</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What?</strong> I see more and more people obsessing about trivial stuff – cheap clothes, gadgets, video games, famous people with no real values, the latest trends, etc. Sadly, The more we consume this type of hollow content, the more ambitionless we became. We settle for Netflix and chill, and we don’t have any desire to make something lasting. I want to even things out. I want to be a source of quality content that can help more people realize that they can do so much more with their time. My drive since the beginning of this site is to create thought-provoking content that will inspire and help folks become more rational.</li><li><strong>Commitment:</strong> I started in 2018 and my original commitment was to work on the site for 3 years. It’s been 2 years, but progress is slower than I thought. And while I often feel down about the lack of big results, my original commitment changed to 5 years. Why keep doing it since results are low? Because I can see myself doing this type of work for at least another 10 or 20 years. I love it and I often receive praise from readers. With this in mind, I’m fine with waiting for 2-3 more years to see results.<span id="easy-footnote-2-8884"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-8884" title="I say that the progress is slow because I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of visitors to my site. Hence, a lot of <a aria-label=&quot;members (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/membership/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>members</a>. Getting a lot of traffic usually happens when you have a lot of sites linking back to your site. And this process, unfortunately, takes time."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>Say no: </strong>Every now and then, I have an idea for a new project. A concept for a new site that seems way better than what I’m currently doing. But instead of going forward with the new ideas, I write them down. In most cases, after just a few days, I realize that this new concept is not going to work and I feel even more inspired to work on my main goal.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> When I first started this site, I was publishing mainly articles about <a aria-label="how to become a minimalist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/the-remedy-for-modern-busyness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to become a minimalist</a>, how to travel with less, all the minimal stuff. I did it because it was trendy back then. My goal was still the same back then – help people get out of the consumerist mindset. However, after a couple of months, I realized that I want to write about slightly different things. Put simply, I was trying to be someone I’m not initially. So, I’ve made some adjustments. The main mission didn’t change much but my daily actions did. The content I publish now represents truly who I am.</li></ul>

<p>There isn't a great pullquote here, because the whole thing is ridiculous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While out at a nearby cafe in smoke-engulfed Vancouver, I noticed that the screen on my partner's 2015 13" MacBook Pro had experienced some delamination. She's also been complaining about her battery life, and since the computer had just run out of that, and since I had the same screen problem resolved under their repair program, I decided to start up a chat with Apple Support to see if they could assist us.</p>
<p>To be clear, the vast majority of my experiences with Apple Support have been pretty good. Sometimes it takes a little bit of work, but I've generally ended up better off than before with few exceptions. This was the single most dissapointing interaction I've had with any tech support rep as far as I can recall. The numbers Joe suggested in this conversation are either entirely fabricated, or belong to the cost of replacing the entire machine if its experienced catastrophic damage. But, after clarifying numerous times about what the numbers actually represent and comparing to previous repair bills for the same issue, my belief is that the rep used a false and obscured repair order to persuade me to replace my girlfriend's minimally damaged screen with a new computer.</p>
<p>I'm sorry ahead of time for the entire transcript taking the form of a number of screenshots, but after trying to wrangle Acrobat Pro for far too long in order to redact the sensitive information, I just took the shortest path.</p>
<p>Also, after re-reading, I did make some minor grammatical errors and typos, particularly when asking for clarification on the cost of the 2019 MBP screen repair. This should be the $2051.84 from the post screenshot.</p>
<p>All dollar amounts are in <strong>CAD</strong></p>

Here it is below, for both my 2019 MBP 13" and the 2015 model that spurred the conversation. My main issue here, is that it's just a number and a payment request, there isn't any way to confirm the very confident claims made by the support rep. Is it really just a top case replacement? Probably not, considering previous top case replacements have only run between $500 and $1000.</p><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png 1062w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-2.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png 691w"></figure><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-3.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>But what's it for!?</figcaption></figure><p>Here also is a copy of a previous repair bill, this time for a logic board and display assembly replacement under warranty.

                    <p>What this article is about, what I assume you to know, how the article is structured and how it is to be used.</p>
                    <div id="section_intro">
                      <p>The Conjugate Gradient method is one of the most important ideas in scientific computing: It is applied for solving large sparse linear equations, like those arising in the numerical solution of partial differential equations 
                        and it is also used as a powerful optimization method.

                      <p>This article is trying to give an intuitive introduction to the <span>Conjugate Gradient method.<span>from now on often abbreviated as "CG"</span></span></p>
                      <p>The CG method is based on a beautiful geometric idea but this idea is barely explained in most exposition texts, a fact that was lamented (and alleviated) by Jonathan Shewchuk's grandiose paper "An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain". 
                        This article tries to transfer Shewchuk's brilliant explanations into a more interactive medium. 
                      </p>
                      <p>Note that this article is designed to be read on a decently sized monitor. While a phone screen will show the necessary info, there are some features and visualizations that might not work satisfactorily.</p>
                      <p>If you find errors, have comments on the mathematical and/or didactical exposition, please drop me an email at contact@pwacker.com.</p>
                      <p>I assume you need this algorithm for one of the following use-cases:
                        </p><ol>
                          <li>Solving a linear system of equations \[A x = b\]for a matrix \(A\in \mathbb R^{n\times n}\) 
                            symmetric and positive definite and vectors \(x, b\in \mathbb R^n\). This setting typically arises when you need to solve partial differential equations numerically.</li>
                          <li>Minimizing a quadratic function \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^T x + c\] with a matrix 
                            \(A\in \mathbb R^{n\times n}\) symmetric and positive definite, vectors \(x, b\in \mathbb R^n\) 
                            and a scalar \(c\in \mathbb R\)</li>
                          <li>Minimizing a more complicated function \[f : \mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R.\]</li>
                        </ol>
                          <p>The first two cases are equivalent (<span><i onclick="clickMinimizeUnminimize(['equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'], this, event)" onmouseout="unhighlightParent(document.getElementById('equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'), col='lavender')" onmouseover="highlightParent(document.getElementById('equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'))"></i> </span>).</p>
                          <p>
                            Note that the quadratic function is differentiable and has gradient \(\nabla f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(A^T + A)x - b = Ax - b\) (last step by symmetry of \(A\)) and (by positive definiteness of \(A\)) 
                            is guaranteed to have exactly one minimum which needs to fulfill \(\nabla f(x) = 0\). Hence, minimization of \(f\) amounts exactly to solving the linear equation \(Ax = b\).
                          </p>
                          <p>Although CG was developed for minimization of quadratic functions, it is
                            applied to non-quadratic minimization problems as well.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Obviously, the solution to \(Ax = b\) is \(x = A^{-1}b\) but we assume that the dimension \(n\) of the problem 
                            is so high that we cannot invert the matrix. From here on, we won't allow matrix inversion as a feasible operation. We even forbid 
                            explicitly solving linear equations of the form \(Ax = b\). This is not the same as inverting \(A\) and multiplying \(A^{-1}b\) and is a lot 
                            faster than that, but we assume that the problem is so big that even this will not work.
                            We allow, on the other hand, all kinds of (valid) multiplications between vectors and matrices and assume that those can be 
                            done efficiently.
                          </p>
                          <p>Because the CG method is most intuitively understood in the context of optimization, we will drop the \(Ax = b\) aspect for now and 
                            we will mostly look at the problem of minimizing a quadratic function of the form \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^T x + c.\]
                            We also make the standing assumption that \(A\) is square, symmetric and positive definite. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Because we assume that exact solution of the minimization problem (or equivalently, solving the corresponding linear equation) cannot be done efficiently, 
                            we will look at <emph>iterative methods</emph>, i.e. we will construct an iteration \(x_{i}\mapsto x_{i+1}\) such that the sequence 
                            \[ x_0, x_1,x_2,\ldots\] converges to the minimum.

                        <p>We are going to discuss iterative optimization methods, i.e. we will construct
                          a sequence \[x_0, x_1, x_2,\ldots\] such that

                        <li>The error \(e_i\) is a quantity used in theoretical analysis of the optimization algorithms but is inaccessible for each concrete optimization problem.</li>

The Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance believes naming heat waves will bring more attention to the threats they pose.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Frederic Larson/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But heat can present a more insidious threat, Baughman-McLeod said. "We call it the silent killer," she&nbsp;told <a href="http://cbc.ca/day6"><em><u>Day 6</u></em></a><em> </em>host Brent Bambury.</p>  <p>According to a <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125937/">recent study out of Duke University</a></u>, heat-related illnesses are responsible for more than 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S.</p>  <p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control, meanwhile, puts that number at approximately 600. Baughman-McLeod says the lower number is likely the result of underreporting given many health record-keeping systems don't allow for heat-related mortality and morbidity in most places.</p>  <p>"Part of the challenge is that we don't keep records of heat-related illness and death, and oftentimes you would show up to the emergency room with a heat illness and it would be categorized as a kidney failure or a heart attack," she said.</p>  <h2>Protecting the most vulnerable</h2>  <p>Several cities — including Athens, Tel Aviv and Melbourne — and international climate organizations have signed on in support of the alliance's naming goal.</p>  <p>Those living in cities are more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Cities are built from materials that trap heat and lead to a "heat island effect" that can increase temperatures by up to 8 C, sayid&nbsp;Baughman-McLeod.</p>    <p>She believes that naming heat waves could help create measures that protect those most vulnerable to the heat, including those living in cities without access to air conditioning or other ways to cool down.</p>  <p>"Farm workers and delivery workers and construction workers ...&nbsp;wouldn't be expected to work during a named heat wave where they are," she said as an example.</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Area residents capture video along the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as the city's skies are blanketed with smog and debris from wildfires throughout the state.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:45</span></span></span></p>  <p>With a name, she argued, news and social media could more easily elevate awareness of a heat wave.</p>  <p>But not everyone agrees on what is considered extreme heat, a challenge Baughman-McLeod is aware of.</p>  <p>She says that for this to work, an international framework must be created. From there, regions will be able to adapt what is considered extreme to their own climate.</p>  <p>"It will be about local conditions and the people who live in those areas there, what they're used to," she said.</p>  <p>When the U.S.-based Weather Channel began naming winter storms, there was <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74744/why-it-controversial-name-winter-storms">disagreement</a> among meteorologists and scientists. While Baughman-McLeod acknowledges that it has presented some challenges, she believes her group is working to develop the best framework.</p>  <p>"We are in discussions with those groups of scientists and researchers, applied scientists, climatologists, heat-health scientists, social scientists," she told <em>Day 6.</em></p>  <p>"We will 100 per cent depend on science- and data-informed strategy to get to heat wave naming."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Jason Vermes&nbsp;with files from The Associated Press.

<p>Freetype, included in the <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">font stack on
Unix</a>, is quite
complex. There are so many layers to get it to do what it does that
it’s easy to get lost. From finding the font, to actually rendering it,
and everything in between.<br>
Like most of the world, I use a rather low screens definition
(1366x768 with 96 dpi) and rather old-ish laptop, unlike some <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/">font
designers that live in a filter bubble where everyone has the latest
macbook</a>. Thus, good and legible font
rendering is important.<br>
Let’s play with lesser known toggles available to us when it comes to font
rendering and see what they do, let’s have fun and explore possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="a-general-picture">A General Picture</h2>

<p>Generally, to make a font look better on screens, which are arrays of
pixels, we use a combination of these three:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Antialiasing</strong>: Applying a light shade around the glyph. It is useful
at small scale, when you don’t have enough pixels, but it makes most
glyphs look bolder.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_antialias.jpg" alt="Font anti-alias example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subpixel rendering</strong>: A technique similar to antialias but using
subpixels, the color components inside the pixels. By applying a
small amount of colors on the sides you can reach more granular
precision. However, if applied clumsily, or if you simply move the
window containing the text, these colored subpixels will become
apparent, what we call fringe.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_subpixel_rendering.jpg" alt="Font sub-pixel rendering example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hinting</strong>: Pixels are blocks but text is made of curves, that means
these curves will never match exactly with screen pixels. Hinting
is about repositioning or selecting the closest pixels while trying
as much as possible to keep the shape of the glyph intact. There are
multiple levels of hinting, hinting information provided by the font
itself (bytecode interpreter hinting), and hinting provided by the
rendering library (auto-hinting).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_hinting.jpg" alt="Font hinting example" loading="lazy"></p>

<p><em>NB</em>: “It’s just text”… This article is yet another that
shows how fonts aren’t as easy as they look.  For more info
about the font stack, please visit <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">my previous article on the
topic</a>, and if you
want an idea of what it means to draw them on the screen take a look a
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2018/09/02/fonts-xcb.html">this article</a>.</p>

<p>What is applied, when, how to control all of this, can we see what they
do, and should we even care?</p>

<p>Freetype and fontconfig default rendering these days is pretty good,
so there shouldn’t be anything to worry about; Until there’s something
to worry about, like a font not looking the way you want.<br>
Our first stop will be something that intrigued me because I haven’t
heard many talk about it: the Freetype driver’s properties.<br>
The Freetype driver is used whenever hinting is needed, so this is the
part it actually changes — how hinting is applied.</p>



<p>Let’s start with arming ourselves with ways to easily test all this.<br>
Freetype2 demos utilities are a must, you can clone them
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/09/14/git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2-demos.git">here</a>
or fetch them from your package repositiory, for example
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/freetype2-demos">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2-demos/">Arch
Linux</a>.<br>
These will give you a bunch of useful tools such as <code>ftdiff</code>, <code>ftview</code>,
<code>ftstring</code> <code>ftgrid</code>, <code>fttimer</code>, <code>ftbench</code>, and others. The most important
ones for us are <code>ftdiff</code> and <code>ftgrid</code>.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 20 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftstring <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-m</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, you can install <code>pango-view</code> from <code>pango-tools</code>
to later test if fontconfig applies your configurations
properly. It can be used by preparing a file written in <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html">pango
markup</a>
and displaying it using <code>pango-view --markup file.pangpang</code>.<br>
You can set the fontconfig debug level higher to see which font is
actually loaded by setting the <code>FC_DEBUG</code> to something like 4096,
<code>FC_DEBUG=4096</code>.</p>

<p>More values can be found here, we’ll use them later to see if our
fontconfig settings are applied properly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="man">Name         Value    Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------
MATCH            1    Brief information about font matching
MATCHV           2    Extensive font matching information
EDIT             4    Monitor match/test/edit execution
FONTSET          8    Track loading of font information at startup
CACHE           16    Watch cache files being written
CACHEV          32    Extensive cache file writing information
PARSE           64    (no longer in use)
SCAN           128    Watch font files being scanned to build caches
SCANV          256    Verbose font file scanning information
MEMORY         512    Monitor fontconfig memory usage
CONFIG        1024    Monitor which config files are loaded
LANGSET       2048    Dump char sets used to construct lang values
MATCH2        4096    Display font-matching transformation in patterns</code></pre></figure>

<p>Yet another way is to test directly in your browser URL bar:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml">data:text/html,<span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf8"</span><span>&gt;&lt;p</span> <span>style=</span><span>"font-family: Times New Roman;"</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-freetype2-drivers-properties">The Freetype2 Drivers Properties</h2>

<p>So let’s get back to our testing of Freetype2 drivers.<br>
On <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-properties.html">this documentation
page</a>,
ft (freetype) properties are listed and are said to affect the behavior
of the drivers, each touching a different one. They are set by modifying
the <code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</code> environment variable, normally loaded from
<code>/etc/profile.d/freetype2.sh</code>.<br>
However, most of the ones listed are targeted at the CFF, Type 1,
and CID fonts driver and not at TrueType fonts, so they do nothing
if you don’t have these font types. The only toggle <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-tt_driver.html">available for
TrueType</a>
is the <code>interpreter-version</code> which controls the bytecode interpreter,
the rasterizer, and thus how the outline gets hinted.</p>

<p>The options available to us are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>35 — For classic mode GDI (Win 98/2000)</li>
  <li>38 — GDI+ old (Vista, Win 7), Infinality, considered slow</li>
  <li>40 — For minimal mode (stripped down Infinality, this is the default)
(After Win 7)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of weird that we jump from 35 to 38, where did 36 and the rest go? The
answer is that it’s a choice from the Freetype devs to only include those
and not the ones in between.</p>

<p>And the differences look as follows, notice the native hinter in the
left column:</p>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v40.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We can also test using <code>pango-view</code> (remember again that this should be a font
that has native hinting enabled but not the auto-hinter):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;span</span> <span>font_family=</span><span>"Times New Roman"</span> <span>font=</span><span>"10"</span> <span>foreground=</span><span>"black"</span> <span>alpha=</span><span>"83%"</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can also change the font via the <code>--font=</code> argument of <code>pango-view</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> pango-view <span>--markup</span> text.bangarang</code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v35.png" alt="pango interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v38</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v38.png" alt="pango interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v40</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v40.png" alt="pango interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>So definitely, older interpreter versions were rougher with hinting, much
bolder, and could deform the glyphs. The newer ones are more minimal with
it. We also notice that the auto-hinter isn’t that bad and that avoiding
hinting can help. I took the specific case of the Windows font ‘Times New
Roman’ because it has the reputation of rendering badly with Freetype,
mostly because of the job the interpreter does. Applying very light or no
hinting at all helps tremendously, even at very small point size as you
can see in the next comparison. The hinting does indeed help legibility
at this scale but the font shape and personality is completely destroyed.</p>

<p>From left to right: v35, v38, v40.</p>

<h2 id="how-fontconfig-works">How Fontconfig Works</h2>

<p>We’re not done with hinting yet, there can be many levels of hinting
that can be applied, but let’s first take a detour and learn a bit about
fontconfig and how to use it.</p>

<p>Fontconfig is the layer in the font stack responsible for loading the
font along with the configurations that tell the next layer how to find
the font file and what changes to apply when rendering it. It is usually
composed of a library, a preset of configuration files, and a bunch
of helpful tools all starting with the prefix <code>fc-</code> such as: <code>fc-cache</code>,
<code>fc-query</code>, <code>fc-match</code>, and <code>fc-conflist</code>, to name a few.</p>

<p>The configuration files are usually found in <code>/etc/fonts/</code> and split into
the presets available <code>/etc/fonts/conf.avail</code>, and the chosen presets in
<code>/etc/fonts/conf.d</code>, which are symbolic links to the former.<br>
The precedence of the rules is alphanumerical, a first-come
first-served principle, thus <code>01-custom-rule.conf</code> will be loaded
before <code>99-not-important-rule.conf</code>. Local user configurations, in
the user’s <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig</code> directory, are loaded from
one of these configurations that contains an include statement. On
my machine it is the <code>50-user.conf</code>, so it’s precedence is lower
than anything loaded before it. This isn’t practical when testing
rules so rename this file to something like <code>01-user.conf</code>. Now
anything you put in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d</code> or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> should have priority.<br>
You can make sure the order and configurations are loaded properly by
using the <code>fc-conflist</code> command. It lists in order of precedence the
configurations found, the ones starting with a <code>+</code> are loaded, the ones
with <code>-</code> are not.</p>

<p>These files are composed of mainly 4 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match rules: If something matches, then edit the properties
mentioned. There are ton of matching and editing rules, even including
stuff like the program name that is currently trying to load …</li></ul></article></div></div>

</header><p>
I was mystified when I first came across the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/hint.html">“Most Inflationary”</a> winning
<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/">entry</a> in the 2018 <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.  Written by the <a href="https://bellard.org/">incredibly prolific</a> Fabrice
Bellard, this tiny program with just 4KB of source code emitted a
128×128 resolution version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#Criticism">(in)famous</a> Lena test image.  Voodoo!
The IOCCC judges wrote “We could understand some of the arithmetic but none
of the magic.”  I was determined to figure out the magic and inspired by
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard</a> to try to write up how it works.
</p>

<p>
Using the program is straightforward enough, and both the source and the
details of running it can be found on its IOCCC page.  I used GCC to
compile it and piped the output directly to ImageMagick to view it:
</p>

<div>
<pre>gcc -O3 -o prog prog.c
./prog | display -                        # Show embedded image
./prog d &lt; vintage_cars.bin | display -   # Show an external image
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running it with no arguments like the first case will decompress the
embedded data and produce the following image (zoomed for detail):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/image.png" alt="image.png">

</figure>

<p>
Admittedly, this has a fair number of compression artifacts, but it’s still
pretty darned impressive for 2439 bytes of image data and 1544 bytes of
source code for the decompressor.
</p>

<p>
So let’s see how it works.  This will be a deep dive and by far my longest
post yet (I’ve erred on the side of too much detail), so make
yourself comfortable!  From here on in, I’m going to show the pieces of the
original program juxtaposed with the corresponding pieces from my
deobfuscated version.  When I mention line numbers, I’ll be referring to
the later unless noted otherwise.  I’ll typically use italicized numbers in
parenthesis to denote these.
</p>

<p>
For my version I have expanded the lone macro (used to compact <code>for</code>
loops), reformated the source, and renamed the variables.  The only
structural changes that I have made are from updating to modern style
function headers and pushing declarations down to be as local in scope as
possible (C99 style).  In one case, I gave a variable different names when
pushing it down into two blocks where it had been reused in different ways.

We’ll start at the end of the program with the <code>main()</code> function and then
work our way backwards to the beginning; we’ll essentially go from top to
bottom in terms of control flow.  Here’s the <code>main()</code> function:

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The image is basically encoded in two distinct layers.  The lower level
uses a lossless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy encoding</a> scheme that stores only single bits and
unsigned integers.  We’ll see this in detail later.  For now, it’s enough
to know that the first line (<i>230</i>) checks for an argument to determine
whether to expect the image on standard input or to decompress the image
from an internal string.  The data is stored slightly differently in the
two modes and the related value here doubles as a flag.  The second line
(<i>231</i>) then primes the pump for the decoding this bitstream.  (However,
this turns out to be superfluous as it would have been called later
anyway.)
</p>

<p>
At the higher level, the first thing to be decoded (<i>232–236</i>) is a small
header comprised of four integers.  The first of these stores the image
width as a power of two.  Due to a fixed-size array used to store the
decompressed image, the width is limited to 1024.  The second integer
stores how many lines shorter the image height is compared to the width.
This will be zero for square images but means that only square or landscape
oriented images are possible.  The next two lines decode a pair of
parameters related to the image quality.  Higher numbers here give greater
compression at the expense of image quality.  The lowest legal values for
each are 1 and should produce near lossless results.  For the built-in Lena
image, the four values in this header are 7, 0, 41, and 82, respectively.

<div id="text-org4f12528">
<p>
The decoded image is written to standard output in the form of a PPM file.
This is a <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html">wonderfully simple format</a> for writing that consist of a small
header indicating the image type, resolution, and maximum color value.  A
single <code>printf()</code> suffices for this (<i>238</i>).  Following this, the image
data itself is simply a series of unsigned bytes in interleaved RGB order
for each pixel and the pixels in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
(<i>245–247</i>).  Because of the lossy format, the decompressed RGB values may
fall outside the 0 to 255 range, so a small helper function is used to
clamp and then write them:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>109: </span><span>K</span>(b){
<span>110: </span>putchar(b&lt;0?0:b&gt;255?255:b);

<h2 id="orgf3b7761">YCgCo Color Space</h2>
<div id="text-orgf3b7761">
<p>
The compressed image data is not actually encoded using the usual RGB color
space, though of course it outputs this at the end.  Instead, it uses the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCgCo">YCgCo</a> color space.  This is easily transformed back to RGB (<i>244–247</i>) but
has some nice properties where image compression is concerned.  Notably,
it decorrelates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance">chroma</a> data.
</p>

<p>
To see this, lets look at the just the Y (luma) color channel of the
built-in image.  We can do this by zeroing out the Cg (green–magenta) and
Co (orange–blue) chroma channels before transforming back to RGB:
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Note how the result is simply the image in greyscale.
</p>

<p>
We can also look at the Cg channel in isolation by setting the Y values in
all pixels to 128 and the Co values in all pixels to zero.  This will show
us how the Cg data looks added to a neutral grey image:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/cg.png" alt="cg.png">

</figure>

<p>
And we can do likewise to view the Co channel in isolation by setting the Y
values to 128 and the Cg values to zero:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/co.png" alt="co.png">

</figure>

<p>
Hopefully it is clear now why this transform is useful: the majority of the
actual image detail is contained in the Y channel with only a little bit in
the Cg and Co channels.  Moreover, the human eye is more sensitive to
luminance than chrominance so by separating these out the encoder can
compress them with different degrees of lossiness.  This is why there are
not one but two image quality factors (<i>235–236</i>).
</p>

<p>
Many lossy image and video codecs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Downsampling">JPEG</a>, offer an option called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">chroma subsampling</a>.  When used, the luminance channel is typically stored
at full resolution while the chrominance channels are downscaled and stored
as a lower resolution image by the encoder, then upscaled by the decoder.
The tiny image decoder doesn’t bother with this.  Instead, the encoded
images just crank up the lossiness factor for the chrominance channels
(which JPEG images usually do too).
</p>

<p>
It’s also worth noting (<i>241–243</i>) that the decoder decompresses
the Y, Cg, and Co channels to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar format</a> in memory before writing the
transformed RGB values in the PPM-required <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_pixel">interleaved</a> form.

The actual extraction of the image to these planes in memory occurs
completely within the function called at line 237.  This is the main

<p>Why Should I Care?</p>



<p>Applications, even databases come and go, but data is the most important part of the story. Usually, data is the purpose of the system exists in the first place. That’s why we should consider a database system not only as a black box to hold our data, but also a tool to verify and guard it against corruptions.</p>



<p>This is achieved with a help of robust and well-thought database design. Of course, business logic is coded in the application layer and it makes sure data is in a proper format before arriving at the database. But who guarantees that a network failure or a bug will not allow corrupted “guests”? Also, the application layer is not the only “door” to the database. We can have import scripts, maintenance scripts, and mere mortal DBAs and developers interacting with it. Having preventive measures at a very low level ensures our data is always checked before stored.</p>



<p>Having robust, reliable data also helps with development and testing. Setting a column as a Not Null excludes many test scenarios assuming the emptiness of that column and also simplifies code freeing developers to check value [nearly] every time before accessing it.</p>



<p>Having stressed the importance of good database design, let’s have a look at the tools at our disposal to achieve it.</p>



<p>Normalization</p>

<p>This is of no doubt the first rule of good design. We are not going to delve into normalization rules here, just want to emphasize it’s importance. A good piece of reading about the topic could be&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/access/database-normalization-description" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article.</a></p>



<p>Data Types</p>



<p>Defining proper types for attributes is another thing that needs attention. This will not only improve the performance of the database but also validate the data before storing it. So we should keep numeric data in “integer”, “numeric” fields. Timestamps in “timestamp”, “timestamptz” fields. Booleans in “bit”, “char(1)” or “boolean” (whichever RDBMS supports) fields, etc.</p>



<p>Dates deserve a specific mention. If a Date attribute is supposed to have only the date part (OrderDate, ReleaseDate) use a type without a time portion (“date”). If you need to keep only the time (StartTime, EndTime) use a suitable time type. If you don’t need precision specify it as zero (“time(0)”). The problem with dates having a time portion is that you always have to cut off the time part to display only the date and make sure not to display yesterday or tomorrow when you format it in a different timezone than your database. Dates with time portion also may cause problems with subtracting and addition when hopping over daylight change dates.</p>

<p>Constraints</p>



<p>Constraints are our main topic of discussion today. They are what keeps invalid data out and ensures the robustness of it. Let’s look at them one by one.</p>



<p>Not Null Constraint</p>



<p>If business rules state that attribute should always be present, make it Not Null without hesitating. Good candidates to be Not Null are fields like Id, Name, AddedDate, IsActive, State, CategoryId (if all items should have a category), ItemCount, Price, and many others. Usually, these attributes play important roles in business logic. Other optional informative fields may still be Null.</p>



<p>But be careful not overusing Not Null constraint for attributes that CAN BE Null. For example, a long-running Task always has a StartTimestamp (Not Null), but EndTimestamp is updated only when the task finishes (Null). Or another classic example: Employee table has ManagerId, but not all employees have a manager. Don’t be tempted to make ManagerId Not Null and insert “0” or “-1” for employees that don’t have a manager. This will lead to other problems down the way when we will be adding Foreign Key constraints.</p>



<p>Unique Constraint</p>



<p>Again, depending on business rules, some attributes (or combinations of attributes) should be unique, such as Id, PinNumber, BookId and AuthorId, OrderNo, etc. These attributes should be made unique by adding Unique constraints. One more note: you may use Unique Index to achieve the same effect, but adding constraint is a better approach. Because when you add a Unique constraint a non-unique index is created automatically. So if for some reason you would have to temporarily disable/enable the constraint it’d be very easy. In the case of a unique index, you would have to drop/recreate the index which is an expensive operation in terms of performance degradation and time.</p>



<p>Primary Key</p>



<p>Not Null and Unique constraints together make up a Primary Key. Columns like Id or ObjectId quickly come to mind when we think of primary keys. But primary keys can also be composite, like BookId and AuthorId. The dilemma here is whether to have a separate Id column as a primary key, or make a composite primary key of them both? Having a separate Id column is usually a better method as it makes your joins cleaner and also allows easily add another column to a unique combination. However, having a separate primary key (Id) doesn’t free us from the need to add a Unique constraint to BookId and AuthorId columns.</p>



<p>Check Constraint</p>



<p>Check constraints allow us to define valid values/ranges for data. Perfect candidates for check constraints are Percent (between 0 and 100), State (0, 1, 2), Price, Amount, Total (greater than or equal to 0), PinNumber (fixed length), etc. Again don’t try to code business logic into check constraints. I remember a case when adding a Check constraint “greater than or equal to zero” to the AccountBalance column saved us from accidental over-drawing balances.</p>



<p>Default Constraint</p>



<p>Default constraints are also important. They allow us to add new Not Null columns to existing tables and make the “older” API to be compatible with the new structure until all parties are upgraded (though after complete upgrade default constraint should be removed).</p>



<p>One thing to remember here. Don’t code business logic into a Default constraint. For example function “now()” can be a good fit (though not always) as a default value for a Timestamp field in a Log table, but not for an OrderDate field in an Orders table. You may be tempted to omit OrderDate in inserts, relying on a default constraint and this means spreading your business logic down to the database level. Also at some point business may decide to assign OrderDate only after it has been approved and because the Default constraint is buried deep into the database it will not be obvious when we make changes to the code in the application layer.</p>



<p>Foreign Key Constraint</p>



<p>Foreign Key constraint is the king of the relational database design. Together with Primary Keys, Foreign Keys ensure data consistency at the inter-table level. Normalization rules tell us when to extract data into its table and reference it with Foreign keys. Here we will focus on subtle nuances, like OnDelete and OnUpdate rules.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easy part: OnUpdate. Foreign keys reference primary keys and they are rarely (if ever) changed. So the OnUpdate rule is not very popular, but it makes sense to set it to Cascade, as sometimes we may have to update the primary keys of some rows (usually after migration). This way database will allow us to make the update and new ids will be propagated to the child tables.</p>



<p>OnDelete rule is a bit more complicated. Depending on the database we have options NoAction, Restrict, SetNull, SetDefault, and Cascade. So which one to choose?</p>



<p>NoAction is usually selected for keys referencing lookups or entities that can exist without referencing entity. For example, Products -&gt; Categories, Books -&gt; Authors, etc. Restrict in most cases is the same as NoAction, though for some databases there’re subtle <a href="https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/on-delete-restrict-vs-on-delete-no-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">differences</a>.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Cascade is selected when child records can not exist without their parent. In Book and Author example, when a book is removed we should remove records from the BookAuthor table too. Other examples: OrderDetails -&gt; Orders, PostComments -&gt; Posts etc. Here some of you may disagree that the database should not automatically remove child rows, they should be removed by the application layer. Depending on business logic, yes, that’s true. But sometimes “unimportant” child deletions can be delegated to the database.</p>



<p>SetNull is rarely used. For example, the Foreign key between Employee.ManagerId and Employee.Id can be Set Null. When a manager is removed (if ever) his subordinates become orphans. Obviously, this rule should be selected only if the column is nullable.</p>



<p>SetDefault is the rarest among his counterparts. It sets the column to its default value when the parent record is removed. Because foreign keys reference primary keys we can hardly imagine a hard-coded default value for a field with a foreign key. But anyway this option exists in case we need it.</p>



<p>Indexes</p>



<p>Indexes are an important part of good database design, but a bit off-topic for our discussion, as they do little to protect our data (except for unique indexes). One underwater rock to be aware of: some RDBMS systems (e.g. Oracle) will automatically create an index on foreign key creation and we don’t have to worry about that. Others (e.g. MS SQL Server) will not and we have to add indexes ourselves.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>A well-thought design can save us many hours of coding, testing, and troubleshooting. Writing queries and reports against a well-designed database is a pleasure. Publishing and migrating that data to a new system is also very easy.</p>



<p>Opinions presented in this article are the result of many years dealing with various database systems. Some may be suitable for your case and some even contrary. So don’t take them for granted.</p>



<p>Happy coding!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, I want to make it clear that I’m not accusing the compositor of true evil, which I define roughly as deliberately causing suffering. There’s unfortunately too much of that in the world. I mean it in the more metaphorical sense that it causes serious problems and forces other parts of the system to be more complex to work around its limitations.</p>

<p>I will also outline a better design that might be implemented in the future, as well as some possibilities for how applications can deal with the current situation. But first, to understand better how we got into this mess, we’ll look a bit into the past.</p>

<h2 id="8-bit-systems-video-processing-engines">8-bit systems: video processing engines</h2>

<p>Early home computers and video games had 8-bit CPUs and only a few kilobytes of RAM. Some computers, like the Apple II, allocated some of the RAM as a frame buffer and used the CPU to fill it, but this approach is quite limiting. So designers of most other systems of the time got creative - in particular, they augmented the CPU with a graphics processing engine. This engine did a fair amount of processing during <em>scanout,</em> in other words on the fly as the system generated a video signal.</p>

<p>The details of these early graphics processors varied, but most were a combination of four basic operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indirect lookup of tile images (also useful for text).</li>
  <li>Expansion of low bit depth pixels into more colors through a palette.</li>
  <li>Control over the offset in video memory to read (for scrolling effects).</li>
  <li>Overlay of small graphic elements (sprites).</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of even a modest CPU and one of these video processing engines led to a creative explosion of games, with a unique aesthetic formed from the primitives provided by the video chip: colorful scrolling backgrounds formed from tiles, with the player avatar and other characters overlaid, also moving dynamically. One of the most popular (and best documented) such chips is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">C64 VIC-II</a>, and of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Processing_Unit">NES PPU</a> is another classic example. People still create software for these beloved systems, learning from tutorials such as <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/22/when-visibility-matters">VIC-II for beginners</a>.</p>

<p>While the constraints of the hardware served as artistic inspiration for a diverse and impressive corpus of games, they also limited the kind of visual expression that was possible. For example, any attempt at 3D was primitive at best (though there were driving games that did impressive attempts, using the scrolling and color palette mechanisms to simulate a moving roadway).</p>

<p>The most ambitious games and demos agressively poked at the hardware, “racing the beam” to dynamically manipulate the registers in the video chip, unlocking more colors and other graphical effects that no doubt were not even anticipated by the original designers of the hardware.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning as an extreme example is the Atari 2600, which had all of 20 bits (that’s right, two and a half bytes) devoted to what might be considered a frame buffer. Basically all graphical effects needed to be implemented by racing the beam. Fortunately, the programmer could make use of the deterministic cycle counts for instructions on the 6502 microprocessor, so that writes to the video registers would happen with timing considerably finer than one scan line. Even so, it requires some <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67b32347d5ca97d21a4c9e69a3b1a1a3">fairly tricky code</a> to even display the <a href="https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.6.0/embed.html?p=vcs&amp;r=TFpHAAAQAAAAAR1Ufls8AQMFDBJ42KIAiqjKmkjQ%2B6kOhQKFAErQ%2Ba2EAgyGCanGhQaFB6kAhQipGIUKDI%2BiJYUCytD7hgGgB4YNhg6GD4UCBADqEg%2BFEIURhQKI0PugEKIMeQ2FDrki8YUPuVXxhRu5ZfGFBLkz8YUNuUTxhQ4MFww%2BytDYuQAMSxEMCwyk6uoFDhyI0LKgOAUERgzH%2B6kChQGpIYUCjZYCBQOXTAvwABIeEgb8rFz4wPwE9BIDBPwAAPCgUPAw8ADwEgMA8AAAwMDAgADAQBIFwAUJNGwAqAULRDcSIRIR%2FxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh4SHBIIAPAA8A%3D%3D">Recurse Center logo</a> in all three colors.</p>

<p>An important aspect of all these systems, even those as underpowered as the Atari 2600, is that latency was <em>very</em> low. A well coded game might process the inputs during the vertical blanking interval, updating scroll and sprite coordinates (just a few register pokes), so they apply to the next frame being scanned out - latency under 16ms. Similar math applies to the latency of typing, which is why the Apple IIe <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">scores so well</a> on latency tests compared to modern computers.</p>

<h2 id="16-and-32-bit-home-computers-cpu--framebuffer">16 and 32 bit home computers: CPU + framebuffer</h2>

<p>Through the late 80s, while arcade games continued to evolve their graphics hardware, the IBM PC became ascendant as a home computer. From its roots as a “business” computer, its CPU performance and RAM grew dramatically, but video output was generally a framebuffer with almost none of the capabilities listed above. Even so, display resolutions and bit depths improved (VGA was 640x480 with 16 colors per pixel). A reasonably powerful CPU, especially in the hands of an expert coder, can produce rather impressive graphics. An example is Microsoft Flight Simulator, which had 3D graphics, fully drawn in software.</p>

<p>Another landmark release was the original Doom, released in 1993, which also was entirely software-rendered graphics, complete with lighting and textures.</p>

<p>The rendering of UI and 2D graphics continued to evolve during this time as well, with proportional spaced fonts becoming the standard, and <a href="http://www.truetype-typography.com/ttalias.htm">antialiased font rendering</a> slowly becoming standard as well during the 90s. (Likely the <a href="https://telcontar.net/Misc/GUI/RISCOS/#text">Acorn Archimedes</a> was the first to ship with antialiased text rendering, around 1992)</p>

<h2 id="multiple-windows-and-process-separation">Multiple windows and process separation</h2>

<p>A trend at the same time was the ability to run multiple applications, each with their own window. While the idea had been around for a while, it burst on to the scene with the Macintosh, and the rest of the world caught up shortly after.</p>

<p>Early implementations did <em>not</em> have “preemptive multitasking,” or what we would call process separation. Applications, even when running in windowed mode, wrote directly into the framebuffer. The platform basically provided a library for applications to keep track of visible regions, so they wouldn’t paint in regions where the window was occluded. Related, when an occluding window went away, the system would notify the application it needed to repaint (WM_PAINT on Windows), and, because computers were slow and this took a while, the “damage region” was visible for a bit (this is explained and animated in Jasper St. Pierre’s <a href="https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/x-basics.html">X Window System Basics</a> article).</p>

<p>In this early version of windowing GUI, latency wasn’t seriously affected. Some things were slower because resolution and bit depth was going up, and of course text needed to be rendered into bitmaps (more computationally expensive with antialiasing), but a well-written application could still be quite responsive.</p>

<p>However, running without process separation was a serious problem, if for no other reason than the fact that a misbehaving application could corrupt the entire system; consumer desktop systems were seriously behind the Unix/X11 ecosystem in this regard. System crashes were extremely common in the days of pre-X Mac OS, and pre-NT Windows (though Windows 95 had a limited form of process separation in that the display server bounded the window’s drawing area). Certainly in the Unix tradition, applications would run in their own process, with some kind of client-server protocol to combine the presentation of the multiple applications together. The X System (aka X11) came to dominate in Unix, but before that there were many other proposals, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">NeWS</a>. Also common to the Unix tradition, these would commonly run across a network.</p>

<h2 id="apples-aqua-compositor">Apple’s Aqua compositor</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.0">OS X</a> (now macOS) first shipped in 2001, it was visually striking in a number of ways. Notably for this discussion, the contents of windows were blended with full alpha transparency and soft shadows. At the heart of this was a <em>compositor.</em> Applications did not draw directly to the screen, but to off-screen buffers which were then composited using a special process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Compositor">Quartz Compositor</a>.</p>

<p>In the first version, all the drawing and compositing was done in software. Since machines at the time weren’t particularly powerful, performance was bad. According to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/2/">retrospective review</a>, “in its initial incarnation, Aqua was unbearably slow and a huge resource hog.”</p>

<p>Even so, things improved. By 10.2 (Jaguar) in August 2002, Quartz Extreme did the compositing in the GPU, finally making performance comparable to pre-compositor designs.</p>

<p>While there have been changes (discussed in some detail below), Quartz Compositor is fundamentally the modern compositor design used today. Microsoft Vista adopted a similar design with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview">DWM</a>, first in Vista, and made non-optional by Windows 8. Also, while I consider Aqua the first real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositor</a> in the modern sense, there were important predecessors, notably the Amiga. Jasper St. Pierre points out that Windows 2000 had a limited compositor, known as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-features#layered-windows">“layered windows”</a>, where certain windows could be redirected offscreen.</p>

<h2 id="doing-more-in-the-compositor">Doing more in the compositor</h2>

<p>Using the GPU to just bitblt window contents is using a tiny fraction of its capabilities. In the compositing process, it could be fading in and out alpha transparency, sliding subwindows around, and applying other effects without costing much at all in performance (the GPU is already reading all the pixels from the offscreen buffers and writing to the display surface). The only trick is exposing these capabilities to the application.</p>

<p>On the Apple side, this was driven by iOS and its heavy reliance on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore">Core Animation</a>. The idea is that “layers” can be drawn using relatively slow software rendering, then scrolling and many other effects can be done smoothly at 60fps by compositing these layers in the GPU.</p>

<p>Core Animation was also made available in Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). The corresponding Windows version was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directcomp/directcomposition-portal">DirectComposition</a>, introduced in Windows 8 and a core feature of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)">Metro</a> design language (which was not very popular at the time).</p>

<p>These features have made the compositor more integral to modern GUI software, though there is a range of how aggressively applications make use of compositor feature.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-latency-come-from">Where does the latency come from?</h2>

<p>I talk a lot about latency, but let’s understand why introducing the compositor fundamentally adds so much of it. Some of this is also discussed in the blog post <a href="http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/dwm_latency.html">Desktop compositing latency is real and it annoys me</a> (also see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15747650">HN discussion</a>).</p>

<p>The amount of time needed to render a frame of content varies. If the goal is smooth 60fps (as I think it should be!) then …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 40,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 40,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNG</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;This was meant to be a high-level introduction into this topic.

        <p><span>At Uber, real-time analytics allow us to attain business insights and operational efficiency, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to improve experiences on the Uber platform. For example, our operations team relies on data to monitor the market health and spot potential issues on our platform; software powered by machine learning models leverages data to predict rider supply and driver demand; and data scientists use data to improve machine learning models for better forecasting. </span></p>
<p><span>In the past, we have utilized many third-party database solutions for real-time analytics, but none were able to simultaneously address all of our functional, scalability, performance, cost, and operational requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>Released in November 2018, AresDB is an open source, real-time analytics engine that leverages an unconventional power source, graphics processing units (GPUs), to enable our analytics to grow at scale. An emerging tool for real-time analytics, GPU technology has advanced significantly over the years, making it a perfect fit for real-time computation and data processing in parallel. </span></p>
<p><span>In the following sections, we describe the design of AresDB and how this powerful solution for real-time analytics has allowed us to more performatively and efficiently unify, simplify, and improve Uber’s real-time analytics database solutions. After reading this article, we hope you try out AresDB for your own projects and find the tool useful your own analytics needs, too! </span></p>
<h3>Real-time analytics applications at Uber</h3>
<p><span>Data analytics are crucial to the success of Uber’s business. Among other functions, these analytics are used to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Build </span><b>dashboards</b><span> to monitor our business metrics</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>automated decisions</b><span> (such as </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/drive/partner-app/how-surge-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>trip pricing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/advanced-technologies-detecting-preventing-fraud-uber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>fraud detection</span></a><span>) based on aggregated metrics that we collect</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>ad hoc queries</b><span> to diagnose and troubleshoot business operations issues</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We can summarize these functions into categories with different requirements as follows:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Dashboards</b></td>
<td><b>Decision Systems</b></td>
<td><b>Ad hoc Queries</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Pattern</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Arbitrary </span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query QPS</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Latency</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Dataset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>All data</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span>Dashboards and decision systems leverage real-time analytical systems to make similar queries over relatively small, yet highly valuable, subsets of data (with maximum data freshness) at high QPS and low latency.</span></p>
<h4>The need for another analytical engine</h4>
<p><span>The most common problem that real-time analytics solves at Uber is how to compute time series aggregates, calculations that give us insight into the user experience so we can improve our services accordingly. With these computations, we can request metrics by specific dimensions (such as day, hour, city ID, and trip status) over a time range on arbitrarily filtered (or sometimes joined) data. Over the years, Uber has deployed multiple solutions to solve this problem in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the third-party solutions we’ve used for solving this type of problem include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Apache Pinot</b></a><span>, an open source distributed analytical database written in Java, can be leveraged for large-scale data analytics. Pinot employs a lambda architecture internally to query batch and real-time data in columnar storage, uses inverted bitmap index for filtering, and relies on star-tree for aggregate result caching. However, it does not support key-based deduplication, upsert, joins, and advanced query features such as geo-spatial-filtering. In addition, being a JVM-based database, query execution on Pinot runs at a higher cost in terms of memory usage.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Elasticsearch</b></a><span> is used at Uber for a variety of streaming analytics needs. It was built on Apache </span><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Lucene</span></a><span> for full-text keyword search that stores documents and inverted index. It has been widely adopted and extended to also support aggregates. The inverted index enables filtering, yet it is not optimized for time range-based storage and filtering. It stores records as JSON documents, imposing additional storage and query access overhead. Like Pinot, Elasticsearch is a JVM-based database, and as such, does not support joins and its query execution runs at a higher memory cost. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While these technologies have strengths of their own, they lacked crucial functionalities for our use case. We needed a unified, simplified, and optimized solution, and thought outside-of-the-box (or rather, inside the GPU) to reach a solution.</span></p>
<h3>Leveraging GPUs for real-time analytics</h3>
<p><span>To render realistic views of images at a high frame rate, GPUs process a massive amount of geometries and pixels in parallel at high speed. While the clock-rate increase for processing units has plateaued over the past few years, the number of transistors on a chip has only increased per </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Moore’s law</span></a><span>. As a result, GPU computation speeds, measured in Gigaflops per second (GFLOP/s), are rapidly increasing. Figure 1, below, depicts the theoretical GFLOP/s trend comparing NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs over the years:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5345"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="314" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png 1999w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-300x157.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-768x402.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1024x536.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-696x365.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1068x559.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-802x420.png 802w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1920x1006.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5345">Figure 1: Comparison of CPU and GPU single precision floating point performance through the years.

<p><span>When designing our real-time analytics querying engine, integrating GPU processing was a natural fit. At Uber, the typical real-time analytical query processes a few days of data with millions to billions of records and then filters and aggregates them in a short amount of time. This computation task fits perfectly into the parallel processing model of general purpose GPUs because they:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Process data in parallel very quickly. </span></li>
<li><span>Deliver greater computation throughput (GFLOPS/s), making them a good fit for heavy computation tasks (per unit data) that can be parallelized. </span></li>
<li><span>Offer greater compute-to-storage (ALU to GPU global memory) data access throughput (not latency) compared to central processing units (CPUs), making them ideal for processing I/O (memory)-bound parallel tasks that require a massive amount of data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Once we settled on using a GPU-based analytical database, we assessed a few existing analytics solutions that leveraged GPUs for our needs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kinetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Kinetica</b></a><span>, a GPU-based analytics engine, was initially marketed towards U.S. military and intelligence applications in 2009. While it demonstrates the great potential of GPU technology in analytics, we found many key features missing</span> <span>for our use case, including </span><span>schema alteration, partial insertion or updates, data compression, column-level memory/disk retention configuration, and join by geospatial relationships.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.omnisci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>OmniSci</b></a><span>, an open source, SQL-based query engine, seemed like a promising option, but as we evaluated the product, we realized that it did not have critical</span><span> features for Uber’s use case, such as deduplication. While </span><span>OminiSci</span> <span>open sourced their project in 2017, after some analysis of their C++-based solution, we concluded that neither contributing back nor forking their codebase was viable.</span></li>
<li><span>GPU-based real-time analytics engines, including </span><a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/gpuqp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUQP</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://cogadb.dfki.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>CoGaDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p817-yuan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p709-heimel.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ocelot</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1374-he.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OmniDB</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://github.com/bakks/virginian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Virginian</span></a><span>, are frequently used by academic institutions. However, given their academic purpose, these solutions focus on developing algorithms and designing proof of concepts as opposed to handling real-world production scenarios. For this reason, we discounted them for our scope and scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, </span><span>these engines</span><span> demonstrate the great advantage and potential of data processing using GPU technology, and they inspired us to build our own GPU-based, real-time analytics solution tailored to Uber’s needs. With these concepts in mind, we built and open sourced AresDB.</span></p>
<h3>AresDB architecture overview</h3>
<p><span>At a high level, AresDB stores most of its data in host memory (RAM that is connected to CPUs), handling data ingestion using CPUs and data recovery via disks. At query time, AresDB transfers data from host memory to GPU memory for parallel processing on GPU. As shown in Figure 2, below, AresDB consists of a memory store, a meta datastore, and a disk store:</span></p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p><span>Unlike most </span><span>relational database management systems (</span><span>RDBMSs), there is no database or schema scope in AresDB. All tables belong to the same scope in the same AresDB cluster/instance, enabling users to refer to them directly. Users store their data as fact tables and dimension tables.</span></p>
<h5>Fact table</h5>
<p><span>A fact table stores an infinite stream of time series events. Users use a fact table to store events/facts that are happening in real time, and each event is associated with an event time, with the table often queried by the event time. An example of the type of information stored by fact tables are trips, where each trip is an event and the trip request time is often designated as the event time. In case an event has multiple timestamps associated with it, only one timestamp is designated as the time of the event displayed in the fact table.</span></p>
<h5>Dimension table</h5>
<p><span>A dimension table stores current properties for entities (including cities, clients, and drivers). For example, users can store city information, such as city name, time zone, and country, in a dimension table. Compared to fact tables, which grow infinitely over time, dimension tables are always bounded by size (e.g., for Uber, the cities table is bounded by the actual number of cities in the world). Dimension tables do not need a special time column.</span></p>
<h4>Data types</h4>

<p>It’s a common narrative in tech to design products with the assumption that users are stupid and lazy. I think that is both disrespectful and wrong.</p>



<p>The idea is rooted in a lot of research around product usability, but it has been bastardized. Thing of it as a perversion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Don’t Make Me Think</a> thesis.</p>



<p><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, the seminal web usability book by Steve Krug, tells us that products should be as simple as possible for users to use. Products shouldn’t be self-explanatory (ie understandable given a set of instructions), they should be self-evident (ie so obvious that they can be used <em>without</em> having to read instructions). A good door has a push/pull sign to make it self-explanatory, but it still requires you to read and think. An even better door wouldn’t even need that label at all—you know what to do instinctively.</p>



<p>But somehow, we’ve perverted that idea. Users are lazy, even stupid, we say. They just want to flick their fingers down an infinite feed, letting their eyes wander from item to item.</p>



<p>But in <em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, Krug never refers to users in a derogatory way. He tells us how good products should work, and why basic psychology supports that. People want to reduce cognitive friction as much as possible. People don’t like unneeded cognitive friction. People skim quickly and “muddle through” products. And, most of all, people won’t undertake effort unless they believe it’s worth the cost. These are all facts backed by usability research and psychology.</p>



<p>In other words, he tells us <em>what</em> good products should look like, and <em>how</em> people use them. But he doesn’t pass judgment on users. That’s up to us.</p>



<p>And so naturally, we apply our view of the world, our values. If you view your users with contempt, then the reason behind why people don’t like complicated products is because they are stupid and lazy. If, on the other hand, you <em>respect</em> your users, you might view things differently.</p>



<p>Firstly, our brains have been wired, through millions of years of evolution, to conserve effort and time. That’s actually not being lazy, it’s being smart and protective of one of our most valuable assets. Naturally, we don’t undertake an activity unless we believe it’s worth the cost (though there are ways to trick us, more on that later). And if it takes effort to even figure out how much effort an activity will require, we’ll avoid that activity altogether. That’s the functional, practical piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>Secondly, we are a complex bundle of emotions. Even if we’re smart, we don’t like <em>feeling</em> stupid. And complex, difficult things makes us feel stupid. They strike at our very identity and self-worth. So we try to avoid them like we avoid that hard topic we were never good at in school. <em>That</em> part is the emotional piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>So what explains the rise of products like Facebook, which have gotten a large part of humanity mindlessly scrolling through feeds of what can most easily be described as garbage content? Well, we humans aren’t perfect. If you’ve got billions of dollars, some of the brightest minds, and a lot of data at your disposal, you can get a lot of people to do what you want. If you treat users as stupid and lazy, you can turn them into stupid and lazy people in the context of your product… but that’s a subject for another post.</p>



<p>So here’s how I think about people and product design.</p>



<p>Firstly, products should definitely be as simple as possible. Because I <em>respect </em>users’ time, not because I look down on their intelligence.</p>



<p>Second, have a theory of how people behave. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory">Self-determination Theory</a>, which states that people value autonomy, relatedness, and competence. And I love building product that help people improve all those three dimensions.</p>



<p>Three, have a set of principles for your product. For instance, of the three axes of self-determination, I particularly care about autonomy (control). And I’ve found that good products, ones that respect their users, <em>give them more control</em>. Bad products <em>take away control</em>. Simplicity can fulfill both of those purposes. It can give people control by abstracting away things they don’t care about and helping them focus. Or it can take away control by only letting users do things the product’s designers want them to do. So that’s one of my principles: give people control. Help them do things <em>they </em>want to do, not things <em>you</em> want them to do.</p>



<p>Let’s respect our users. Technology can bring out the best or worst in us, both individually and collectively. Let’s focus on the best.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The above article is what I wrote, in its half-formed state on a Sunday morning. It looks like it’s blowing up on HackerNews, so I wanted to just add a few points.</p>



<ul><li>I know I can come across as idealistic. I’ve even gotten that as feedback on a formal performance review (but also, I’ve gotten that I’m cynical, so *shrug*). I’m not saying people can’t be lazy, entitled, or stupid. We can. We have that <em>capacity</em>. But we have the <em>capacity</em> for so much more than that. And we should focus our tools, our technology, on our best capacities.</li><li>If Self-determination Theory resonates with you, I’d urge you to think about how it applies to building teams or even parenting. Your employees and colleagues, or your children and family members, have all the human capacities as well (though obviously, for children, they are still under development). Since I’m much more experienced at managing teams (dozen years) than being a parent (two years), I’ll just say that companies that view employees as lazy and incompetent are a scourge. If you can afford to avoid working at companies like that, try your best. And if you’re tasked with building companies or teams, you get to choose. You still need rules, hierarchies, and processes, but if you give people autonomy and relatedness/purpose, and trust their competence, I hope you’ll be pleasantly surprised. If you treat employees as stupid and lazy, they will be.</li><li>On simplicity vs. control/flexibility: I’m a big fan of the Alan Kay quote that “<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible</a>.” I think great products find a way of achieving both those objectives. You keep things simple, but don’t throw out the baby with the bath-water. Like the word processor. 99% of the time, you just want to type some text, so you get a cursor and WYSIWIG typing. But sometimes, you want to style, you want to indent, you want to program macros. We apply this principle often at <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> (personal finance platform that I’m working on) and so far have found it to be quite successful.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post covers why I believe local and national governments should
adopt and invest in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS).</p>

<p>This has been in the news recently due to the city of Munich renewing 
it’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-not-windows-why-munich-is-shifting-back-from-microsoft-to-open-source-again/">LiMux Linux distribution</a>
thanks to an agreement between the local SDP and Green politicians, and
the efforts of the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money, Public Code</a> campaign.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>

<h2 id="limux">LiMux</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux">LiMux</a> is a project by the German city of Munich to migrate its desktop
infrastructure to FOSS solutions, specifically to the LiMux Linux
distribution (based on Ubuntu) and LibreOffice (initially to OpenOffice). The project was started in 2004, and
migration began in 2006.</p>

<p>By the end of 2013, 15,000 desktops had been migrated successfully.
However, in September 2016 <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-germany-moves-into-a-new-headquarters/">Microsoft announced the opening of a new headquarters in Munich</a>, and then
in 2017 the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10/">city council decided to switch back to Microsoft Windows and Office</a>.
The timing of this decision led to many accusations of effective
bribery, using the potential office opening to pressure the council in to using
Microsoft products (note that there is no evidence of a kick-back scheme
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-pay-25m-to-doj-and-sec-in-hungary-bribery-case/">like practiced by Microsoft Hungary</a>).</p>

<p>Fortunately <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200506-01.en.html">this decision has now been reversed</a>, and LiMux 
development and roll-out will continue.</p>

<h2 id="other-cities">Other cities</h2>

<p>Munich is not the only city choosing Free Software solutions, many
others are beginning to see the potential benefits too. In Catalonia,
Barcelona’s <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/es/transformacion-digital/tecnologia-para-un-gobierno-mejor/software-libre">Digital Transformation programme supports Free Software</a>.
From first-hand experience this means that the government transport /
road organisation use LibreOffice for all documents - so local driving
schools, etc. do not need a copy of Microsoft Office to handle the
necessary digital paperwork.</p>

<p>In Valencia, <a href="https://www.muylinux.com/2013/08/22/generalitat-valenciana-libreoffice/">the local government migrated its administration and
schools to LibreOffice</a>
saving 1.5 million euros per year, and saving students and other
end-users from having to purchase their own copies of Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>However, it is not always straightforward. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/737818/">Munich faced a lot of push-back in some areas</a>, and the <a href="https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/politica/colau-gasta-4-5-millones-en-microsoft-mientras-promete-software-libre_32165_102.html">city of Barcelona still pays almost 5 million
euros</a>
in license costs to Microsoft.</p>

<p>The main issue here is not so much the direct cost to the city itself
(which is substantial, but not critical compared to other costs -
especially since any migration will incur a significant short-term
cost), but more that the cost must be paid over and over again by all
users separately. Barcelona continues to pay millions to Microsoft every
year, but so will other cities in Spain and across Europe, and then so will all
users of those services that may have to use a copy of Microsoft Office for
compatibility reasons (i.e. students and small businesses).</p>

<p>The same cost is paid over and over again to a foreign company that will
not hire local developers or invest in the local economy, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft#Vendor_lock-in">uses vendor lock-in</a>
to eventually control all of the critical infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-foss">Benefits of FOSS</h2>

<p>The most commonly cited benefit of Free Software is certainly the cost
savings vs. proprietary licensing. Whilst this can be a benefit
in some circumstances, I think it overlooks many greater far-reaching
benefits, and may not actually manifest itself in the short-term due to
the additional costs of the actual migration (i.e. costs of deployment
and training).</p>

<h3 id="shared-investment">Shared investment</h3>

<p>The main benefit of using FOSS solutions is that any investment in the
development and improvement of the software also benefits all other
users of the software.</p>

<p>That is, whilst the city of Munich might need <a href="https://github.com/WollMux/WollMux">some improvements in
handling templates</a>, other cities
might need other improvements - however they can all benefit from
each others’ investment, with no need to pay again just to keep a license.</p>

<p>This helps to build up a commonwealth of high-quality, well-maintained
software which anyone can use. There is no central, unique
owner of the projects (any project could be forked if necessary), so
there is no company that can demand payments just to allow you to keep using the
existing software.</p>

<p>Any investment in development made is truly an investment, leading directly
to project improvements, rather than just money sent to a foreign
company whilst the customers have no ownership of the actual product,
allowing the company to charge even more in the future just for the
right to keep using it (usually this is done by giving discounts for the
early migration which then result in higher prices later once the
customer is locked in).</p>

<p>Note that this initial investment might be higher than the current costs
of existing proprietary software licensing, when considering the
migration and training costs and possible development costs. However,
unlike those licensing costs it is a one-time cost, and the customer
retains some ownership over the resulting product (i.e. there is not a
license that can be revoked).</p>

<h3 id="freedom-for-development">Freedom for development</h3>

<p>There is also more freedom in the development process. The fact that the
products aren’t owned by a company means that contributions can be made
by anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Users of the software (such as the cities mentioned above) could fund
<a href="https://github.com/hng/tech-coops">local co-operatives of developers</a> to add desired features and maintain
the projects, instead of being forced to fund a foreign corporation with
no local investment.</p>

<p>In the long-term this might also help to break up some of the monopolistic
Big Tech companies, and result in a freer society and business
environment for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="national-security">National security</h3>

<p>In Europe especially, the current dependence on proprietary software
often means a dependence on foreign corporations which operate in
co-operation with their country’s intelligence service. As revealed by
Edward Snowden, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">Microsoft provided backdoor access to encrypted messages</a> to
the NSA, CIA and FBI as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM programme</a>.</p>

<p>It is indefensible that such a company can run the critical infrastructure
of the vast majority of local and central government administrations, as
well as personal computers. Especially when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/nsa-tapped-german-chancellery-decades-wikileaks-claims-merkel">NSA has been proven to
intercept communications of supposedly allied nations</a>.</p>

<p>With FOSS software there is no central company to be pressured by
intelligence services or build in backdoors. All of the code can be
scrutinised by developers and users. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus’s Law</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same concept applies to introducing backdoors to access private data. It
might be possible to pressure or bribe one company to do so, but it
isn’t possible to do the same to tens of thousands of independent users and
developers.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture">Bigger picture</h2>

<p>The effects of co-ordinated FOSS adoption are much more far-reaching and
positive than solely saving the costs of current software licenses.</p>

<p>The adoption of FOSS and investment by many governments (at all levels)
would help to create a commonwealth of quality Free Software for all
citizens and government bodies to benefit from.</p>

<p>It would also allow development of these projects to be done from
anywhere, allowing users to fund local developers or co-operatives. This
would help to break up the massive, monopolistic Big Tech companies, and
could also be used as a way of bringing investment and jobs to parts of
the country/region that require it.</p>

<p>This would also be highly beneficial to developers, as they would have
more control over their own work (as they are not tied to the few
employers that own these popular products), and would also likely be
able to negotiate a larger portion of the compensation directly since
there would not be the overhead of salespeople and lawyers, etc. present in
current large software companies.</p>

<p>All Free Software users would benefit from the greater usage and
investment - GNU/Linux users could expect better hardware support for
example, as it becomes more commonplace.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h2>

<p>Whilst the benefits of adopting FOSS are clear, the cases in Munich and
Hungary show that it will not be an easy path to greater adoption. We
cannot just rely on central government eventually carry out the adoption
as the few representatives are easily pressured by the beneficiaries of
the status quo, and are serving a much larger political platform.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the solution lies in applying “Linus’s Law” to
politics itself. It is no coincidence that the successes in FOSS
adoption so far have been concentrated in local government - in specific
city councils and regional administrations, because it is easier for
engaged groups of citizens to have a direct effect in local government.</p>

<p>At a national level, it might be possible for a large software company
to pressure a few political leaders and policy makers, however, it is
much harder to do the same to a whole board of a dozen or more local
councillors (especially across the multitude of different counties and
regional administrations). There is “safety in numbers” as it becomes
unfeasible to pressure and manipulate large groups of
politically-engaged citizens.</p>

<p>It it is the responsibility of every citizen in a democratic society not
only to inform themselves and vote in national elections, but also to really partake in the
political system: by joining a political party, taking part in local and
regional elections, and ensuring that the democratic standards are
upheld both inside the party and in political institutions.</p>

<p>This should have support from across the political spectrum, as
guaranteeing the security and privacy of citizens’ data whilst also
cutting out the middlemen of massive foreign corporations, shouldn’t be
a controversial policy.</p>

<p>Efforts in local politics have already proven successful, such as the
LiMux project and others mentioned previously. So if you agree with the
points raised here I hope you will join whichever local political party
you agree most with, and help to bring about FOSS adoption by your
government.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Greater FOSS adoption by our governments benefits the administrations
themselves by being free …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>There is a common view that extracting text from a PDF document should not be too difficult. After all, the text is right there in front of our eyes and humans consume PDF content all the time with great success. Why would it be difficult to automatically extract the text data? </p><p>Turns out, much how <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">working with human names is difficult</a> due to numerous edge cases and incorrect assumptions, working with PDFs is difficult due to the extreme flexibility given by the PDF format.</p><p>The main problem is that PDF was never really designed as a data input format, but rather, it was designed as an output format giving fine grained control over the resulting document.</p><p>At its core, the PDF format consists of a stream of instructions describing how to draw on a page. In particular, text data isn’t stored as paragraphs - or even words - but as characters which are painted at certain locations on the page. As a result, most of the content semantics are lost when a text or word document is converted to PDF - all the implied text structure is converted into an almost amorphous soup of characters floating on pages.</p><p>As part of building <a href="https://www.filingdb.com/">FilingDB</a>, we’ve extracted text data from tens of thousands of PDF documents. In the process, we have seen how every single assumption we had about how PDF files are structured was proven incorrect. Our mission was particularly difficult as we had to process PDF documents coming from a variety of sources, with wildly different styling, typesetting and presentation choices.</p><p>The list below documents some of the ways PDF files have made it difficult (or even impossible) to extract text contents.</p><h2>PDF read protection</h2><p>You may have come across PDF files which refuse to let you copy their text content. For example, here is what SumatraPDF shows when attempting to copy text from a copy-protected document.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tCFgGsFAVfhZQqJx.png" alt="copy denied.png"></p><p>Interestingly, the text is already visible, yet the PDF viewer is refusing to populate the clipboard with the highlighted text.</p><p>The way this is implemented is by having several “access permissions” flags, one of which controls whether copying content is allowed. It’s important to keep in mind that this restriction is not enforced by the PDF file - the actual PDF contents are unaffected and it is up to the pdf renderer to honour this flag.</p><p>Needless to say, this offers no real protection against extracting the text out of the PDF, as any reasonably sophisticated PDF handling library will allow the user to either toggle the flags or ignore them.</p><h2>Off-page characters</h2><p>It is not uncommon for PDF files to contain more textual data than is actually displayed on the page. Take this page from the 2010 Nestle annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/rWwxfWHHBcjvZQul.png" alt="Nestle hidden text.png"></p><p>There is more text associated with this page than meets the eye. In particular, the following can be found in the content data associated with this page:</p><blockquote>“KitKat celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010 but remains young and in touch with trends, having over 2.5 million Facebook fans. It is sold in over 70 countries and enjoys good growth in the developed world and emerging markets, such as the Middle East, India and Russia. Japan is its second biggest market.”</blockquote><p>This text is actually positioned outside the page’s bounding box, so it is not displayed by most PDF viewers, but the data is there and will appear when programmatically extracting the text.</p><p>This occasionally happens due to last minute decisions to remove or replace text during the type setting process.</p><h2>Small / invisible characters on page</h2><p>PDFs occasionally introduce very small or hidden text on the page. For example, here is a page from the Nestle 2012 annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kqduhxcugDRKTbDC.png" alt="hidden characters.png"></p><p>The page contains small white text on white background with the following contents:</p><blockquote>​“Wyeth Nutrition logo Identity Guidance to markets</blockquote><blockquote>Vevey Octobre 2012 RCC/CI&amp;D”</blockquote><p>This is sometimes done for the benefit of accessibility, similar to how the alt attribute is used in HTML.</p><h2>​Too many spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs include extra spaces between letters in a word. This is most likely done for kerning purposes. (“Kerning” is the process of adjusting distances between characters during the type setting process)</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: the 2013 Hikma Pharma annual report contains the following text:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LNAUhbShXUkPbOhc.png" alt="an_excellent.PNG"></p><p>Copying the text gives:</p><blockquote>“ch a i r m a n ' s s tat em en t”</blockquote><p>Reconstructing the original text is a difficult problem to solve generally. Our most successful approach has been applying OCR techniques.</p><h2>Not enough spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs do not contain spaces or replace them with a different character.</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: The following extract from the 2017 SEB annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/byRVQrWFscgwqUbM.png" alt="global trends.PNG"></p><p>The extracted text shows:</p><blockquote>“Tenyearsafterthefinancialcrisisstarted”</blockquote><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: The 2013 Eurobank annual report shows the following</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/cNjRRWVALUGfSnRl.png" alt="eurobank.PNG"></p><p>Extracting the text gives:</p><blockquote>“On_April_7,_2013,_the_competent_authorities”</blockquote><p>Again, our most successful solution was to run OCR on these pages.</p><h2>Embedded fonts</h2><p>PDF font handling is complex to say the least. To understand how PDF files store text data we must first know about glyphs, glyph names, fonts.</p><ul><li>A glyph is a set of instructions describing how to draw a symbol or character.</li><li>A glyph name is the name associated with that glyph. For example “trademark” for the “™” glyph and “a” for the “a” glyph.</li><li>Fonts are lists of glyphs with associated glyph names. For example, most fonts have a glyph that most humans would recognize as the letter “a”, with different fonts showing various ways of drawing that letter.</li></ul><p>In a PDF, the characters are stored as numbers, called “codepoints”. To decide what to draw on the screen, a renderer has to go:</p><p><code>codepoint -&gt; glyph name -&gt; glyph</code></p><p>For example, a PDF document can contain codepoint 116, which it maps into the glyph name “<code>t</code>” which, in turn, maps into the glyph describing how to draw “<code>t</code>” on the screen.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/boPNiRoKrNIlOHHD.png" alt="unicode glyphs.png"></p><p>Now, most PDF files use a standard codepoint encoding. A codepoint encoding is a set of rules that assign meaning to the codepoints themselves. For example:</p><ul><li>ASCII and Unicode both use codepoint 116 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”.</li><li>Unicode maps codepoint 9786 to “<code>white smiley face</code>”, rendered as ☺, whereas ASCII is not defined at that codepoint. </li></ul><p>However, PDF documents occasionally use their own custom encoding together with custom fonts. It might seem strange, but a document can use codepoint 1 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”. It will map codepoint 1 into the glyph name “<code>c1</code>”, which will map into a glyph describing how to draw the letter “<code>t</code>”.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/oLGIEmjOegjUtsiQ.png" alt="custom glyphs.png"></p><p>While for a human the end result looks the same, a machine will get confused by the codepoints it is seeing. If the codepoints do not follow a standard encoding, then it is virtually impossible to programmatically know what codepoints 1, 2 and 3 represent.</p><p>Why would a PDF document contain nonstandard fonts and encodings?</p><ul><li>One reason is to make text extraction more difficult.</li><li>Another is the use of subfonts. Most fonts contain glyphs for a very large number of codepoints and a pdf might only use a subset of these. To save space, a PDF creator can strip away all unneeded glyphs and create a compact subfont which will most likely use a non-standard encoding.</li></ul><p>One workaround is to extract the font glyphs from the document, run them through OCR software and build the map from font glyph to unicode. This then lets you translate from the font-specific encoding to the unicode encoding e.g: codepoint 1 is mapped to name “<code>c1</code>” which, based on looking at the glyph, should be a “<code>t</code>”, which is unicode codepoint 116.</p><p>The encoding map that you’ve just generated, the one going from 1 to 116, is called a ToUnicode map in the PDF standard. PDF documents can provide their own ToUnicode map, but it’s optional and many do not.</p><h2>Word and paragraph detection</h2><p>Reconstructing paragraphs and even words from the amorphous character soup of PDF files is a difficult task.</p><p>The PDF document provides a list of characters on a page and it is up to the consumer to identify words and paragraphs. Humans are naturally effective at doing this as reading is a widespread skill.</p><p>The common approach is to have a grouping or clustering algorithm which compares letter sizes, positions and alignments in order to determine what is a word/paragraph.</p><p>Naive implementations can easily have complexity larger than O(n²), resulting in long processing times on busy pages.</p><h2>Text and paragraph order</h2><p>Deciding on text and paragraph order is difficult on two levels.</p><p>First, sometimes there is no correct answer. While documents with conventional, single column typesetting have a natural order of reading, documents with more adventurous layouts are challenging. As an example, it is not clear if the following inset should appear before, after, or during the article it is placed next to:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tdNisrVDTpYeRiVU.png" alt="paragraph order.PNG"></p><p>Second, even when the answer is clear to a human, determining robust paragraph order is a very difficult problem to solve, perhaps even AI-hard. This might sound like an extreme statement, however there are cases where the correct paragraph order can only be decided by understanding the text content.</p><p>Consider the following two-columns layout, describing how to prepare a vegetable salad:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LVpxBZtdQdXIYMfv.png" alt="recipe.png"></p><p>In the western world, a reasonable assumption is that reading is done left to right and top to bottom. So the best we can do without looking at the contents is to reduce the answer to 2 options: A B C D and A C B D.</p><p>By looking at the content, understanding what it is talking about and knowing that vegetables are washed before chopping, we can determine that A C B D is the correct order. Determining this algorithmically is a difficult problem.</p><p>That being said, a “works most times” approach is to rely on the order in which the text is stored inside the PDF document. This usually corresponds to the order the text was inserted at creation time and, for large bodies of text containing multiple paragraphs, they tend to reflect the writer-intended order.</p><h2>Embedded images</h2><p>It is not uncommon for some (or all) of the PDF content to actually be a scan. In these cases, there is no text data to extract directly, so we have to resort to OCR techniques.</p><p>As an example, the Yell 2011 annual report is only available as a document scan:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kMKEqcgsWNHNhiXI.png" alt="scan.PNG"></p><h2>Why not OCR all …</h2></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Jugaad is an attitude towards delivery which originated in India and consists of three simple tenets:</p>



<ul><li>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</li><li>Openness: keep your options open</li><li>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</li></ul>



<p>Jugaad is agility taken to the extreme and most suitable for projects with a high degree of change, risk and uncertainty. Nothing demonstrates the essence of jugaad better than the homonymous improvised vehicles built in India. All essential mechanical parts lay open and are easily accessible instead of being enclosed in casings. The vehicle can be assembled from commonly available, repurposed parts. It can be customised and extended to fit a variety of personal and professional needs, workloads and environments. The choice of parts can adapt the jugaad vehicle to different types of terrain, usage, fuel and availability of parts.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p>This post is not the result of studying literature, most of which seems to have been written around the peek of the jugaad hype in 2010. It rather distils the experience of a decade working with delivery teams in India, what I learned from their approach to delivery and from being immersed in Indian corporate culture. Through large parts of this post it may seem that I advocate the adoption of jugaad and the abolition of other agile methods; the opposite is true – I will try to make the point that the wholistic approach of jugaad to solution design should be paired with the tactical discipline of a framework like agile or XP.</p>



<h2>The tenets work together</h2>



<p>The three tenets (Humility, Openness, Frugality) complement and contradict each other in a beautiful way: Humility <em>generates</em> options for a solution, openness <em>guides</em> and <em>combines</em> them and frugality <em>eliminates</em> them. Only solutions adhering to all three tenets are built in the jugaad spirit.</p>

<h2>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</h2>



<p>Delivery methods like Waterfall, Scrum and XP wage religious wars over definitions (eg. what is the right sprint length?), processes (eg. degree of upfront planning), skills (eg. which framework should we use) and tools (eg. Maven or Gradle) all of which are more or less derivatives of adherence to a method. Jugaad replaces those definitions, processes, skills and tools with a central guidance: <em>be conscious about the shortcuts taken</em> with respect to the two other tenets. Jugaad frequently comes with a high degree of “out of the box” thinking and requires, for it to work, the humility to let go of technical and methodological preconceptions about what is the “appropriate” way and focus solely on the result.</p>



<p>Humility is the starting point in jugaad in that using “whatever works” generates a plethora of options. So how do we choose amongst these options? That is where Openness takes over.</p>



<h2>Openness: keep your options open</h2>



<p>The ostensible carelessness with which jugaad approaches delivery is built on the solid foundation of Openness. Whatever we build should be easy to extend, change or reverse. Openness often lacks elegance and conciseness, the inner workings of things are exposed, there is not much polish and one can see the parts a solution is made of – not to mention the security concerns arising from such solution. Just think of the jugaad vehicle we talked about earlier if you need a mental picture. But those trade-offs enable easily modifiable solutions and are exactly that: conscious trade-offs, not shortcomings. A solution which is open to change is a solid project or product foundation as it can adapt to unforeseen changes and doesn’t require much up-front design. Openness takes Humility’s options and guides them into coherent patterns. Not all options will form a good solution and not all combinations of options will work; Openness tells us which of them <em>might</em> work without losing an arm and a leg in the process of finding out.</p>



<h2>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</h2>



<p>Frugality is about risk management: reducing upfront costs <em>now </em>allows exploring more value propositions and solution approaches <em>now</em> while spending resources <em>later</em> on improving the solution. A low cost incurred early jeopardises a project less than a large cost incurred at the same time, especially if whatever that cost bought us turned out to be the wrong thing. Frugality is a holistic view on the patterns guided by Openness – it takes into consideration synergies between options and maximises value, both in terms of business value created for the solution (how many of the requirements were implemented at what effort) as well as value added to the project delivery (how much delivery and quality was improved, what was learned etc).</p>



<h2>Comparison by example</h2>



<p>Jugaad is illustrated best with a couple of examples which contrast traditional, “proper” design with improvised jugaad design.</p>



<h3>Example: receipt system</h3>



<p>Design a system that generates, stores and sends receipts via email to customers. Customer support should be able to retrieve receipts.</p>



<p>The traditional, “proper” solution:  we program a system that stores receipts in a relational database, generates receipt PDFs, stores those PDFs in the database, sends the PDFs to customers. We program a web interface for use by customer service which can query the database for receipts.</p>

<p>The jugaad-engineered solution: we program a system that generates HTML receipts, emails them to customers and BCCs a customer support email account with the same receipt. Customer support can use their email client to retrieve receipts. These components are either packaged and require no development effort (Customer support E-Mail client, E-Mail server), there a only few components and they are easy to implement.</p>

<p>Let’s evaluate the jugaad-engineered solution against jugaad’s tenets and compare it with the “traditional” solution.</p>



<p>Humility: the design relies on packaged components which probably already exist and it only minimally invades the existing IT landscape. It reuses high quality packaged solutions (e-mail server, e-mail client) which may already exist in the organisation and reduces implementation tasks to e-mail server and e-mail client configurations. The traditional delivery method places several requirements on how the solution is built: it mandates formal APIs, probably a particular technology platform, a pre-defined method according to which components are structured (eg. SOLID), technical documentation and thorough test automation long before it is clear that the project will make it into production, but nevertheless increasing conceptional and real complexity of the solution and the delivery process and requiring an increased skill set for project participants. </p>



<p>Openness: the e-mail protocols between the application, e-mail servers and e-mail clients are well understood and extensible. Using E-Mail clients requires low to no training and the IT department probably maintains them already. The components themselves can be substituted without affecting much the rest of the solution; eg. a new field can be added to future receipts without modifying already issued receipts. Because many components can be operated by human agents (the e-mail server and e-mail clients), many new features and workarounds can be implemented as manual processes before coding and automating them into software. Since not much effort has been put at the initial stage into upfront design there isn’t much effort wasted when requirements change and implementations follow.</p>



<p>Frugality: the use of packaged components, especially when they are already familiar, reduces implementation effort and speeds up delivery at the cost of the finished product showing incongruities where different components interface.  New requirements needing larger changes can be implemented by exchanging existing components for components better fitting the requirements or even rewriting them from scratch, if needed. In many cases the early progress made thanks to the low initial effort should more than make up for the higher, later cost. The traditional solution contrasts badly with jugaad in terms of effort. For example, it will mandate a particular API design such as a REST API for the receipt generator and receipt retrieval or even a REST API between the receipt generator and the email server, because… principles. Technical documentation will be written for the components long before it is clear that the project will ever go live, not considering that any effort spent on non-value adding features jeopardises a go-live. And last not least unit tests will be written to achieve an arbitrarily agreed upon test coverage before it is clear that they generate business value eg. by catching regressions. The jugaad-engineered solution will produce formal APIs, documentation and test automation when their added value outweighs the implementation effort.</p>



<h2>Contrast with agile</h2>



<p>Jugaad has no processes like Scrum or XP. It talks about the values worth striving for. It doesn’t talk about velocity or quality; even the focus on low cost introduces the discipline to achieving openness, thus being able to revisit a previously built solution. Agile highlights <em>reactiveness</em>, it’s main point being the ability to react to unforeseen changes, but it uses a predefined process such as Scrum or Kanban. The process must adapt to organisational changes or changing skill sets. Jugaad does not dictate any delivery process, so in a way it is orthogonal to existing agile practices. By adding formalised steps to it, a mature jugaad practice may evolve into Scrum or Kanban if that seems useful.</p>



<p>But jugaad is not about agile without …</p></div></div>

An unimaginable amount of suffering. Trying to comprehend it specifically and thoroughly makes me feel sick. It is staggering, the magnitude of pain.</p><p>At times the futility of <em>ever fixing this</em> breaks me. How Sisyphean it is, the prospect of searching interminably for new solutions to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140801022058/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordination problems</a>! I lament that positive-sum possibilities can barely be glimpsed through a tangle of innumerable constraints.</p><p>The fact is... it's true. There is tremendous suffering, beyond my ability to convey and beyond the auspices of the word "fix." Nothing can be said, no conclusion can be reached, that will negate that. It is what it is.</p><p>Reality does not have a human value system. The most you can say about the association between the two is that human value systems are figments within reality, gesturing at its structure. Sometimes the gesture is 🙏, sometimes it's 🖕, and everything in between.</p>

                      A very strong contender for Best Book I Read in 2017. After the nuclear apocalypse, history devours itself like an ouroboros. Science becomes religion becomes science becomes religion. Human nature doesn't improve, but it still has its moments of transcendent goodness.

                      Although her story has all the components of formulaic dirty realism, there is never any redneck posturing, no luxuriating in colourful bad language or behaviour. When she has a man cause a family crisis by telling his wife 'I wouldn't touch you even if you took a bath in whiskey tonic and put a bag over your head', it's not to glorify or denigrate a 'good ol' boy' but simply to report what he said.

<p>I am not one to cry from reading, but I imagine many a reader would when reading of the despair of life with a young family during a famine and of what they witness. There is much more emotional engagement elsewhere in the story, whether it is the despair of poverty; the frustration of the inequities between rich and poor, men and women, workers and freeloaders; the fear of violence and disappointment in the character's choices. [...]</p>
<p>Wang has known nothing other than the hardworking, precarious, life of a peasant. The life within the House of Hwang is as alien to him as the life of a Westerner. He does not consider how different his life might have been if he had been born into privilege. Nor does he realise, since upward financial and social mobility is his dream, how, if he were to succeed, it would change the way he feels about his wife, the way he would raise his sons or the life he would choose to lead. The thought that his sons might grow up in a completely different environment to himself, with personalities, opportunities, ambitions and wants completely foreign to his own would baffle him.</p>

                      Against a landscape as sparse as the trees on the ridge just yonder, anonymous characters, the ferryman, the snake hunter, the beekeeper, the preacher, pursue an unyielding existence. Only a little more identified here are Culla Holme and Rinthy, his nineteen-year-old sister who has just had (his?) child in a cabin. A day or two later he tells her it has died, while going off with the tinker to leave the child elsewhere (where?). Rinthy as soon as she is strong enough goes on her long search to find the tinker and her child[.]

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an incredible time in human history where the basic infrastructure for many of us is so good.</p><p>In today’s world it is possible to get ahead and achieve a lot all by yourself. You can be a writer with 1mn readers, a social media star with 1mn followers, or a SaaS business with $1mn in ARR.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the mindset Sankalp and I both embodied when we first started on our journey. We had faith that just the 2 of us working together towards our shared goal is enough to get us really far.</p><p>Thankfully that faith turned into reality and lead to the success of SuperLemon.</p><h3>Challenging our beliefs</h3><p>But any great mindset or philosophy is only as great as the people who practice it, and people are always evolving and getting better. Mindset and philosophy evolves too.</p><p>The people in our lives who believed in us and wanted us to do even better challenged us on our beliefs of doing things amongst just the 2 of us.</p><p>One of them said - we are setting small goals, because we are afraid of hiring. If we had the confidence that we can put together a great team, we would think bigger and set higher goals.</p><p>We knew in our hearts that the challenge was genuine. Due to our poor experiences with hiring in the past, we started favouring the path of least resistance, which is to not try to hire anyone. Automatically our goals would only be as lofty as how much the two of us can achieve together. </p><p>We had to change this about ourselves. And so we immediately set out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93/status/1296089975818055680" target="_blank">hire someone amazing</a> into our team. It was an exercise to prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to do this.</p><h3>An updated mindset</h3><p>Less than a month later, we hired an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">first engineer</a> and have made an offer to another. This exercise has turned out way better than we anticipated, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It allowed us to dream bigger.</p><p>Our mindset and philosophy has thus been updated - We can get far in today’s world just by ourselves, but if we want to get really really far with our next venture <a href="https://delight.chat/" target="_blank">Delight.chat</a>, we need more than just the two of us.&nbsp;</p><p>While we suddenly haven't started wanting to build a 400 person company, our mindset has evolved enough to accept and understand how building a team of 5-15 people could produce a 100x result of what we had previously set out to achieve.</p><h3>People on the inside</h3><p>We need people on the inside (a team) who are aligned with our shared vision, and working together using their mind and abilities towards achieving that goal. </p><p>It's not just having more hands in the engineering team in building the product, or marketing team in creating content or distribution channels.</p><p>Their consciousness, ideas, problem solving abilities, attitude and values get added into a collective pool with our own. The sum is greater than the parts.</p><p>The people joining our team are entrepreneurial minds whose values align with ours, who want to build and grow something new and challenging from the ground up, learn from the experience, and eventually start their own companies. We will be their first supporters when they do. Psst, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-our-tribe-at-Delight-chat-dfb896c946a843ebb58bbb1cc161fe33#dfa80f89af17410e9076d1d4fbfcff35" target="_blank">we are hiring</a>.</p><h3>People on the outside</h3><p>We need people on the outside (advisors, investors) who are aligned with our end goal of building a great company, and are going out of their way in helping us get there. </p><p>They align with our mindset of building a real business that thrives without burning $1 for 70 cents,&nbsp;delivers real value to end users, and grows to a reasonably large size while being profitable.</p><p>Their experience observing other entrepreneurs and companies will help us avoid common pitfalls, make better connections like key hires, and open up doors that we can't even imagine today, because we don't know those doors exist. Serendipity.</p><h3>Onwards</h3><p>I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that we have a handful of such people who believe in us, and who are now working with us towards achieving our shared goal.</p><p>Together, we will reach farther than we previously dared to imagine.</p><p>Off we go towards the next milestone in this great adventure.</p></div></div>]]>
