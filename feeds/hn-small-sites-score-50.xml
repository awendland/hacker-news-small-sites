<p>Explorer is a power tool for GPT-3 experimentation with <strong>full history</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, and the community’s <strong>best-practices</strong> built-in. If you’re just getting started with GPT-3 or don’t want to build out your own boilerplate codebase, try the hosted version: <a href="https://gpt-3-explorer.vercel.app/">Explorer</a>. The source is available <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-ui-for-experimentation">A UI for experimentation</h2>

<p>To get good results from GPT-3, you need to experiment. (Despite what the cherry-picked examples on Twitter will have you believe!)</p>

<p>This fundamental insight led to Explorer’s first feature: saved history. They say the difference between tinkering and science is rigor and reproducibility. We codified that transition by making all our prompts and settings automatically saved and shareable. Annotations further allowed us to build and improve upon previous results.</p>

<p>Long term, we envision an environment that enables the development of higher level APIs on top of GPT-3. A system for designing pipelines of prompts, complex scripts, logic to retrieve external information — that can all be published for use in products and research.</p>

<p>Building complex applications requires you to work at a higher level of abstraction than machine code. <strong>How can we build an open source operating system for GPT-3 at the dawn of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>?</strong></p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved!</h2>

<p>There’s a long road ahead and we’re thankful for all of your feedback and suggestions so far. We welcome code contributions to Explorer - pop over to <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer">the repository</a> to learn how you can get it running locally!</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="building-together">Building together</h3>

<p>The community is continually discovering incredible methods for unlocking GPT-3’s potential. Without the right set of tools, most practitioners struggle to find and implement these new techniques.</p>

<p>That’s where we see the need for an open source project where we can all rapidly experiment and codify what we’ve learned. Here are some of the community’s methods and best practices that we’re excited to incorporate as features in Explorer:</p>

<p><strong>Prompt chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This method skirts the token limit by “chaining” together prompts and their outputs.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gptprompts.wikidot.com/chaining:chaining">Chaining</a> breaks down larger tasks into component sub-tasks, before composing them back together in a single prompt to get your final result.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Context stuffing</strong></p>

<p>This is a method of iterative prompt improvement that involves:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running an initial prompt</li>
  <li>Cherrypicking the best GPT-3 outputs,</li>
  <li>Appending them to the original prompt, to provide more examples for GPT-3 to use.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="the-roadmap">The Roadmap</h3>

<p>In the coming months, with your help, we plan to build these features (and more!). As the private beta comes to an end, let’s enable new GPT-3 users to hit the ground running with the cumulative, collective insights of the community.</p>

<p>As we receive feedback and contributions from the community, this roadmap will continue to change and be reprioritized. You can follow a live version of it <a href="https://github.com/belay-labs/gpt-explorer/projects/1">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and importing prompts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>“GitHub for Prompts”. Let’s make it easy to share and build on each others’ work!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prompt evaluation</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GPT’s performance is very, very sensitive to prompt design. So iterating on prompt design is our highest priority.</li>
  <li>With built-in tools for prompt evaluation, you can annotate, rank and sort results for the same task across different prompt designs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scripting &amp; chaining</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable commands which can trigger scripts.</li>
  <li>These scripts can then: <em>i.</em> do computation, or <em>ii.</em> trigger API requests to do actions, get more information, call other prompts, etc.</li>
  <li>In particular, this scripting interface can chain prompts together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Higher level API interface</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The OpenAI API is all about simplicity, it is a raw text-in, text-out interface, which is great to build on top of but does not make it easy to best take advantage of the tool.</li>
  <li>We envision a higher level API which you can use to develop higher-level reasoning and operations on top of the low level API. Turn any prompt, which itself can be a pipeline of other prompts, into an API.</li>
  <li>This enables a more broadly useful natural language interface for: chat, question answering, text transformations, multi-step labeling, and other pipelines of natural language operations</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <main id="main-content"> <section> <div>   <p>We’re excited to announce the first beta release and general availability of the <strong>Rome</strong> linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p> <p>This is the beginning of an entire suite of tools. Rome is not only linter, but also a compiler, bundler, test runner, and <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/#development-status">more</a>, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. We aim to unify the entire frontend development toolchain.</p> <p>Rome is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tool containing functionality that has traditionally been separate tools in the frontend ecosystem. We call this a toolchain. It is <strong>not</strong> a collection of existing tools, but completely custom, built <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/credits">largely</a> from scratch, contained entirely in a single package and codebase.</p> <p>Rome is designed to replace <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, and others.</p> <p>We have significant implementations already for most components, including compiling, bundling, and testing, all using the same core abstractions and internal libraries. Rome is even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(compilers)">self-hosted</a> and we use them to <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">build and develop Rome itself</a>! Once usage as a linter has stabilized, we will move onto the unreleased features to prepare and generalize them for public usage.</p> <p>Linting is an excellent low-risk way for us to mature and validate shared functionality like editor integration, configuration, parallelization, caching, parsing, and dependency analysis. It is not in the critical build path for development so is relatively straight forward and safe to adopt.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span> rome check

See the full <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/docs/lint/rules">list of rules</a>. You can expect a full featured experience, however may still encounter bugs. With most of the feature development out of the way we will be focusing primarily on stability.</p> <p>Most of our rules have been inspired by their ESLint equivalents. This required a complete rewrite to utilize Rome’s API that differ extensively from existing tools. Without the amazing work of the ESLint team and community establishing these recommended patterns, we would not have been able to pull this off. Refer to the <a href="https://romefrontend.dev/docs/lint/rules">lint rule docs</a> for direct references.</p> <p>Since open sourcing, at the beginning of the year, we have received contributions from over <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/graphs/contributors">70 contributors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/romefrontend/rome/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged">600 pull requests</a>.

At the time I wasn’t trying to solve any particular problem, I was just building and experimenting with existing libraries and teaching myself new concepts. Over time though, as the project exploded in popularity, so did the scope and mission of the project.</p> <p>We renamed <strong>6to5</strong> to <strong>Babel</strong> to take on a new role as a general platform for doing static JavaScript transformation. This meant a plugin system and a new commitment to supporting future JavaScript standards and proposed features.</p> <p>We also planned on expanding Babel to be used as the base for other JavaScript language tooling by using shared public libraries. From the Babel blog post “<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0">6.0.0 Released</a>” by <a href="https://twitter.com/buildsghost">Jamie Kyle</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>But we think we can go even further. Babel should be able to power minifiers, linters, formatters, syntax highlighters, code completion tools, type checkers, codemod tools, and every other tool to be using the same foundation to do their job better than ever before.</p> </blockquote> <figure> <img width="600" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/6to5-to-babel.png" alt="Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo"> <figcaption>Old 6to5 logo with an arrow pointing to the new Babel logo</figcaption> </figure> <p>In 2016, I left the project, and those plans never materialized. Over time, I learned the Babel would not have been able to successfully adapt to execute on this vision anyway. The solution to plugins was “expose all the internals” which is an extremely large API surface area to maintain and restricts your ability to make any changes.</p> <p>Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers.</p> <p>There would have been no way to provide backward compatibility, and with expectations already set, any significant changes to the project would have introduced an extremely high amount of ecosystem churn.</p> <p>In an ode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a>, if all components of an object are replaced, is it the same object? There is far less confusion and friction to release something entirely new than drastically change something that’s already in widespread usage. I had since moved on from the project, and so any evolution would not have been possible, and would have required complete vision alignment.</p> <p>Even though I wasn’t involved in Babel, I still maintained a presence in the developer tooling ecosystem. I eventually went on to develop other tools like <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and be involved in projects like <a href="https://prepack.io/">Prepack</a> and <a href="https://fbflipper.com/">Flipper</a>. This work continued to develop the ideas that would eventually become Rome and shaped my philosophy on developer experience. A focus on excellent errors, clean user interface, and minimal configuration.</p> <figure> <img width="500" src="https://romefrontend.dev/img/blog/introducing-rome-post-babel-logos.png" alt="The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper"> <figcaption>The logos of Yarn, Prepack, and Flipper</figcaption> </figure> <p>The original idea behind Babel had always stuck. What sort of capabilities would be possible if a tool did more than one thing? This sort of philosophy has always seemed alien in the JavaScript ecosystem where micropackages and arbitrary separation of concerns are the norms. These tools being independent has never provided the sort of user autonomy and efficiency that most skeptics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application">monolithic</a> tools proclaim.</p> <p>Language tooling maintainers spend so much time working on the same things. Processing source code, whether it’s in a transpiler like Babel, linting it in ESLint, or bundling it in Webpack, is fundamentally the same problem with overlapping responsibilities and technical implementation.</p> <p>A linter in the JavaScript ecosystem is exactly the same as a compiler. They both consume code, then produce compiled code and errors. What the compiled code is varies. In the case of a linter, the compiled code is formatted source code with automatic fixes applied. The more powerful your compilation infrastructure, the more theoretically powerful your linter could be. These commonalities extend to pretty much anything that involves language processing. We can build more powerful tools using a shared base that is easily adaptable.</p> <p>I had always maintained private repos where I would experiment with ideas, but the original code that would become Rome was started at the beginning of 2017 while I was working for Facebook in my free time. I continued iterating and experimenting on the idea and building out all the different pieces, until 2019, when I was given the opportunity to work on and explore using it at Facebook full-time.</p> <p>I eventually left Facebook and the project became open source in February 2020 where I would continue it as an independent community-driven project.</p> <p>Rome is the spiritual successor of Babel. I’ve taken the lessons I learnt, and refined the mission. Rather than exposing a large public API for other tools to be built on, we are building them all in one place, with batteries included. I’m excited to be trying something new that the JavaScript and web ecosystem haven’t seen before.</p> <p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/sebmck">Sebastian McKenzie</a></p> </section>  </div> </section> </main> </div></div>]]>

                    <p>In this article, we will learn about India's Unified Payments Interface. A four-year-old payment scheme that has been accounting for 40-45% of digital payments across India. In December 2019, Google <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/November/20191113/OP-1670/OP-1670_110719_136981_396266957468_1.pdf">recommended</a> the Federal Reserve to follow the model of UPI for the design of FedNow.</p><p>It is going to be a 3 part series.</p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>(this article): We will cover the background and basics. We will learn about the different participants and their roles in the UPI ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-transaction-lifecycle"><strong>Part 2:</strong></a> We take a deep-dive into UPI by tracing a UPI transaction from the beginning through the end.</p><p><strong><a href="https://the-other-side.blog/upi-the-settlement">Part 3:</a></strong> We will look at settlements and understand how money exchanges hands.</p><hr><h3 id="background">Background</h3><p>Since its inception in 2016, UPI has grown tremendously over the last 4 years. It has enabled a whole new set of individuals to transact digitally for the first time.</p><p>There were multiple attempts towards making India a cashless society. Earlier solutions were not simple to use and relied heavily on Netbanking facilities provided by the banks. The experience was not standard. Because of all these reasons, it was mostly used only by the tech-savvy population. India being a diverse country needed a system that has a plethora of payment apps that are optimised for different cohorts.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png" alt="" width="1468" height="1088" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/upi_transaction_growth.png 1468w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Growth of UPI</figcaption></figure><p>The primary objective of UPI was to build an open payment system that is mobile-first, fast, and interoperable across different banks.</p><p>For a developing country like India, going mobile-first was almost a no brainer. Mobile Phones and Mobile Data were getting cheaper and the trend was clear.</p><p>Interoperability simply puts the user’s needs at the center. The users can opt for any payment app, link it with their bank account to engage in commerce with anyone across India.</p><p>Think about it, all of us want to use payment apps that we like, instead of being limited to a poorly designed app that’s provided by the bank where we keep our money. We should let banks do what they do best (which is managing money) and let tech companies handle building intuitive user interfaces for transacting money.</p><p>UPI was built on this principle to let private players innovate on top of public digital infrastructure.</p><h3 id="so-what-exactly-is-upi">So, What exactly is UPI?</h3><p>UPI is a payment markup language and a standard for interoperable payments in India.</p><p>To make the process of transacting money simple, UPI introduced the concept of human friendly unique IDs called UPI Virtual Payment Addresses (or VPAs). The VPAs are usually of the form <strong><em>&lt;unique_identifier&gt;</em></strong>@<strong><em>&lt;address_provider&gt;</em></strong>.</p><p>The UPI VPAs are similar to email addresses. They are interoperable. A gmail user can send an email to a yahoo user. </p><p>Some simple examples UPI VPAs are <strong><em>alice@ybl </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob@axis</em></strong>. Here, <strong><em>ybl</em></strong> and <strong><em>axis </em></strong>are two banks that provide virtual payment addresses. And, <strong><em>alice </em></strong>and<strong><em> bob </em></strong>are the unique identifiers in respective address providers.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1064" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/payment_markup.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/06/payment_markup.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Just like how domains get resolved to IP addresses, every VPA needs to be linked to a bank account. The UPI handles get resolved to bank accounts and IFSC during the payment (we will see how).</p><p>In short, a UPI Virtual Payment Address serves as the addressing layer for a bank account.</p><p>There are mainly two types of transactions in the UPI realm.</p><h4 id="direct-payment">Direct Payment</h4><p>The payer (the sender) initiates the transaction. Typical examples would be, you paying a shopkeeper at the checkout by scanning a QR code or you sending money to your friends and family.</p><h4 id="collect-request">Collect Request</h4><p>The payee (the receiver) initiates the transaction. A simple example is a scenario where your landlord creates a collect request asking you to pay the monthly rent.</p><hr><h2 id="the-ecosystem">The Ecosystem</h2><p>There are three types of participants in the UPI ecosystem.</p><h3 id="the-banks">The Banks</h3><p>Banks hold your money. UPI works directly with the bank accounts, unlike Paytm, Venmo, or CashApp. The bank account will be debited from or credited to whenever you send money or receive money.</p><p>The banks that hold your money are also called <em>Issuing Banks</em>.</p><p>Every bank uses a system called Core Banking System (CBS) to manage its user’s accounts. At the core, CBS is a simple <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud" rel="noopener">CRUD</a> system built around user accounts.</p><p>Debit and Credit are the two fundamental operations of core banking software.The debit is when you’re taking money out of your account. The amount involved is subtracted from your balance. On the other hand, when you’re getting paid, its a credit. The money is added to your account.</p><p>Banks also maintain another UPI specific database. We will discuss more on that later.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png" alt="" width="2328" height="1840" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/banks_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/banks_intro.png 2328w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-payment-apps">The Payment Apps</h3><p>Payment Apps are consumer-centric products that can be used to link a bank account and transact in the real world. Some major apps are Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc. Almost all the banks have their own versions of UPI Apps. There is a wide variety of options to chose from.</p><p>Payment Apps allow users to create handles to make everyday transactions easier. However, not everyone can start creating UPI handles. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates who can create UPI handles. Currently, only the member banks of the UPI ecosystem are allowed to do so.</p><p>That’s why all the payment apps will have to tie up with banks. These banks not only allow payment apps to create and manage UPI handles for their users, but they are also the interface to the UPI ecosystem.</p><p>These banks are called <em>Acquiring Banks</em>.</p><p>Google Pay has tied up with HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI. PhonePe has a tie-up with Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.</p><p>Banks provide separate APIs to allow payment apps to create and manage the UPI handles.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png" alt="" width="2540" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/payment_apps_intro.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="npci">NPCI</h3><p>National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a non-profit set up by the Government of India to facilitate digital payments. They facilitate many payment schemes (like IMPS, BBPS, FASTag, etc.)</p><p>If we reflect back on the original objective of UPI, it was to build an interoperable system. An interoperable means anyone could download a payment app, link any bank (that they own), and transact with anyone else from any other bank.</p><p>One primitive way of building such an interoperable network would be to connect every payment app with every bank. As you’re probably guessing, that’s a very inefficient way of doing it, even if we assume something like that is possible. It practically not possible.</p><p>And, the only thing that’s constant in the software realm, is the fact that systems keep changing and breaking. Imagine the pain that everyone has to go through in reaching a consensus when configurations or infrastructures change. It would be chaos.</p><p>This approach is the same as building an Internet where your browser has to remember the IP address of every possible website on the planet, otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to access it.</p><p>Of course, the Internet is not built in this fashion. The job of resolving every web address into an IP address is taken out as a separate protocol called DNS. Our browsers trust the IP address resolved by the DNS servers used by our Internet Service Providers.</p><p>Introducing standardization and a trusted third party will result in a completely different architecture.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png" alt="" width="3000" height="1520" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/interoperable_systems.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>That’s the route UPI creators took, they made NPCI as the trusted switch and they standardized the protocol. NPCI makes sure that data flow between banks and payment apps are routed to the correct and verified destinations.</p><p>The end result, the payment apps, and banks talk just to NPCI and can be assured by NPCI that they are really interacting with who they intend to.</p><p>To make this easy to understand, we made a GIF.</p><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="851" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/npci_switch.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Apart from being the trusted router, NPCI also hosts non-financial meta APIs to serve everyone in the ecosystem.</p><p>Some examples of meta API are <em>listAccountProviders (returns all details of all banks), validateAddress (helps in validating VPAs), requestOtp (for 2FA), </em>etc.</p><p>NPCI has one more important role to play. It’s something to do with settlement. We will cover in the last part of the series.</p><hr><p>Before we wrap the first series, let's quickly visit authentication.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>UPI uses 2-factor authentication. Commonly used factors are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Possession_factors" rel="noopener">possession factor</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Knowledge_factors" rel="noopener">knowledge factor</a>.</p><p>UPI being mobile-first, the possession factor (“what a user has”) is the user’s phone.

<p><a href="https://www.prepear.com/">Prepear</a> is a meal planner and grocery list app that helps people discover recipes and more. It’s a spin off from the founders of <em><a href="https://www.superhealthykids.com/">Super Healthy Kids</a></em> and right now they saying its logo is under legal attack from Apple.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>It’s funny what Instagram accounts you follow as a parent at some point. Yesterday, we noticed <em>Super Healthy Kids</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmcFEInZK7/">sharing a post</a> detailing their new legal woes with Apple.</p>
<p>According to the founders, Apple “has opposed the trademark application for our small business, Prepear, demanding that we change our obviously pear shaped logo, used to represent our brand in the recipe management and meal planning business.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">In a petition on Change.org</a>, Prepear goes on to say, “before attacking us, Apple has opposed dozens of other trademark applications filed by small businesses with fruit related logos. Many of those logos were changed or abandoned. Most small businesses cannot afford the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost to fight Apple.”</p>
<p>Prepear says they are a small company with only five staff and legal costs have already cost them “many thousands of dollars” plus laying off one team member, in their legal fight against the iPhone maker.</p>
<p>“It is a very terrifying experience to be legally attacked by one of the largest companies in the world, even when we have clearly done nothing wrong, and we understand why most companies just give in and change their logos,” adds Prepear in its plea for support.</p>
<p>Prepear says they “feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple’s aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.”</p>
<p>So far, just over 8,200 signatures have been signed out of a goal of 10,000 on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos?recruiter=1137882952&amp;recruited_by_id=ebcd47e0-d5d9-11ea-95f3-73a235808f2d&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard">change.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the two logos above, I can’t say the Prepear logo resembles the Apple logo at all. But of course, Apple feels different about that.</p>
<p>Prepear is a free app and available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prepear/id1248495163">download on iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prepear.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can check out Apple’s trademark opposition filed above (via <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/08/legal-action-against-company-with-pear-logo/">MacRumors</a></em>).</p>
<p><strong>Update August 9</strong>: Prepear’s COO, Russ Monson, told <em>iPhone in Canada</em> in an email more insight in regards to the company’s filing of their trademark for the ‘pear’ logo.</p>
<p>Monson says Prepear filed their trademark for the logo back in January 2017 and eventually was told by the U.S. Trademark office “that it was not in conflict with any other registered trademarks and that they would publish it for opposition.” Everything seemed good to go.</p>
<p>That was until on the “on the last day of the window to oppose the trademark we received notice that Apple had filed for an extension of the window to oppose, and they subsequently filed for additional extensions which put our trademark in legal limbo for an extended period of time.”</p>
<p>According to Monson, Apple filed their actual opposition on the final day they were legally allowed. Subsequent extensions filed result in more legal fees for a company like Prepear to take on, which they said “seemed designed by their legal team to be made as long, difficult, and expensive as possible for us.”</p>
<p>Monson goes on to explain Prepear was “naive enough” to think they could discuss the matter with Apple rationally, as both logos look different. But that wasn’t the case and the opposition has reached the ‘discovery phase’, which the COO says will “be the most expensive part of this case for us.”</p>
<p>After Apple filed to proceed to discovery phase, that’s what Prepear decided to start their petition. “We believe that this case is clearly frivolous, and that once the public is aware of Apple’s position on this that Apple will be more willing to drop the case rather than have the public see how they are clearly harming us for no apparent justifiable reason,” said Monson to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em></p>
<p>Prepear says they aren’t asking for a boycott of Apple products, but they are asking the iPhone maker to “stop attacking small businesses like ours in frivolous cases that seem designed to cause us to spend as much money and time thinking about the case instead of focusing on how to grow our business and ensure we survive the current economic crisis.”</p>
<p>Monson shared with<em> iPhone in Canada</em> some other oppositions Apple had previously filed against, in a similar fashion to what is happening them right now. These companies below gave up when Apple reached out, but Prepear says they are lucky to garner enough media attention “to expose this practice by Apple.”</p>

<p>Prepear says it will be handing its petition of signatures–which currently stands at nearly 19,000 signatures–to Apple soon and will be sharing updates on what happens. The company explains to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it hopes Apple will drop the case before it gets to more expensive discovery and trial phases.</p>

  <div>
    <p>So far everything we’ve done with breakpoints involved us creating a breakpoint file and using this
to automate part of a track. Now we’ll take a look at how we can take an existing track and extract
some breakpoints from this. For this post, we’ll take a look at extracting the amplitudes from the
.wave files, as this is one of the most straightforward properties that we can extract.</p>
<p>There is nothing here that we’ve not seen in the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/tags/goaudio/">previous
posts</a>, but rather we are going to combine what we’ve
already learned to create a new tool to do this.</p>
<p>In a high level overview, we’ll have to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>iterate over our frames</li>
<li>record the given amplitude (frame value)</li>
<li>write to breakpoint file</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence this would be simple enough, but we’ll make two small modifications to this
algorithm. First of all, we don’t want to just generate a breakpoint for each frame, this would just
result in a list that is equal to our frame data. We’ll use less space by just taking a snapshot at
a certain interval, e.g every 10ms, and take advantage of
our linear interpolation that happens when looking up the value of a breakpoint at a certain time.</p>
<p>A small extention to our current breakpoint code is that we need to be able to ‘batch’ the samples
into slices of a given time.</p>
<p>If you want to get to the code, everything can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio/blob/master/cmd/extractbrk/main.go">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The BatchSamples function will take a <code>Wave</code> and <code>seconds float64</code> as input, as this gives us enough
data to batch the frames. Given a certain SampleRate, we know how many Samples per Second we are
seeing in the file. With this information, we can find the amount of Frames per Seconds. Although
frames per second is only equal to the samples per second for mono files, but adapting for
multi-channel audio is just a matter of multiplying the SampleSize by the amount of channels.</p>
<p>The SampleSize can thus be expressed as follows: <code>SampleSize = SampleRate * Channels * seconds</code></p>
<p>When we know our sample size, we can split the raw frames into slices of this size.</p>

<p>Once we can split our frames into batches, we can call <code>BatchSamples(wave,x)</code> to get the requested
batches of a given duration. Then, we can find the max amplitude over all of these and keep
track of this over all batches.</p>
<p>The setup code is the same as usual, where we parse an input file with
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a>. Except that now we’ll also send the frames to the
‘BatchSamples’ function. (Error handling ignored for brevity)</p>

<p>When we run this program <code>go run main.go -i input.wav -w 15 -o output.brk</code> we can generate a
breakpoint file. I’ve created a sample waveform (something I’ll write a future blogpost about) with
variable amplitude. You can listen to it <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/input.wav">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extracted breakpoint file can be seen <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/audio/part7/output.brk">here</a>.</p>
<p>Using audacity and your favourite plotting tool you can compare the waveform with what the
breakpoint extractor generated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">

<p>I bought Avnet's $49 Spartan 3A development board but it was discontinued not long afterward - right about the time when I decided I needed a few dozen more. I've since done some extensive research (thanks, Google!) to find a comparable thrifty thrill.
</p>
<p>When choosing a development board, consider what you get with it and what you want to use it for. FPGAs are ideal for use with high speed peripherals, and in general it is much easier to buy a board that contains the part you want, rather than trying to add one on later (and inevitably giving up and upgrading to a more capable board). Examples of things you might want, and are quite difficult to add yourself:
</p>
<ul><li>Gigabit Ethernet
</li><li>HDMI/DVI
</li><li>PCI/PCI Express
</li><li>External non-serial memory (DDR/Flash etc.)
</li></ul><p>Things that are relatively easy to add, and are not so much of a big deal to wire up yourself.
</p>
<ul><li>MMC/SD cards
</li><li>Character (e.g. 16x2) LCDs
</li><li>Anything I2C/SPI and relatively low speed
</li><li>VGA (with low colour depth)
</li></ul><p>I like having a board with many (at least 8) SPST switches and LEDs, and momentary buttons. Unlike a microcontroller where it's relatively easy to spit debug information out of a serial port or to an LCD with a single C function call, debugging FPGA designs is a bit harder. LEDs  provide a zero fuss way to break out internal signals for visualisation - if you're tracking the progress of a complex state machine, you can light up an LED when it gets to a certain point without adding any extra logic. While these are easy enough to add yourself, I find that it's better to get a board that has them so that you don't waste valuable user IOs or waste time investigating failures caused by your terrible soldering skills.
</p>
<p>Some manufacturers promote a standard form factor for add-ons, notably Digilent with their very wide range of <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/">Pmods</a>, the Papilio One's <a href="http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Wings">Wings</a>, and Arduino shields.
</p>
<p>If you would like to connect high speed devices (above 10-20 MHz) to your FPGA, make sure your board has an interface connector that supports the speeds you'll be using. Look for ground wires interspersed regularly between signal wires, high speed connectors (not just 0.1" headers), PCB trace length equalisation, and impedance control. Few of the cheap boards bother with any of these.
</p>
<p>FPGAs can be a bit daunting, so check that the manufacturer provides:
</p>
<ul><li>Schematic diagram
</li><li>A reference manual, describing all of the on-board peripherals
</li><li>A guide to getting started, if you've never used an FPGA before
</li><li>A reference design that exercises all on-board peripherals.
</li></ul><p>Reference designs can either be HDL or microcontroller-based, but in recent boards, most manufacturers seem to be moving to the latter. Bear this in mind if you don't have a license for the microcontroller and environment (e.g. Xilinx EDK/SDK is not free), as the code will be difficult to port to HDL.
</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, you may benefit from buying a board that has a companion textbook which has been written specifically for the board in mind, and describes each of the peripherals and how to interface with them. Popular boards with larger user communities may also be worth considering above cheaper options. The most popular Xilinx boards are those made by Xilinx (none of them cheap enough to be listed here), Digilent and Avnet. Terasic seem to make the most popular Altera boards.
</p>

<p>A long-standing complaint with vendor FPGA design tools is that they are generally enormous, complicated, slow, buggy, closed source, and are either expensive or have annoying license requirements. The open source community has made great progress in recent years to reimplement parts or all of the FPGA design toolchain and to address all of these concerns.
</p>
<p>FPGA devices which are currently either partially or fully supported by open source tools include:
</p>
<ul><li>Xilinx Spartan 6
</li><li>Xilinx Series 7 (Artix 7, Kintex 7, Virtex 7, Zynq with Series 7 Fabric)
</li><li>Xilinx Ultrascale(+)
</li><li>Lattice iCE40
</li><li>Lattice ECP5
</li><li>QuickLogic EOS S3 and PolarPro3

<p>If you read a description of a static analysis in a paper, what might you find? There’ll be some cute model of a language. Maybe some inference rules describing the analysis itself, but those rules probably rely on a variety of helper functions. These days, the analysis likely involves some logical reasoning: about the terms in the language, the branches conditionals might take, and so on.</p>



<p>What makes a language good for implementing such an analysis? You’d want a variety of features:</p>



<ul><li>Algebraic data types to model the language AST.</li><li>Logic programming for cleanly specifying inference rules.</li><li>Pure functional code for writing the helper functions.</li><li>An SMT solver for answering logical queries.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~bembenek/">Aaron Bembenek</a>, <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/">Steve Chong</a>, and I have developed a design that hits the sweet spot of those four points: given Datalog as a core, you add constructors, pure ML, and a type-safe interface to SMT. If you set things up just right, the system is a powerful and ergonomic way to write static analyses.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog">Formulog</a> is our prototype implementation of our design; our <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">paper on Formulog and its design</a> was just conditionally accepted to <a href="https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla">OOPSLA 2020</a>. To give a sense of why I’m excited, let me excerpt from our <a href="https://github.com/HarvardPL/formulog/blob/master/examples/liquid_types.flg">simple liquid type checker</a>. Weighing in under 400 very short lines, it’s a nice showcase of how expressive Formulog is. (Our paper discusses substantially more complex examples.)</p>



<pre>type base =
&nbsp;&nbsp;| base_bool

type typ = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_tvar(tvar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_fun(var, typ, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_forall(tvar, typ)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| typ_ref(var, base, exp)

and exp = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(var)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(bool)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(op)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(var, typ, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(tvar, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(exp, exp)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(exp, typ)
</pre>



<p>ADTs let you define your AST in a straightforward way. Here, <code>bool</code> is our only base type, but we could add more. Let’s look at some of the inference rules:</p>



<pre>(* subtyping *)
output sub(ctx, typ, typ)

(* bidirectional typing rules *)
output synth(ctx, exp, typ)
output check(ctx, exp, typ)

(* subtyping between refinement types is implication *)
sub(G, typ_ref(X, B, E1), typ_ref(Y, B, E2)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_ctx(G),
&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_subst(Y, exp_var(X), E2) = E2prime,
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_ctx(G, PhiG),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E1, Phi1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;encode_exp(E2prime, Phi2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;is_valid(`PhiG /\ Phi1 ==&gt; Phi2`).

(* lambda and application synth rules *)
synth(G, exp_lam(X, T1, E), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;wf_typ(G, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(ctx_var(G, X, T1), E, T2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_fun(X, T1, T2) = T.

synth(G, exp_app(E1, E2), T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E1, typ_fun(X, T1, T2)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;check(G, E2, T1),
&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E2, T2) = T.

(* the only checking rule *)
check(G, E, T) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;synth(G, E, Tprime),
&nbsp;&nbsp;sub(G, Tprime, T).</pre>



<p>First, we declare our relations—that is, the (typed) inference rules we’ll be using. We show the most interesting case of subtyping: refinement implication. Several helper relations (<code>wf_ctx</code>, <code>encode_*</code>) and helper functions (<code>exp_subst</code>) patch things together. The typing rules below follow a similar pattern, mixing the <code>synth</code> and <code>check</code> bidirectional typing relations with calls to helper functions like <code>typ_subst</code>.</p>



<pre>fun exp_subst(X: var, E : exp, Etgt : exp) : exp =
&nbsp;&nbsp;match Etgt with
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_var(Y) =&gt; if X = Y then E else Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_bool(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_op(_) =&gt; Etgt
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_lam(Y, Tlam, Elam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Yfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh_for(Y, X::append(typ_freevars(Tlam), exp_freevars(Elam)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Elamfresh = 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Y = Yfresh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Elam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else exp_subst(Y, exp_var(Yfresh), Elam)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_lam(Yfresh,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typ_subst(X, E, Tlam),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elamfresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tlam(A, Etlam) =&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tlam(A, exp_subst(X, E, Etlam))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_app(E1, E2) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_app(exp_subst(X, E, E1), exp_subst(X, E, E2))
&nbsp;&nbsp;| exp_tapp(Etapp, T) =&gt; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exp_tapp(exp_subst(X, E, Etapp), typ_subst(X, E, T))
&nbsp;&nbsp;end</pre>



<p>Expression substitution might be boring, but it shows the ML fragment well enough. It’s more or less the usual ML, though functions need to have pure interfaces, and we have a few restrictions in place to keep typing simple in our prototype.</p>



<p>There’s lots of fun stuff that doesn’t make it into this example: not only can relations call functions, but functions can examine relations (so long as everything is stratified). Hiding inside <code>fresh_for</code> is a clever approach to name generation that guarantees freshness… but is also deterministic and won’t interfere with parallel execution. The <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> has more substantial examples.</p>



<p>We’re not the first to combine logic programming and SMT. What makes our design a sweet spot is that it doesn’t let SMT get in the way of Datalog’s straightforward and powerful execution model. Datalog execution is readily parallelizable; the magic sets transformation can turn Datalog’s exhaustive, bottom-up search into a goal-directed one. It’s not news that Datalog can turn these tricks—<a href="https://bitbucket.org/yanniss/doop/src/master/">Yiannis Smaragdakis has been saying it for years</a>!—but integrating Datalog cleanly with ML functions and SMT is new. Check out the <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/formulog_sub2020.pdf">draft paper</a> for a detailed related work comparison. While our design is, in the end, not so complicated, getting there was hard.</p>



<p>Relatedly, we have also have an <a href="https://cs.pomona.edu/~michael/papers/iclp2020_extabs.pdf">extended abstract at ICLP 2020</a>, detailing some experiments in using incremental solving modes from Formulog. You might worry that Datalog’s BFS (or heuristic) strategy wouldn’t work with an SMT solver’s push/pop (i.e., DFS) assertion stack—but a few implementation tricks and <code>check-sat-assuming</code> indeed provide speedups.</p>

<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>

<p>Ok, I want to preface this article by stating that it is entirely anecdotal and based on my experience working as a doctor in the emergency room of one of the big hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden, and of living as a citizen in Sweden. As many people know, Sweden is perhaps the country that has taken the most relaxed attitude of any towards the covid pandemic. Unlike other countries, Sweden never went in to complete lockdown. Non-essential businesses have remained open, people have continued to go to cafés and restaurants, children have remained in school, and very few people have bothered with face masks in public.</p>



<p>Covid hit Stockholm like a storm in mid-March. One day I was seeing people with appendicitis and kidney stones, the usual things you see in the emergency room. The next day all those patients were gone and the only thing coming in to the hospital was covid. Practically everyone who was tested had covid, regardless of what the presenting symtom was. People came in with a nose bleed and they had covid. They came in with stomach pain and they had covid.</p>



<p>Then, after a few months, all the covid patients disappeared. It is now four months since the start of the pandemic, and I haven’t seen a single covid patient in over a month. When I do test someone because they have a cough or a fever, the test invariably comes back negative. At the peak three months back, a hundred people were dying a day of covid in Sweden, a country with a population of ten million. We are now down to around five people dying per day in the whole country, and that number continues to drop. Since people generally die around three weeks after infection, that means virtually no-one is getting infected any more. If we assume around 0.5 percent of those infected die (which I think is very generous, more on that later), then that means that three weeks back 1,000 people were getting infected per day in the whole country, which works out to a daily risk per person of getting infected of 1 in 10,000, which is miniscule. And remember, the risk of dying is at the very most 1 in 200 if you actually do get infected. And that was three weeks ago. Basically, covid is in all practical senses over and done with in Sweden. After four months.</p>



<p>In total covid has killed under 6,000 people in a country of ten million. A country with an annual death rate of around 100,000 people. Considering that 70% of those who have died of covid are over 80 years old, quite a few of those 6,000 would have died this year anyway. That makes covid a mere blip in terms of its effect on mortality.</p>



<p>That is why it is nonsensical to compare covid to other major pandemics, like the 1918 pandemic that killed tens of millions of people. Covid will never even come close to those numbers. And yet many countries have shut down their entire economies, stopped children going to school, and made large portions of their population unemployed in order to deal with this disease.</p>



<p>The media have been proclaiming that only a small percentage of the population have antibodies, and therefore it is impossible that herd immunity has developed. Well, if herd immunity hasn’t developed, where are all the sick people? Why has the rate of infection dropped so precipitously? Considering that most people in Sweden are leading their lives normally now, not socially distancing, not wearing masks, there should still be high rates of infection.</p>



<p>The reason we test for antibodies is because it is easy and cheap. Antibodies are in fact not the body’s main defence against virus infections. T-cells are. But T-cells are harder to measure than antibodies, so we don’t really do it clinically. It is quite possible to have T-cells that are specific for covid and thereby make you immune to the disease, without having any antibodies. Personally, I think this is what has happened. Everybody who works in the emergency room where I work has had the antibody test. Very few actually have antibodies. This is in spite of being exposed to huge numbers of infected people, including at the beginning of the pandemic, before we realized how widespread covid was, when no-one was wearing protective equipment.</p>



<p>I am not denying that covid is awful for the people who do get really sick or for the families of the people who die, just as it is awful for the families of people who die of cancer, or influenza, or an opioid overdose. But the size of the response in most of the world (not including Sweden) has been totally disproportionate to the size of the threat.</p>



<p>Sweden ripped the metaphorical band-aid off quickly and got the epidemic over and done with in a short amount of time, while the rest of the world has chosen to try to peel the band-aid off slowly. At present that means Sweden has one of the highest total death rates in the world. But covid is over in Sweden. People have gone back to their normal lives and barely anyone is getting infected any more. I am willing to bet that the countries that have shut down completely will see rates spike when they open up. If that is the case, then there won’t have been any point in shutting down in the first place, because all those countries are going to end up with the same number of dead at the end of the day anyway. Shutting down completely in order to decrease the total number of deaths only makes sense if you are willing to stay shut down until a vaccine is available. That could take years. No country is willing to wait that long.</p>



<p>Covid has at present killed less than 6000 in Sweden. It is very unlikely that the number of dead will go above 7,000. An average influenza year in Sweden, 700 people die of influenza. Does that mean covid is ten times worse than influenza? No, because influenza has been around for centuries while covid is completely new. In an average influenza year most people already have some level of immunity because they’ve been infected with a similar strain previously, or because they’re vaccinated. So it is quite possible, in fact likely, that the case fatality rate for covid is the same as for influenza, or only slightly higher, and the entire difference we have seen is due to the complete lack of any immunity in the population at the start of this pandemic. </p>



<p>This conclusion makes sense of the Swedish fatality numbers – if we’ve reached a point where there is hardly any active infection going on any more in Sweden in spite of the fact that there is barely any social distancing happening then that means at least 50% of the population has been infected already and have developed immunity, which is five million people. This number is perfectly reasonable if we assume a reproductive number for the virus of two: If each person infects two new, with a five day period between being infected and infecting others, and you start out with just one infected person in the country, then you will reach a point where several million are infected in just four months. If only 6000 are dead out of five million infected, that works out to a case fatality rate of 0.12 percent, roughly the same as regular old influenza, which no-one is the least bit frightened of, and which we don’t shut down our societies for.</p>

			I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden. Every day I get asked questions by my patients about health, diet, exercise, supplements, and medications. There is a lot of misinformation on the internet and it is easy to get the wrong advice, and hard to tell what is right and what is wrong if you don’t have advanced scientific training. The purpose of this blog is to share what the science actually says.			<a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/author/doctorsebastian/" rel="author">

<p>by Bill Atkinson, as told to Leo Laporte</p>
<p>In 1985 I swallowed a tiny fleck of gelatin containing a medium dose of LSD, and I spent most of the night sitting on a concrete park bench outside my home in Los Gatos, California.</p>

<p>I gazed up at a hundred billion galaxies each with a hundred billion stars, and each star a giant thermonuclear fusion reaction as powerful as our Sun. And for the first time in my life I knew deep down inside that we are not alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I knew that life on planet Earth is not the only pocket of consciousness in the universe, and likely not the most advanced. But we still have a role to play in the unfolding drama of creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed to me the universe is in a process of coming alive. Consciousness is blossoming and propagating to colonize the universe, and life on Earth is one of many bright spots in the cosmic birth of consciousness.</p>

<p>But the stars are separated by enormous distances of darkness and vacuum, which may hinder communication between them. I lowered my gaze and saw the street lamps below glowing brightly, each casting a pool of light but surrounded by darkness before the next lamp. As above, so below.</p>

<p>The street lamps reminded me of bodies of knowledge, gems of discovery and understanding, but separated from each other by distance and different languages. Poets, artists, musicians, physicists, chemists, biologists, mathmeticians, and economists all have separate pools of knowledge, but are hindered from sharing and finding the deeper connections.</p>

<p>My vision distorted by thick eyeglasses, I witnessed the curvature of the Earth’s horizon, and I felt the pull of gravity toward its center, such that every one of us is standing at the very apex. Each of us stands at the top of planet Earth, and each of us is a leader or captain of the “Blue Marble” team.</p>

<p>How could I help? By focusing on the weak link. If I were captain of a soccer team, I would look for the weak link and work on it. If the goalie was letting too many through, I would spend extra practice time with him, and the whole team would prosper.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the weak link for the Blue Marble team is wisdom. Humanity has achieved sufficient technological power to change the course of life and the entire global ecosystem, but we seem to lack the perspective to choose wisely between alternative futures. But I was young, without much life experience or wisdom myself.</p>

<p>Knowledge, it seemed to me, consists of the “How” connections between pieces of information, the cause and effect relationships. How does this action bring about that result. Science is a systematic attempt to discover the “How” connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wisdom, it seemed to me, was a step further removed, the bigger perspective of the “Why” connections between pieces of knowledge. Why, for reasons ethical and aesthetic, should we choose one future over another?</p>

<p>I thought if we could encourage sharing of ideas between different areas of knowledge, perhaps more of the bigger picture would emerge, and eventually more wisdom might develop. Sort of a trickle-up theory of information leading to knowledge leading to wisdom.</p>

<p>This was the underlying inspiration for HyperCard, a multimedia authoring environment that empowered non-programmers to share ideas using new interactive media called HyperCard stacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each card in a HyperCard stack included graphics, text, interactive buttons, and links that took you to another card or stack. Built-in painting tools, drag-and-drop authoring with a library of pre-fab buttons and fields, and simple event based scripting made HyperCard flexible and easy to use.</p>

<p>It took a lot of hard work and a dedicated team to complete this mission. Apple shipped HyperCard in August 1987, and included it free with every Mac so any user could create and share HyperCard stacks. Many creative people expressed their ideas and passions, and several million interactive HyperCard stacks were created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HyperCard was a precurser to the first web browser, except chained to a hard drive before the worldwide web. Six years later Mosaic was introduced, influenced by some of the ideas in HyperCard, and indirectly by an inspiring LSD experience.</p>

<p>
We have talked a fair <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/what-is-mrna-vaccine.html">amount</a> <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/antibody-hope-in-sars-cov-2.html">about</a> antibodies, and much of the SARS-CoV-2 discussion is focused on antibodies as indicators, treatments, or vaccines. However, antibodies produced by B-cells are only one part of the larger immune picture, albeit one of the most accessible parts. To develop a comprehensive treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2, we will likely need to understand how the broader network of immune cells responds to the virus. Today, we’ll take a closer look at the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and what it says about long-term immunity.
</p>
<h3>A robust T cell response</h3>


<p>
A brief refresher: T cells, <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/adaptive-immune-cells.html">you may remember</a>, are adaptive immune cells. Each T cell has a unique T cell receptor that recognizes a different set of foreign peptides, and if a T cell’s receptor is activated, that T cell clones itself and produces an army of similar T cells capable of fighting off the invader that was recognized. T cells come in several varieties, the two most prominent of which are CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are responsible for surveying peptides (that is, short protein fragments) presented by antigen-presenting cells like B cells and macrophages and starting a signaling cascade that activates the rest of the immune system, and are thus referred to as “helper” T cells. CD8+ T cells survey peptides presented by normal tissue cells throughout the body, and, if they recognize one of the presented peptides as foreign, they kill the cell under the assumption that it has been infected. CD8+ T cells are thus called “killer” T cells.</p><p><img height="441" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VHihcE0ie5EooWOw2mc8MzfuYgaOlru5R7lLNl22U_DTENRS9eBrKdPNZd1a0q609Hhyl7WZLuQpw8lVU3fO2ZsWAYwdT_anu_JpkUAMOyP1IkBQ_TGsvrYS4geTdOtRC1TVjQLU=w499-h441" width="499"></p><p>Given these critical roles in immune system activation, scientists are studying the extent to which CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize peptides from SARS-CoV-2. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">one recent paper</a>, Grifoni et al. created pools of peptides that tile the entire set of proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2. In one pool, they created a peptide for every set of 15 amino acids from the Spike protein, tiled such that each length-15 chain overlapped by ten amino acids with the next peptide in the pool. In another pool, they computationally predicted which peptides would be efficiently held by antigen presenting cells like macrophages, and made peptides that covered the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A similar pool was made for the peptides predicted to be efficiently held in the MHC class I molecules that CD8+ T cells recognize.</p> <p><img height="250" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zUoM8PrduU9w1Tw6QW9QYVvR_PE7ctTnUvJyqoBkLcEO6jqFuuZwkc97g5hStxr7hNOl4ceN3bcB4PBHx0GrHLioF1cOAWLW9-eK3K7Xk6U_rw-ZTmx9oj5FiyisoABi1VRZ7fYv" width="241"></p><p>
Scientists regularly create overlapping peptides that tile proteins of interest when studying which pieces of a protein immune cells recognize. This is a generic example showing overlap strategies from Mimotopes.com, a company that creates and sells custom peptides.
</p>
<p>
To test out the effects of these peptide pools, the researchers collected blood from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, 20 - 35 days after symptom onset. The researchers extracted the Peripheral Mononuclear Blood Cells (PBMCs) from the blood, as these include circulating T cells and other immune cells, and then ran a series of experiments to see how the T cells responded to the peptide pools. The number of patients was small (20 patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 20 unexposed controls), but even so, the results were consistent: all recovered COVID-19 patients showed evidence of a robust T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. 100% of patients had CD4+ T cells that recognized and became activated in response to peptides from the Spike pool as well as peptides from the non-Spike peptide pool. These activated cells were able to produce inflammatory cytokines (immune signaling molecules) and to quickly clone themselves. The response of the patients’ CD8+ T cells was less universal, but still robust: 70% of patients had CD8+ T cells that were activated in response to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. 
</p>
<h3>Memories of infections past</h3>


<p>
What does this T cell response mean? For starters, it indicates that recovered COVID-19 patients have a stronghold of “memory” T cells— T cells that have seen SARS-CoV-2 and learned its patterns so that they are ready to respond more quickly in the future. It’s unclear whether these T cells are able to confer long-term immunity for the patients, but there is some evidence that they might: another paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">Le Bert et al.</a> ran a similar set of peptide/T cell experiments, but they were able to include a set of long-recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients. They found that even after 17 years, these patients had T cells that were able to quickly respond to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, which gives us hope that T cell memory of SARS-CoV-2 will be similarly long-lived.
</p>
<p>
These cross-reactive T cells were not limited to SARS-CoV-1 patients, either. Both Grifoni et al. and Le Bert et al. used PBMCs drawn from donors without any exposure to COVID as controls, but these unexposed controls proved more interesting than the “zero baseline” we might have expected, as up to 50% of the unexposed controls showed some degree of reactivity to peptides from SARS-CoV-2, though these reactions were skewed toward the non-spike peptide pools. The researchers reason this is likely due to previous exposure to coronaviruses that cause common colds, and indeed, all unexposed controls had antibodies for two common coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. If true, this cross-reactivity between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 could explain some of the variability in severity of COVID-19 across different people; some immune systems may already be primed to react to SARS-CoV-2 by prior infections. Further, given that the cross-reactive responses were more pronounced for non-spike proteins, this finding lends support to the idea that we should have a multi-target approach to vaccination and treatment, rather than a Spike-only approach.
</p>
<p>
(We should pause for a moment here to address a nagging question: wait, if even the unexposed controls showed responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, how do we know any of these responses are real? Isn’t the whole idea of a control to give a baseline to compare to? There are several reasons to believe these results are legitimate: peptide assays are fairly robust in immunological studies; the amplitude and targets of the control response are distinct from the COVID-19-exposed response; and multiple studies from multiple labs found the same results with the same peculiarities. That said, the sample size is very small, and the lack of a non-reactive control should always be concerning, so more studies in this area should be conducted before we draw any strong conclusions here.)
</p>

<p>
COVID-19-exposed cells (top row) showed a robust response to a number of SARS-CoV-2 targets, but the unexposed controls also showed some responsiveness, especially among lesser-known viral peptides.
</p>
<h3>Reading the T leaves</h3>


<p>
Taken all together, these T cell experiments demonstrate that, well, T cells matter, too. A robust immune response requires many cells, and the evidence of consistent T cell activation in recovered patients indicates that T cells play an important role in the natural clearance of the virus. It stands to reason, then, that an effective vaccination strategy will likely have to consider how and when to activate T cells. These studies identify a number of distinct peptides that activate T cells across patients, and could therefore be used along with antibodies as part of a vaccination strategy.

<p>Last time I have <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/08/02/post_juliacon_1.html">posted</a> about the take-aways for DataFrames.jl from
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. This time I wanted to share my general conclusions
from attending different talks at this extremely successful event.</p>

<p>I have spent 20 years now deploying data science related projects in corporate
environments (back then it was not called data science, but we were already
training neural networks to make predictions) and have many colleagues who are
deeply into enterprise software development. Quoting a discussion with
Tomasz Olczak I had some time ago, who is a genuine one-man army in
delivering complex enterprise projects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia is fast, and has a very nice syntax, but its ecosystem is not mature
enough for use in serious production projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For many years I would agree with it, but after <a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>
I believe we can confidently announce that</p>

<p>
  <b><i>Julia is production ready!</i></b>
</p>

<p>Let me now give a list of key (in my opinion) presentations given during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a> that make me draw this conclusion.</p>

<p>I will not comment here on functionalities related to number crunching, as it
is clear that Julia shines here, but rather I want to focus on the things that
make Julia a great tool for deployment in production (still I skip many
interesting talks in this area — check out the detailed <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/agenda/">agenda</a> to
learn more).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y3H7FG">this talk</a> <a href="https://github.com/quinnj">Jacob Quinn</a> gives an end to end tutorial how
to build and deploy in an enterprise setting a microservice using Julia.
He gives ready recipes how to solve typical tasks that need to be handled in
such contexts: logging, context management, middleware setup, authentication,
caching, connection pooling, dockerization, and many other, that
are bread and butter of enterprise projects.</p>

<p>As an addition be sure to check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Z8TE39">shippable apps</a> talk, where <a href="https://github.com/KristofferC">Kristoffer Carlsson</a> guides you
through creating executables which can be run on machines that do not have Julia
installed.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/N39HSX">Julia for scripting</a> presentation, during which
<a href="https://github.com/fredrikekre">Fredrik Ekre</a> discusses the best practices for using Julia in contexts
where you need to execute short code snippets many times.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DTLBM9">Genie.jl</a> talk, in which <a href="https://github.com/essenciary">Adrian Salceanu</a> shows that it is currently
a mature, stable, performant, and feature-rich Julia web development framework.</li>
</ul>



<p>The two talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PLFURQ">Pkg.update()</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/RXAN8F">What’s new in Pkg</a> show that
currently Julia has best in class functionalities for enterprise grade dependency
management for your projects. The list of provided functionalities is so long
that it is hard to list them all here.</p>

<p>Let me just mention one particular tool in this ecosystem, that is presented in
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/9WMAVU">BinaryBuilder.jl</a> talk that explains how to take software written in compiled
languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Go or Rust, and build precompiled artifacts
that can be used from Julia packages with ease (which means that no compilation
has to take place on client side when you install packages having such dependencies).</p>



<p>A natural topic related to dependency management is how to integrate Julia with
external tools. This area of functionality is really mature. Here is a list of
talks that cover this topic:</p>

<p>Here it is worth to add Julia has had a great integration with Python for many
years now, see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy">JuliaPy</a>.</p>

<p>A good end to end example of doing some real work in Julia that requires integration
is <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/KK9S9V">Creating a multichannel wireless speaker setup with Julia</a>
talk that show how to easily stitch things together (and in particular featuring
ZMQ.jl, Opus.jl, PortAudio.jl, and DSP.jl).</p>

<p>Another interesting talk showcasing integration capabilities is
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/GFE3DB">JSServe: Websites &amp; Dashboards in Julia</a>
that shows a high performance framework to easily combine interactive plots,
markdown, widgets and plain HTML/Javascript in Jupyter / Atom / Nextjournal and
on websites.</p>



<p>The two great talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DWCJUK">Juno 1.0</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HBTFT7">Using VS Code</a> that current IDE
support for Julia in VS Code is first class. You have all tools that normally you
would expect to get: code analysis (static and dynamic), debugger, workspaces,
integration with Jupyter Notebooks, and remote capabilities.</p>



<p>I do not want to cover many different ML algorithms that are available in Julia
natively, as there are just too many of them (and if something is missing you
can easily integrate it — see the integration capabilities section above).</p>

<p>However, on top of particular models you need frameworks that let you manage
ML workflows. In this area there are two interesting talks, one about
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DMHZCC">MLJ: a machine learning toolbox for Julia</a> and the other showing
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/AD7TQW">AutoMLPipeline: A ToolBox for Building ML Pipelines</a>. From my experience
such tools are crucial when you want to move with your ML models from data scientist’s
sandbox to a real production usage.</p>



<p>Obviously, I have omitted many interesting things that were shown during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. However, I hope that the aspects I have covered here,
that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enterprise grade patterns to create microservices and applications in Julia,</li>
  <li>robust dependency management tools,</li>
  <li>very flexible and powerful capabilities to integrate Julia with existing code
bases that were not written in Julia,</li>
  <li>excellent developer tooling in VSCode,</li>
  <li>mature packages that help you to create production-grade code for ML solutions
deployment,</li>
</ul>

<p>show that already now Julia can (and should) be considered as a serious option
for your next project in enterprise environment.</p>

<p>What I believe is crucially important is that not only we have required tools
ready but also we have great practical showcases how they can be used to build
robust production code with.</p>

<p>The M/M/c model may not behave like you expect.</p>


<p>I have a system with <code>c</code> servers, each of which can only handle a single concurrent request, and has no internal queuing. The servers sit behind a load balancer, which contains an infinite queue. An unlimited number of clients offer <code>c * 0.8</code> requests per second to the load balancer on average. In other words, we increase the offered load linearly with <code>c</code> to keep the per-server load constant. Once a request arrives at a server, it takes one second to process, on average. How does the client-observed mean request time vary with <code>c</code>?</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_plot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Option A is that the mean latency decreases quickly, asymptotically approaching one second as <code>c</code> increases (in other words, the time spent in queue approaches zero). Option B is constant. Option C is a linear improvement, and D is a linear degradation in latency. Which curve do you, intuitively, think that the latency will follow?</p>

<p>I asked my Twitter followers the same question, and got an interestingly mixed result:
<img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_twitter_poll.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Breaking down the problem a bit will help figure out which is the right answer. First, names. In the terminology of queue theory, this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/c_queue">M/M/c</a> queuing system: Poisson arrival process, exponentially distributed client service time, and <code>c</code> backend servers. In teletraffic engineering, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agner_Krarup_Erlang">Erlang's</a> delay system (or, because terminology is fun, M/M/n). We can use a classic result of queuing theory to analyze this system: Erlang's C formula <em>E<sub>2,n</sub>(A)</em>, which calculates the probability that an incoming customer request is enqueued (rather than handled immediately), based on the number of servers (<code>n</code> aka <code>c</code>), and the offered traffic <code>A</code>. For the details, see page 194 of the <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/stg/D-STG-SG02.16.1-2001-PDF-E.pdf">Teletraffic Engineering Handbook</a>. Here's the basic shape of the curve (using our same parameters):</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Follow the blue line up to half the saturation point, at 2.5 rps offered load, and see how the probability is around 13%. Now look at the purple line at half its saturation point, at 5 rps. Just 3.6%. So at half load the 5-server system is handling 87% of traffic without queuing, with double the load and double the servers, we handle 96.4% without queuing. Which means only 3.6% see any additional latency.</p>

<p>It turns out this improvement is, indeed, asymptotically approaching 1. The right answer to the Twitter poll is A.</p>

<p>Using the mean to measure latency is controversial (although <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">perhaps it shouldn't be</a>). To avoid that controversy, we need to know whether the percentiles get better at the same rate. Doing that in closed form is somewhat complicated, but this system is super simple, so we can plot them out using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The results look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/sim_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That's entirely good news. The median (p50) follows the mean line nicely, and the high percentiles (99<sup>th</sup> and 99.9<sup>th</sup>) have a similar shape. No hidden problems.</p>

<p>It's also good news for cloud and service economics. With larger <code>c</code> we get better latency at the same utilization, or better utilization for the same latency, all at the same per-server throughput. That's not good news only for giant services, because most of this goodness happens at relatively modest <code>c</code>. There are few problems related to scale and distributed systems that get easier as <code>c</code> increases. This is one of them.</p>

<p>There are some reasonable follow-up questions. Are the results robust to our arbitrary choice of 0.8? Yes, they are<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. Are the M/M/c assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponential service time reasonable for typical services? I'd say they are reasonable, albeit wrong. Exponential service time is especially wrong: realistic services tend to be something more like log-normal. It may not matter. More on that another time.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Dan Ports responded to my thread with a fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/danrkports/status/1291517540280070144">Twitter thread</a> pointing to <a href="https://drkp.net/papers/latency-socc14.pdf">Tales of the Tail: Hardware, OS, and Application-level Sources of Tail Latency</a> from SoCC'14 which looks at this effect in the wild.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> Up to a point. As soon as the mean arrival rate exceeds the system's ability to complete requests, the queue grows without bound and latency goes to infinity. In our case, that happens when the request load exceeds <code>c</code>. More generally, for this system to be stable <code>λ/cμ</code> must be less than 1, where <code>λ</code> is the mean arrival rate, and <code>μ</code> is the mean time taken for a server to process a request.</li>

<h3>I made a mechanical keyboard with 3d-printed switches</h3>
<p><i>Fri  7 August 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/3dprinting.html">3dprinting</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">keyboard</a></i></p>
<p>The keyboard is done! This is basically the result of what I've been working on for the past 2 months, which has
involved 3 iterations of testing machines, over 100 printed switches, and now finally a keyboard that I can type on.
Unfortunately it is not a very good keyboard, but you can't win them all.</p>
<p>Here's some pictures of the keyboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2843"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2843"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2844"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2844"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"></a></p>
<p>And here's a video of me typing on it:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iEBbCk1WJUk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>(In the video it is a bit wobbly because the back is propped up to take the pressure off the exposed wiring. I have subsequently printed a couple of small legs to raise up
the back of the keyboard and now it is a lot <i>less</i> wobbly, but it could still do with some soft feet).</p>
<p>I am very happy with how the keyboard looks, and also happy that I have managed to produce a working keyboard using 3d-printed switches in the first place. I believe
this may be a world first.</p>
<p>That said, I started using the jesboard to write this blog post, and it was too annoying to type on so I went back to the Filco. Spending some time typing
on my homemade switches has given me a newfound appreciation for just how good Cherry MX switches are. I'm not sure what it is that makes the
jesboard so unpleasant to type on, there's just a general vagueness to it that makes typing frustrating. Pressing a single key up and down feels basically fine, which is why I hadn't
noticed this problem while developing the switches. But trying to use it as an actual keyboard, and type at a sensible speed, just feels <i>really</i> bad. It
is genuinely the worst keyboard I have ever used. So that's disappointing.</p>
<p>I think to improve upon this you'd probably want to reduce the activation force (that's easy, just make the spring thinner) and add some tactile feedback so it is easier to tell
when the switch has actually been pressed. Beyond that, I'm not sure.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"></a></p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the switches, I would recommend looking at some of my other <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">posts tagged "keyboard"</a>, but in short:
pressing on the stem at the top compresses the spiral spring (I copied the spring design from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSsm4h2ccJMdR6bsAFyIu6A">Riskable 3D Printing</a>, he
is also developing 3d-printable keyboard switches, but using magnet sensors instead of making mechanical switches himself). Once
the stem is pressed down far enough, a contact wire bridges the 2 contacts at the bottom, activating the switch. As the switch is pressed further, the leaf spring compresses, allowing
the stem to move further down while allowing the contact wire to remain in place. Eventually the spiral spring bottoms out against its casing and then stem movement stops. When the key is released,
the spiral spring pushes everything back up to the top.</p>
<p>The leaf spring has a section in its bend that is narrow in the "other" axis, to allow it easily tilt side-to-side to ensure good contact with both of the contact wires.</p>
<p>I don't have a good photo of the latest switch design, but I have this of an earlier version:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"></a></p>
<p>The working principle is the same but the new version is a bit shorter.</p>
<p>The switches are printed in PETG. If you want to see them in action, you might enjoy my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBQBf6jzFM">video of operating the switch tester</a>.
The final incarnation of the switch design lasted over 350k presses in all cases, and some instances still hadn't failed at 500k presses. This is a lot lower than the "tens of millions" that might be
expected of a commercial switch, but it's a big improvement over <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-failure.html">13907</a> which is where the first iteration failed, and that was on an extremely
gentle machine.</p>
<p>I said I was going to experiment with moving the activation point down to 75% of the plunger travel so as to reduce the strain on
the leaf spring. I did test this on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/another-new-tester.html">new machine</a>, with 5 of the old design and 5 of the new design side-by-side, and the new design lasted almost
twice as long, so that was a good improvement.</p>
<p>The gold-plated "jewellery wire" that I bought off eBay ended up working well and soldering well (so I conclude it was not varnished),
and 4 metres (costing £4) was <i>just</i> enough to do the entire keyboard.</p>
<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/3dpswitch.tar.gz">download the switch CAD</a>, including STL and FreeCAD files.</p>
<h2>Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"></a></p>
<p>The case is split into 2 halves that are then glued together, so that it fits on the bed of the 3D printer. There is a large rectangular hole at the top and bottom in each half, and a long bit of plastic
inside joining them, to add a bit more strength to the joint. There's not a lot to the case design really, it is just a shape to fit the switches into,
with a bulge at the top to house the microcontroller, an exit hole for the cable, stabiliser mounts, and a cool-looking logo. I made the general shape of the case halves in FreeCAD, and then imported the resulting STL
into OpenSCAD to cut out the holes for the switches, because I found it easier to get the layout correct with code.</p>
<p>I printed the logo in a different colour by having the printer stop and wait for me to change the filament at the layer height where the colour changes, using the
<a href="https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M600.html">M600</a> G-code command. PrusaSlicer has a nice GUI for setting this up, so I didn't even need to manually edit the G-code.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"></a></p>
<p>If I were to make another keyboard, I would give myself more space to work with underneath by reducing the thickness of the "solid" middle part that the switches are mounted in.
I found that there was not really enough room to run the diodes and wires. I would also add provision for a few screws to attach a bottom cover to protect the wiring inside.</p>
<p>The case and keycaps are printed in Prusament Galaxy Black PLA, which I think gives a really nice finish.</p>
<h2>Keycaps</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"></a></p>
<p>The keycaps were designed using <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2">KeyV2</a>, a free parametric keycap library for OpenSCAD. If you want to design
some keycaps, you should check out KeyV2. Its creator, <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii">Bob</a>, is friendly and gave me helpful advice and assistance.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to make an ISO (UK-style) enter key in KeyV2, but I couldn't find any combination of settings that would let me have rounded corners, sloping top,
and dished top, so I ended up making the enter key by hand in FreeCAD.</p>
<p>I was originally going to use "outset" legends on the keycaps, like I used on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/3pct-keyboard.html">macro keypad</a>. But I read this comment in the KeyV2 source
which changed my mind, so I used inset legends instead:</p>
<pre><code>// make legends outset instead of inset.
// broken off from artisan support since who wants outset legends?
$outset_legends = false;</code></pre>
<p>But having printed all the keycaps, I'm not sure whether I think inset legends actually <i>are</i> better. They range from "perfectly fine" to "almost invisible" depending on the lighting. I'd
say the outset legends were easier to read.</p>
<h2>Wiring</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"></a></p>
<p>The switches are hand-wired in a 15x5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_matrix_circuit">keyboard matrix</a>, with diodes allowing current to pass only in one direction. 14x5 would be enough
if you thought about it a bit more than I did, but 15x5 is fine.</p>
<p>Originally I was planning to use an Arduino for the microcontroller, which has only 16 IO pins. This would allow for an 8x8 matrix, but when I went to layout the wiring, I came up with this, where
red is columns and green is rows:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"></a></p>
<p>Obviously this is too complicated to wire up in real life, particularly in the small amount of space provided in the bottom of my case. You may also notice it was too complicated for me to
lay out in GIMP, as I have failed to connect the full-stop and apostophe keys to any row. For these reasons I decided to use a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> 2.0 instead, which allowed me to use a more sensible matrix layout:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"></a></p>
<p>(I laid this out on <a href="https://kbfirmware.com/">kbfirmware.com</a>).</p>
<p>The other part of the wiring is that the USB cable has to reach the microcontroller. I left a 4mm hole in the side of the case for the cable to run through, but this is too small for the connector
on the end. I was originally planning to cut the connector off and solder the wires directly to the USB pads on the micocontroller board, but they were too small and annoying to access, so instead
I just soldered the MiniUSB end back on and plugged it in. It's a tight fit but it does the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"></a></p>
<p>In hindsight, I am not sure whether I regret hand-wiring the keyboard. I toyed with the idea of getting a PCB made up that I could directly solder my switches to. It would certainly have
made it easier to put the keyboard together, but I thought outsourcing the manufacturing of a PCB kind of takes the edge off making your own switches...</p>
<h2>Stabilisers</h2>
<p>Here's a clip showing how the stabilisers work:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTvDP3Qutwk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The idea is that when you press down on one side you cause the bar to rotate, which then pulls down on the other side of the switch, forcing the key to move down parallel (instead of rocking)
and activate the switch properly. The bar is made of 1.75mm stainless steel wire bent into a suitable shape. Thick stainless wire is quite hard to cut, but doable with a big-ish pair of nippers.</p>
<p>While trying to fit the stabilisers for the spacebar, I managed to break off the mounts attached to the case. This is bad news because the case halves are about a 10-hour print each, and aside from
that I had already soldered up all of the switches. To reprint the case halves would involve undoing all of my soldering work, and then 20 hours of printing, and then redoing all of the soldering.</p>
<p>I wasn't interested in redoing all of that work, so as a last resort I drilled a hole into the case in the position of each stabiliser mount, and printed 2 new stabiliser mounts, long enough to fit
in the holes. I printed the mounts in PETG so that they'd be less likely to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2842"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2842"></a></p>
<p>This worked really well, disaster averted! The mounts were a tight fit in the drilled holes so I didn't even need to use any glue.</p>
<h2>QMK</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> for the keyboard firmware, running on a Teensy 2.0. I found it quite hard to get started with my custom keyboard, because almost all of the documentation
is geared towards the case where you are using an off-the-shelf keyboard which is already defined in QMK. The key point I needed to know was that you can use the script "<tt>./util/new_keyboard.s…</tt></p></div></div>

<p>If you would like to follow along with the latest design or would like to dive deep into the internals of <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> we have created a repository on <a href="https://github.com/PopcornComputer/PocketPC-Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a> for the latest hardware files. The work is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>We are one step closer to shipping Pocket P.C. with the latest developments.</strong></h3>



<p>The latest D.V.T PCB design is out for production. We expect the PCBs to arrive within 10-12 days.&nbsp; After that, we will be assembling 25 units.</p>



<p>The D.V.T. design brings with it a newly added SPI Flash which will allow <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>to more easily boot multiple operating systems on the same <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> We also changed the design to a 10-layer PCB stackup vs. 8-layers which will ensure better signal integrity for high-speed signals.</p>



<p>The keyboard layout has been tweaked incorporating feedback from community suggestions and from hands-on the 3D printed prototypes. Thank you to everyone who submitted feedback about our initial layout. The space bar has been extended to allow for it to be pressed from a comfortable hand position and a few other minor changes. You can view the latest layout in our community keyboard thread here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/pocket-p-c-keyboard-layout-part-2/541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. Keyboard Layout (Part 2)</a></p>



<p>We learned a lot from the last production run of Original Popcorn. We did not receive the level of support that we were promised from the USB-C IC manufacturer that we chose to handle the USB Power Delivery system. As such, we changed the <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> design to incorporate a robust Texas Instruments single-chip solution. With this new solution, we added to the design dedicated port protector ICs with ESD protection and surge protection ICs also from Texas Instruments on every ports. This will make the design more robust to faulty power conditions.</p>



<p>Finally, to ensure that <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>has great software support out of the box, we have requested embedded development help from the community. Our goal is to ensure that we get all aspects of our products mainlined so that custom kernels will not be required. In order to accomplish this, a community effort is required to review and test new solutions before submitting them to the Linux Kernel mailing list. If you are interested in following with our development efforts you can join the discussion here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/embedded-linux-development-help-requested/559/15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embedded Linux Development Help Requested</a></p>
