Its findings are limited because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.</p>  <p>Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.</p>  <p>"So we've now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That's the good news," he said. "That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1842141251676-metadata-" title="What scientists know about the new coronavirus variant"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/643/819/COVID-VARIANT-SCI-BIRAK-080121.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>The B1-17 coronavirus variant, first discovered in the U.K., is now in at least 40 countries, including Canada.

They have said they expect them to be effective, but the timing of those studies is not known.</p>  <p>A senior British lawmaker expressed concerns in an interview on Friday that COVID-19 vaccines might not work properly against the South African variant. He was not responding to questions about Friday's data.</p>  <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc., which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary.

        <h2>Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive</h2>
      </p>
      
        
      

      <div><p>Donald Trump loves to tweet and everyone knows that.
Twitter is his favorite medium to express his ideas and to communicate with the world.
He has been an active Twitter user since 2009. Much longer than many other world leaders.</p>
<p>Last month (May 2020) he tweeted 845 times â€” that's 28 tweets per day on average!</p>
<center>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/491324429184823296"><img src="https://pikaso.me/blog/files/pikaso.me-realDonaldTrump-20140721_205046-491324429184823296.png" alt="Trump Tweet" width="500" height="244"></a>
</center>
<p>A while ago we received a request from one of our users who was looking for a way to screenshot all Donald Trump tweets.
We realized that's a good opportunity to put <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a> into test and see if it can perform such a task without any problems.
It went smoothly and there was only an issue with one of his tweets which included a deleted image.</p>
<p>Today, we are releasing the resulting files to the public.
This archive contains screenshots of 43,475 Donald Trump tweets from May 2009 to May 2020.
Whether you are pro- or anti- Trump, this is an important part of Internet history that we believe should be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>The Donald Trump Twitter Screenshot Archive can be downloaded through the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.zip">trump_twitter_archive_v1.zip</a> (Direct download, 2.6 GB)</li>
<li><a href="https://pikaso.me/go/trump-twitter-archive-v1.torrent">trump_twitter_archive_v1.torrent</a> (Torrent download, 28.2 KB)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="howthiswasmade">How This Was Made?</h3>
<p>To create this archive, we first extracted all tweet ids from the realDonaldTrump.csv file that was provided to us.
That file only contained Donald Trump tweets up to March 29, 2020. To get the later tweets, we used <a href="http://trumptwitterarchive.com/">trumptwitterarchive.com</a>.</p>
<p>We then used the <a href="https://pikaso.me/api">Pikaso API</a> to screenshot each individual tweet.</p>
<h3 id="updates">Updates</h3>
<p>We have no plans to keep this archive up to date after the initial release.
However, if you are interested in doing so, you can use <a href="https://pikaso.me/">Pikaso</a>.
You can even <a href="https://pikaso.me/automate">automate</a> it so that each time he tweets, an automatic screenshot is taken.</p>

  <p><span>06 Jan 2021</span></p><p>With the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/" target="\_blank">Ruby 3.0 release</a>, there’s been a lot of chatter about concurrency, parallelism, and async IO.</p>

<p>For my own reflection, I wanted to write down what that means for performance and capacity/costs of apps, and what would be the impact on the Ruby ecosystem.</p>

<p>I will assume that the audience already knows the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Threads_vs._processes_pros_and_cons" target="\_blank">threads vs processes model in UNIX</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law" target="\_blank">Little’s law</a>.</p>

<p>
Updated on Jan 9, 2021: thanks to the feedback from <a href="https://github.com/ioquatix" target="_blank">Samuel Williams</a>, I’ve revised the post with findings from <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon" target="_blank">Falcon</a>, the async web server written in Ruby.</p>

<h2 id="learning-from-python">Learning from Python</h2>

<p>It’s always good to take learnings from other languages. There’s an excellent <a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html" target="\_blank">write-up “Async Python is not faster” by Cal Paterson</a>.</p>

<p>It argues that process-based (aka forking) web servers <strong>show better latencies for web requests</strong> when they are compared to async IO-powered servers.</p>

<p>But why? That’s because async IO brings co-operative scheduling, which means that the execution is only yielded upon language keywords like <code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Quoting the author, this means that execution time is not distributed “fairly” and one thread can inadvertently starve another of CPU time while it is working. This is why latency is more erratic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast, traditional sync webservers use the pre-emptive multi-processing of the kernel scheduler, which works to ensure fairness by periodically swapping processes out from execution. This means that time is divided more fairly and that latency variance is lower.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="learning-from-falcon">Learning from Falcon</h2>

<p>
(added on Jan 9, 2021)
</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon">Falcon</a> is a multi-process, multi-fiber HTTP server written in Ruby that is already utilizing async IO.</p>

<p>It has a great <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon-benchmark">set of benchmarks</a> that let us compare Falcon’s async IO with other non-async web servers like Passenger, Puma and Unicorn. Those benchmarks have been showing that <strong>async IO-powered server like Falcon</strong> provides better latencies on web requests.</p>

<p>Interestingly, that’s a very different story than Python! Looking at Python, I’ve expected that the thread driven server should be more “balanced” but it turns out the opposite.</p>

<p>Falcon’s authors explain that the fiber scheduler naturally scales according to load much better than the worker pool implementation in Puma. When fibers are busy handling requests, they don’t call <code>accept</code> so the requests are naturally picked up by other workers who are less busy.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-mean-for-us-ruby-developers">What does that mean for us Ruby developers?</h3>

<p>Scheduling threads and fibers is nuanced, and you can see that similar approaches demonstrate different results on Python and Ruby/Falcon examples.</p>

<p>In the first revision of this post, I’ve argued that async IO may often increase the latency. Thanks to the data <a href="https://github.com/socketry/falcon-benchmark">shown</a> by Samuel Williams, we can see that’s not the case.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of async IO is that concurrency is archived by the <code>yield</code>/<code>await</code> instruction, not by the constant interrupt of threads. Every interrupt causes the context switch - and it’s nice to reduce context switching where we can because scheduler switching from one task to another always adds a little overhead. Since that happens thousands of times every second, <strong>less context switching would mean fewer CPU cycles wasted</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-ractor-fit-in">Where does Ractor fit in?</h2>

<p>The Ractor pattern allows parallel execution (which wasn’t possible in Ruby before) of more than one Ruby thread by limiting the shared state of a block of code that you want to execute in parallel. Those “blocks of code” (aka “actors”) can also talk to each other through messages. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor model</a> used in other languages.</p>

<p>There are two ways we could leverage Ractors for modern apps: from the top (wrap every worker into a Ractor) and from the bottom (selectively use Ractors within existing code to parallelize CPU-intensive work).</p>

<p>While I see more to be gained from the top way, it seems like there’s so much shared and mutable state in Ruby libraries that it’s going to be quite tricky, although not impossible. It will likely take some efforts and at least a year of work from the community to push libraries towards less shared state. For the next year, we’ll mostly see Ractor maturing and getting adopted in the “bottom” use cases.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-ruby-ecosystem">Impact on the Ruby ecosystem</h2>

<p><strong>By itself, async IO will help to use CPU more efficiently by reducing context switching.</strong></p>

<p>Better support for async IO in Ruby 3.0 will increase community’s adoption of async web servers like Falcon, and will hopefully give birth to async background job systems.</p>

<p>Having Sidekiq execute jobs concurrently through the async IO and event loop instead of threads could increase the throughput and save CPU work, especially for IO-bound workloads like webhook delivery.</p>

<p><strong>We’ll need to push the Ruby ecosystem to have less shared state to fully leverage the Ractor pattern.</strong> That will take us some time.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed reading this, I highly recommend to read <em><a href="http://wjwh.eu/posts/2020-12-28-ruby-fiber-scheduler-c-extension.html" target="\_blank">Ruby 3.0 and the new FiberScheduler interface</a></em> by Wander Hillen.</p>

<p>Thanks to Samiel Williams and to Julik Tarkhanov for providing early feedback on this post.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this in the comments!</p>

						<p><a href="https://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-1/">Last time</a> we formulated the problem of isosurface extraction and discussed some general approaches at a high level.&nbsp; Today, we’re going to get very specific and look at meshing in particular.</p>
<p>For the sake of concreteness, let us suppose that we have approximated our potential field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" title="f"> by sampling it onto a cubical grid at some fixed resolution.&nbsp; To get intermediate values, we’ll just interpolate between grid points using the standard <a href="http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/interpolation/">trilinear interpolation</a>.&nbsp; This is like a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C^0" title="C^0"> generalization of Minecraft-style voxel surfaces.&nbsp; Our goal in this article is to figure out how to extract a mesh of the implicit surface (or zero-crossings of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" title="f">).&nbsp; In particular, we’re going to look at three different approaches to this problem:</p>
<h2>Marching Cubes</h2>
<p>By far the most famous method for extracting isosurfaces is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">marching cubes</a> algorithm. &nbsp;In fact, it is so popular that the term `marching cubes’ is even more popular than the term `isosurface’ (at least according to Google)!&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s quite a feat when an algorithm becomes more popular than the problem which it solves!&nbsp; The history behind this method is very interesting.&nbsp; It was originally <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=37422">published back in SIGGRAPH 87</a>, and then summarily patented by the Lorensen and Cline. &nbsp;This fact has caused a lot of outrage, and is been widely cited as one of the classic examples of patents hampering innovation.&nbsp; Fortunately, the patent on marching cubes expired back in 2005 and so today you can freely use this algorithm in the US with no fear of litigation.</p>
<p>Much of the popularity of marching cubes today is due in no small part to a famous article written by <a href="http://paulbourke.net/">Paul Bourke</a>. &nbsp;Back in 1994 he made a webpage called <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/">“Polygonizing a Scalar Field”</a>, which presented a short, self-contained reference implementation of marching cubes (derived from some earlier work by Cory Gene Bloyd.)&nbsp; That tiny snippet of a C program is possibly <strong><em>the most copy-pasted code of&nbsp;<span>all time</span></em></strong>. &nbsp;I have seen some variation of Bloyd/Bourke’s code in <strong>every</strong> implementation of marching cubes that I’ve ever looked at, without exception.&nbsp; There are at least a couple of reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paul Bourke’s exposition is really good. &nbsp;Even today, with many articles and tutorials written on the technique, none of them seem to explain it quite as well.&nbsp; (And I don’t have any delusions that I will do any better!)</li>
<li>Also their implementation is very small and fast. &nbsp;It uses some clever tricks like a precalculated edge table to speed up vertex generation.&nbsp; It is difficult to think of any non-trivial way to improve upon it.</li>
<li>Finally, marching cubes is incredibly difficult to code from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<p>This last point needs some explaining, &nbsp;Conceptually, marching cubes is rather simple. &nbsp;What it does is sample the implicit function along a grid, and then checks the sign of the potential function at each point (either +/-). &nbsp;Then, for every edge of the cube with a sign change, it finds the point where this edge intersects the volume and adds a vertex (this is just like ray casting a bunch of tiny little segments between each pair of grid points).&nbsp; The hard part is figuring out how to stitch some surface between these intersection points.&nbsp; Up to the position of the zero crossings, there are&nbsp;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E8+%3D+256&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^8 = 256" title="2^8 = 256"> different possibilities, each of which is determined by the sign of the function at the 8 vertices of the cube:</p>

<p>Even worse, some of these cases are ambiguous!&nbsp; The only way to resolve this is to somewhat arbitrarily break the symmetry of the table based on a case-by-case analysis. What a mess!&nbsp; Fortunately, if you just download Bloyd/Bourke’s code, then you don’t have to worry about any of this and everything will just work. &nbsp;No wonder it gets used so much!</p>
<h2>Marching Tetrahedra</h2>
<p>Both the importance of isosurface extraction and the perceived shortcomings of marching cubes motivated the search for alternatives. &nbsp;One of the most popular was the <a href="http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e74-d_1_214">marching tetrahedra</a>, introduced by Doi and Koide.&nbsp; Besides the historical advantage that marching tetrahedra was not patented, it does have a few technical benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Marching tetrahedra does not have ambiguous topology, unlike marching cubes.&nbsp; As a result, surfaces produced by marching tetrahedra are always manifold.</li>
<li>The amount of geometry generated per tetrahedra is much smaller, which might make it more suitable for use in say a geometry shader.</li>
<li>Finally, marching tetrahedra has only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E4+%3D+16&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^4 = 16" title="2^4 = 16"> cases, a number which can be further reduced to just 3 special cases by symmetry considerations. &nbsp;This is enough that you can work them out by hand.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise:&nbsp; </strong>Try working out the cases for marching tetrahedra yourself. &nbsp;(It is really not bad.)</p>
<p>The general idea behind marching tetrahedra is the same as marching cubes, only it uses a tetrahedral subdivision. &nbsp;Again, the standard reference for practical implementation is Paul Bourke (<a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/polygonise/">same page as before</a>, just scroll down a bit.) &nbsp;While there is a lot to like about marching tetrahedra, it does have some draw backs. &nbsp;In particular, the meshes you get from marching tetrahedra are typically about 4x larger than marching cubes. &nbsp;This makes both the algorithm and rendering about 4x slower. &nbsp;If your main consideration is performance, you may be better off using a cubical method. &nbsp;On the other hand, if you really need a manifold mesh, then marching tetrahedra could be a good option. &nbsp;The other nice thing is that if you are obstinate and like to code everything yourself, then marching tetrahedra may be easier since there aren’t too many cases to check.</p>
<h2>The Primal/Dual Classification</h2>
<p>By now, both marching cubes and tetrahedra are quite old. &nbsp;However, research into isosurface extraction hardly stopped in the 1980s.&nbsp; In the intervening years, many new techniques have been developed. &nbsp;One general class of methods which has proven very effective are the so-called `dual’ schemes. &nbsp;The first dual method, surface nets, was proposed by Sarah Frisken Gibson in 1999:</p>
<p>S.F. Gibson, (1999) “<a href="http://www.merl.com/papers/docs/TR99-24.pdf" target="_blank">Constrained Elastic Surface Nets</a>”&nbsp; Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, Technical Report.</p>
<p>The main distinction between dual and primal methods (like marching cubes) is the way they generate surface topology.&nbsp; In both algorithms, we start with the same input: a volumetric mesh determined by our samples, which I shall take the liberty of calling a&nbsp;<em>sample complex</em> for lack of a better term.&nbsp; If you’ve never heard of the word&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inperc.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cell_complex">cell complex</a>&nbsp;before, you can think of it as an n-dimensional generalization of a triangular mesh, where the `cells’ or facets don’t have to be simplices.</p>
<p>In the sample complex, vertices (or 0-cells) correspond to the sample points; edges (1-cells) correspond to pairs of nearby samples; faces (2-cells) bound edges and so on:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="534" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/samplecomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png" data-orig-size="533,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="samplecomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=533" title="samplecomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=235" height="235" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/samplecomplex.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Here is an illustration of such a complex. &nbsp;I’ve drawn the vertices where the potential function is negative black, and the ones where it is positive white.</p>
<p>Both primal and dual methods walk over the sample complex, looking for those cells which cross the 0-level of the potential function. &nbsp;In the above illustration, this would include the following faces:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="535" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/boundarycells/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png" data-orig-size="533,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="boundarycells" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=533" title="boundarycells" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300&amp;h=235" height="235" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/boundarycells.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h3>Primal Methods</h3>
<p>Primal methods, like marching cubes, try to turn the cells crossing the bounary into an isosurface using the following recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edges crossing the boundary become vertices in the isosurface mesh.</li>
<li>Faces crossing the boundary become edges in the isosurface mesh.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>n-cells crossing the boundary become (n-1)-cells in the isosurface mesh.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to construct a primal mesh for our sample complex would be the following:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="536" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/primalcomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png" data-orig-size="533,424" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primalcomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=533" title="primalcomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=238" height="238" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=238 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=119 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcomplex.png 533w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>This is pretty nice because it is easy to find intersection points along edges. &nbsp;Of course, there is some topological ambiguity in this construction.&nbsp; For non-simplicial cells crossing the boundary it is not always clear how you would glue the cells together:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="537" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/primalcell/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png" data-orig-size="929,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primalcell" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=640" title="primalcell" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300&amp;h=63" height="63" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=296&amp;h=63 296w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=591&amp;h=126 591w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=150&amp;h=32 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/primalcell.png?w=300&amp;h=64 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>As we have seen, these ambiguities lead to exponentially many special cases, and are generally a huge pain to deal with.</p>
<h3>Dual Methods</h3>
<p>Dual methods on the other hand use a very different topology for the surface mesh.&nbsp; Like primal methods, they only consider the cells which intersect the boundary, but the rule they use to construct surface cells is very different:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every edge crossing the boundary, create an (n-1) cell.&nbsp; (Face in 3D)</li>
<li>For every face crossing the boundary, create an (n-2) cell. (Edge in 3D)</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>For every d-dimensional cell, create an (n-d) cell.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li>For every n-cell, create a vertex.</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a much simpler topological structure:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="538" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/dualcomplex/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png" data-orig-size="537,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dualcomplex" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=537" title="dualcomplex" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=234" height="234" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=300&amp;h=234 300w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualcomplex.png 537w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The nice thing about this construction is that unlike primal methods, the topology of the dual isosurface mesh is completely determined by the sample complex (so there are no ambiguities).&nbsp; The disadvantage is that you may sometimes get non-manifold vertices:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="465" data-permalink="https://0fps.net/2012/07/12/smooth-voxel-terrain-part-2/dualmesh/" data-orig-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png" data-orig-size="589,245" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dualmesh" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=589" title="dualmesh" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=300&amp;h=124" height="124" width="300" srcset="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=298&amp;h=124 298w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png?w=150&amp;h=62 150w, https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dualmesh.png 589w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h2>Make Your Own Dual Scheme</h2>
<p>To create your own dual method, you just have to specify two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A sample complex.</li>
<li>And a rule to assign vertices to every n-cell intersecting the boundary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second item is the tricky part, and much of the research into dual methods has focused on exploring the possibilities. &nbsp;It is interesting to note that this is the opposite of primal methods, where finding vertices was pretty easy, but gluing them together consistently turned out to be quite hard.</p>
<h3>Surface Nets</h3>
<p>Here’s a neat puzzle: what happens if we apply the dual recipe to a regular, cubical grid&nbsp;(like we did in marching cubes)? &nbsp;Well, it turns out that you get the same boxy, cubical meshes that you’d make in a Minecraft game (topologically speaking)!</p>
<p><a href="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/exampledualmesh.png"><img title="exampledualmesh" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/exampledualmesh.png?w=150&amp;h=145" height="145" width="150"></a><a href="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spheresmoothed.png"><img title="spheresmoothed" alt="" src="https://0fps.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/spheresmoothed.png?w=150&amp;h=138" height="138" width="150"></a></p>
<p>Left: A dual mesh with vertex positions snapped to integer coordinates.&nbsp; Right: A dual mesh with smoothed vertex positions.</p>
<p>So if you know how to <a href="https://0fps.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/meshing-in-a-minecraft-game/">generate Minecraft meshes</a>, then you already know how to make smooth shapes! &nbsp;All you have to do is squish your vertices down onto the isosurface somehow. &nbsp;How cool is that?</p>
<p>This technique is called “surface nets” (remember when we mentioned them before?) &nbsp;Of course the trick is to figure out where you place the vertices. &nbsp;In Gibson’s original paper, she formulated the process of vertex …</p></div></div>

  <p>To create relevant search, processing clickstream data is key: you frequently want to promote search results that are being clicked on and purchased, and demote those things users don’t love.</p>
<p>Typically search systems think of processing clickstream data as a batch job run over historical data, perhaps using a system like Spark. But on Shopify’s Discovery team, we ask the question: What if we could auto-tune relevance in real-time as users interact with search results—not having to wait days for a large batch job to run?</p>
<p>At Shopify—this is what we’re doing! We’re using streaming data processing systems that can process both real-time and historic data to enable real-time use cases ranging from simple auto boosting or down boosting of documents, to computing aggregate click popularity statistics, building <a href="https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-concepts.html#judgments-expression-of-the-ideal-ordering" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">offline search evaluation sets</a>, and on to more complex reinforcement learning tasks.</p>
<p>But this article is introducing you to the streaming system themselves. In particular, to Apache Beam. And the most important thing to think about is <em>time</em> with those streaming systems. So let’s get started!</p>
<h2>What Exactly is Apache Beam?</h2>
<p><a href="https://beam.apache.org/" target="_blank" title="Apache Beam" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apache Beam</a> is a unified batch and stream processing system. This lets us potentially unify historic and real-time views of user search behaviors in one system. Instead of a batch system, like Spark, to churn over months of old data, and a separate streaming system, like Apache Storm, to process the live user traffic, Beam hopes to keep these workflows together.</p>
<p>For search, this is rather exciting. It means we can build search systems that both rely on historic search logs while perhaps being able to live-tune the system for our users’ needs in various ways.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an early challenge everyone faces with Beam: that of <strong><em>time!</em></strong> Beam is a kind of time machine that has to reorder events in their right spot after getting annoyingly delayed by lots of intermediate processing and storage step. This is one of the core complications of a streaming system - how long do we wait? How do we deal with late or out of order data?</p>
<p>So to get started with Beam, the first thing you’ll need to do is Hack Time!</p>
<h2>The Beam Time Problem</h2>
<p>At the core of Apache Beam are <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pipelines</a>. They connect a source through various processing steps to finally a sink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data flowing through a pipeline is timestamped. When you consider a streaming system, this makes sense. We have various delays as events flow from browsers, through APIs, and other data systems. Finally the events arrive at our Beam pipeline. They can easily be out-of-order or delayed. Beam source APIs, like the one for <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.5.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaIO.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kafka</a>, maintain a moving view of the event data to emit well-ordered events known as a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#watermarks-and-late-data" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">watermark</a>.</p>
<p>If we don’t give our Beam source good information on how to build a timestamp, we’ll drop events or receive them in the wrong order. But even more importantly for search, we likely must combine different streams of data to build a single view on a search session or query, like below:</p>
<figure><img alt="combine different streams of data to build a single view on a search session or query, like below" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Beam_for_Search__Getting_started_with_the_Beam_time_machine.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1610128718" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Beam_for_Search__Getting_started_with_the_Beam_time_machine.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1610128718"></figure>
<p>Joining (a Beam topic for another day!) needs to look back over each source’s watermark and ensure they’re aligned in time before deciding that sufficient time has elapsed before moving on. But before you get to the complexities of streaming joins, replaying with accurate timestamps is the first milestone on your Beam-for-clickstream journey.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Timestamp Right at the Source</h2>
<p>Let’s set up a simple Beam pipeline to explore Beam. Here we’ll use Kafka in Java as an example. You can see the full source code <a href="https://gist.github.com/geekigirl/738ead73033ae673483ab9690452f10f" target="_blank" title="Timestamp policy example with Kafka source with Apache BEAM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Here we’ll set up a Kafka source, the start of a pipeline producing a custom SearchQueryEvent stored in a search_queries_topic.</p>

<p>You’ll notice we have information on the topic/servers to retrieve the data, along with how to deserialize the underlying binary data. We might add further processing steps to transform or process our SearchQueryEvents, eventually sending the final output to another system.</p>
<p>But nothing about <strong>time</strong> yet. By default, the produced SearchQueryEvents will use Kafka <em>processing</em> time. That is, when they’re read from Kafka. This is the least interesting for our purposes. We care about when users actually searched and clicked on results.</p>
<p>More interesting is when the event was created in a Kafka client. Which we can add here:</p>
<p><code>.withCreateTime(Duration.<em>standardMinutes</em>(5))</code></p>
<p>You’ll notice above, when we use create time below, we need to give the source’s Watermark a tip for how out of order event times might be. For example, below we instruct the Kafka source to use create time, but with a possible 5 minutes of discrepancy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Appreciating The Beam Time Machine</h2>
<p>Let’s reflect on what such a 5 minute possible delay actually means from the last snippet. Beam is kind of a time machine… How Beam bends space-time is where your mind can begin to hurt.</p>
<p>As you might be picking up, <em>event time </em>&nbsp;is quite different from <em>processing time</em>! So in the code snippet above, we’re *not* telling the computer to wait for 5 minutes of execution time for more data. No, the event time might be replayed from historical data, where 5 minutes of event time is replayed through our pipeline in mere milliseconds. Or it could be event time is really now, and we’re actively streaming live data for processing. So we DO indeed wait 5 real minutes!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back and use a silly example to understand this. It’s really crucial to your Beam journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine we’re super-robot androids that can watch a movie at 1000X speed. Maybe like Star Trek The Next Generation’s Lt Commander Data. If you’re unfamiliar, he could process input as fast as a screen could display! Data might say “Hey look, I want to watch the classic 80s movie, The Goonies, so I can be a cultural reference for the crew of the Enterprise.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beam is like watching a movie in super-fast forward mode with chunks of the video appearing possibly delayed or out of order relative to other chunks in movie time. In this context we have two senses of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Time: the timestamp in the actual 1h 55 minute runtime of The Goonies aka movie time.</li>
<li>Processing Time: the time we actually experience The Goonies (perhaps just a few minutes if we’re super-robot androids like Data).</li>
</ul>
<p>So Data tells the Enterprise computer “Look, play me The Goonies as fast as you can recall it from your memory banks.” And the computer has various hiccups where certain frames of the movie aren’t quite getting to Data’s screen to keep the movie in order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commander Data can tolerate missing these frames. So Data says “Look, don’t wait more than 5 minutes in *movie time* (aka event time) before just showing me what you have so far of that part of the movie. This lets Data watch the full movie in a short amount of time, dropping a tolerable number of movie frames.</p>
<p>This is just what Beam is doing with our search query data. Sometimes it’s replaying days worth of historic search data in milliseconds, and other times we’re streaming live data where we truly must wait 5 minutes for reality to be processed. Of course, the right delay might not be 5 minutes, it might be something else appropriate to our needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beam has other primitives such as <a href="https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.0.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/windowing/Window.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">windows</a> which further inform, beyond the source, how data should be buffered or collected in units of time. Should we collect our search data in daily windows? Should we tolerate late data? What does subsequent processing expect to work over? Windows also work with the same time machine concepts that must be appreciated deeply to work with Beam.</p>
<h2>Incorporating A Timestamp Policy</h2>
<p>Beam might know a little about Kafka, but it really doesn’t know anything about <strong>our</strong> data model. Sometimes we need even more control over the definition of time in the Beam time machine.</p>
<p>For example, in our previous movie example, movie frames perhaps have some field informing us of how they should be arranged in movie time. If we examine our SearchQueryEvent, we also see a specific timestamp embedded in the data itself:</p>
<p><code>public class SearchQueryEvent {</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public final String queryString;</code></p>
<p><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public final Instant searchTimestamp;</code></p>
<p><code>…</code></p>
<p><code>}</code></p>
<p>Well Beam sources can often be configured to use a custom event time like our searchTimestamp. We just need to make a TimestampPolicy. We simply provide a simple function-class that takes in our record (A key-value of Long-&gt;SearchQueryEvent) and returns a timestamp:</p>

<p>We can use this to create our own timestamp policy:</p>

<p>Here, we’ve passed in our own function, and we’ve given the same allowed delay (5 minutes). This is all wrapped up in a factory class TimestampPolicyFactory SearchQueryTimestampPolicyFactory (now if that doesn’t sound like a Java class name, I don’t know what does ;) )</p>
<p>We can add our timestamp policy to the builder:</p>
<p><code>.withTimestampPolicyFactory(new SearchQueryTimestampPolicyFactory())</code></p>

Given its safety, </span><span>w</span><span>e call for immediate widespread increased vitamin D intakes</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D modulates thousands of genes and many aspects of immune function, both innate and adaptive. The scientific evidence</span><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;shows that:</span></p><p><span>Vitamin D is well known to be essential, but most people do not get enough. Two common definitions of inadequacy are deficiency &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L), the target of most governmental organizations, and insufficiency &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L), the target of several medical societies &amp; experts.</span><span>2</span><span>&nbsp;Too many people have levels below these targets. </span><span>Rates of vitamin D deficiency &lt;20ng/ml exceed 33% of the population in most of the world, and most estimates of insufficiency &lt;30ng/ml are well over 50% (but much higher in many countries).</span><span>3</span><span>&nbsp;Rates are even higher in winter, and several groups have notably worse deficiency: the overweight, those with dark skin (especially far from the equator), and care home residents. These same groups face increased COVID-19 risk.</span></p><p><span>It has been shown that 3875 IU (97mcg) daily is required for 97.5% of people to reach 20ng/ml, and 6200 IU (155mcg) for 30ng/ml,</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;intakes far above all national guidelines. Unfortunately, the report that set the US RDA included an admitted statistical error in which required intake was calculated to be ~10x too low.</span><span>4</span><span>&nbsp;Numerous calls in the academic literature to raise official recommended intakes had not yet resulted in increases by the time SARS-CoV-2 arrived. Now, many papers indicate that vitamin D affects COVID-19 more strongly than most other health conditions, with increased risk at levels &lt; 30ng/ml (75nmol/L) and severely greater risk &lt; 20ng/ml (50nmol/L).</span><span>1</span></p><p><span>Evidence to date </span><span>suggests </span><span>the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic sustains itself in large part &nbsp;through infection of those with low vitamin D, and that deaths are concentrated largely in those with deficiency. The mere possibility that this is so should compel urgent gathering of more vitamin D data. </span><span>Even without more data</span><span>, </span><span>the </span><span>preponderance </span><span>of evidence indicates that </span><span>increased vitamin D would help reduce infections, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, &amp; deaths</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Decades of safety data show that vitamin D has very low risk: </span><span>Toxicity would be extremely rare with the recommendations here. The risk of insufficient levels far outweighs any risk from levels that seem to provide most of the protection against COVID-19, and this is notably different from drugs. Vitamin D is much safer than steroids, such as dexamethasone, the most widely accepted treatment to have also demonstrated a large COVID-19 benefit. Vitamin D’s safety is more like that of face masks. </span><span>There is no need to wait for further clinical trials to increase use of something so safe, </span><span>especially when remedying high rates of deficiency/insufficiency should already be a priority</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, we call on all governments, doctors, and healthcare workers worldwide to immediately recommend and implement efforts appropriate to their adult populations to increase vitamin D, at least until the end of the pandemic. Specifically to:</span></p><p><span>Many factors are known to predispose individuals to higher risk from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as age, being male, comorbidities, etc., but </span><span>inadequate</span><span>&nbsp;v</span><span>itamin D is by far the most easily and quickly </span><span>modifiable</span><span>&nbsp;risk factor with abundant evidence to support a large effect</span><span>. Vitamin D is inexpensive and has negligible risk compared to the considerable risk of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>&nbsp;The following include 4000 IU within their tolerable intakes in official guidelines: NAM (US, Canada), SACN (UK), EFSA (Europe), Endocrine Society (international), Nordic countries, The Netherlands, Australia &amp; New Zealand, UAE, and the American Geriatrics Soc. (USA, elderly). No major agency specifies a lower tolerable intake limit. The US NAM said 4000 IU “is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals.” See also [</span><span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180081/">Giustina et al ‘20</a></span><span>].</span></p><p><span>The signatories below endorse this letter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div role="main"><div><article><p>Modern processors are quite complex, with many parts having the potential to become a bottleneck. It is relatively easy to reason about the performance of short pieces of code, especially if memory effects are kept to a minimum. Both static analysis tools like LLVM MCA and microbenchmarks can provide a lot of information in such cases. However, the behaviour of the whole program is not just the sum of those small parts. As the code becomes larger and more complex other effects start appearing. One of such potential problems are excessive instruction cache misses.</p><p>Every program has different properties, and those large-scale effects will affect it differently. However, if its job is to execute complex logic on a small amount of data, the instruction cache is likely to become a problem at some point. The actual impact may vary significantly from codebase to codebase, which is why I won’t show any numbers in this article. Let’s consider this just a collection of ideas, but it is not easy to tell how much any of them will help for a given application.</p><p>First, let’s have a quick look at the processor front end. Below is a simplified diagram of how it is arranged in Skylake, the numbers between units are the maxima per cycle.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="860" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-front-end.min.2e73578fff.svg" alt="CPU front end"></p><p>Each cycle the processor fetches up to 16 bytes from the instruction cache using information from the Branch Prediction Unit to predict the control flow. The pre-decode unit determines instruction lengths and puts up to five of them in the Instruction Queue. From the Instruction Queue, up to 5 instructions (with macro-fusion) are brought each cycle to the decoders. There is one complex decoder that can handle instructions that translate to up to 4 µops and 3 simple decoders that can handle only single-µop instructions. In total, all decoders are limited to producing no more than 5 µops each cycle. Instructions that require more than 4 µops go through Microcode Sequence ROM, which emits 4 µops per cycle, and while it is active, the decoders are disabled. There is also Decoded ICache (<abbr title="Decoded Stream Buffer">DSB</abbr>) which caches decoded µops. It can emit up to 6 µops each cycle. All µops, regardless of their source, end up in the Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ). The Loop Stream Detector (LSD) detects small loops and keeps them in the queue, so that no fetched, decodes or reads from the DSB are needed during the duration of the loop. IDQ is the last part of the front end, and the queued µops continue to the back end.</p><p>From the instruction cache point of view, the front end has two weaknesses. Firstly, instructions are processed in-order which can severely limit the processor ability to hide latencies of cache misses. HyperThreading can make sure that this part of the processor still does some useful work, but it is also the source of the second problem – all resources, including the L1 instruction cache and µop cache are shared between the hardware threads.</p><p>Modern processors provide various metrics that help monitor their behaviour. However, the task of extracting the relevant data requires a proper approach if it is to be done efficiently. Top-down analysis is invaluable with helping to understand microarchitectural phenomena in large codebases. The idea is to monitor program behaviour with the <abbr title="Performance Monitoring Unit">PMU</abbr> counters and identify the bottleneck starting with the major functional parts of the CPU and then digging deeper narrowing down on the exact source of the problem. It can be done in an automated way by tools like VTune or toplev.</p><pre><code>FE    Frontend_Bound:                                      39.48 +-  0.00 % Slots

    Pipeline)...
</code></pre><p>Above is an example of a toplev result. We can see that the instruction cache misses were the dominating bottleneck. Unsurprisingly instruction TLB misses also show up. On the front end bandwidth side of things, toplev points to the legacy decode pipeline. That makes perfect sense if the instructions are supplied from DSB or LSD, then there are no instruction fetches, and no cache misses.</p><p>Sometimes, the final summary may not provide sufficient information if there are changes in the code behaviour during the test. When that’s the case, a graph is likely to be a much more helpful way of presenting the results.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="950" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-toplev.min.2b465fdb6f.svg" alt="toplev"></p><p>Tools like toplev are great for initial identification of the problem, but once that’s done what we need is a right way for comparing different solutions. Ultimately, the most important metric is the actual performance of the program in a real-life workload. toplev still can be helpful as it shows the balance between different performance-limiting factors. What also can be useful is <code>perf stat</code> which can show the performance counter statistics. The event most relevant for us is <code>L1-icache-load-misses</code>, though there are more model-specific registers that may be of interest.</p><p>Now, that we know how to diagnose excessive instruction cache misses, let’s see what can be done to deal with this problem.</p><h2 id="avoiding-work">Avoiding work</h2><p>If the number of executed instructions is the problem, the most obvious solution is to try to reduce that number. Obviously, that’s much easier said than done, but there are some common patterns for dealing with this issue. One example would be prepared statements in databases. The general idea is that if a client knows it will send requests that have some commonality, it can tell the database engine early that the requests are going to match specific templates. This information allows the server to do as much work as possible during the preparation stage, thus reducing the amount of logic that needs to be executed for each individual request.</p><p>Extracting common patterns doesn’t have to be explicit. A server or any other kind of an application which actions depend on the user input could attempt to look for repeating patterns and cache some common parts. This is a very vague idea and most likely won’t be easily implementable in a lot of applications, but in some cases may be quite a natural solution. It also shows the main problem with the “just do less” approach – it is very application specific. On the plus, side, if this can be done, it is likely to help with the overall performance, not just the instruction cache misses.</p><p>Another potential problem is making sure that the preparation phase can really do something to help during the execution phase. If that means pre-computing some values, then it’s simple. However, if the only thing that preparation gives us is the knowledge which code paths are going to be exercised and which branches taken during the execution, it is going to be harder to take benefit from it. One option is to have some specialised code for the most common paths, C++ templates may come in handy here. If it is not easy to determine what may be the most common paths, then a just-in-time compiler may be used to generate code in the preparation stage.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><h2 id="batching-work">Batching work</h2><p>So far, we have been trying to reduce the number of executed instructions, by taking advantage of some earlier knowledge to avoiding repeating the same work. In other words, we have introduced two stages:</p><ul><li>preparation, which is performed rarely and, consequently, less performance critical</li><li>execution, which is done many times and is expected to dominate overall performance</li></ul><p>The way this can help with the instruction cache misses is that the execution stage, being smaller, is more likely to fit in the instruction cache. Whether this brings any measurable benefits depends highly on the type of the application and how much logic can be moved from execution to preparation stages.</p><p>We have already split our processing pipeline into preparation and execution stage. If the execution stage can fit in the instruction cache, we are done. However, often, that’s not the case. What we can do to improve the situation more is to split the execution into more stages. This time the goal is not to reuse work as it was with the preparation, but to group entities that need to have the same code executed for them. In other words, if the processing pipeline consists of steps A, B and C the idea is to separate them, add a queue in front of each of those stages, and then cycle through those stages each time handling multiple elements from the queue. Connections between the stages don’t have to be one-to-one, any directed graph is fine.</p><p><img loading="lazy" width="756" height="331" src="https://paweldziepak.dev/static/icache-seda.min.7259b25adc.svg" alt="SEDA diagram"></p><p>In the diagram above, there is one stage that feeds tasks to one of two stages. This could be, for example, a front-end of a database server. The first stage does some initial request processing and then, depending on whether it is a read or write, puts it in the appropriate queue. Each stage processes requests in batches, the first one warms up the instruction …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

It's like the distance a speeding car travels after the brakes are applied.</p>  <p>But Monday's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00955-x">study in the journal Nature Climate Change</a> calculates that a bit differently and now figures the carbon pollution already put in the air will push global temperatures to about 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times.</p>  <p>Previous estimates, including those accepted by international science panels, were about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) less than that amount of committed warming.</p>  <p>International climate agreements set goals of limiting warming to 2 C&nbsp;(3.6 F) since pre-industrial times, with the more ambitious goal of limiting it to 1.5 C&nbsp;(2.7 F) added in Paris in 2015. The world has already warmed about 1.1 C&nbsp;(2 F).</p>  <p>"You've got some ... global warming inertia that's going to cause the climate system to keep warming, and that's essentially what we're calculating," said study co-author Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. "Think about the climate system like the Titanic. It's hard to turn the ship when you see the icebergs."</p>  <p>Dessler and colleagues at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Nanjing University in China calculated committed warming to take into account that the world has warmed at different rates in different places and that places that haven't warmed as fast are destined to catch up.</p>    <p>Places such as the Southern Ocean, surrounding Antarctica are a bit cooler, and that difference creates low-lying clouds that reflect more sun away from earth, keeping these places cooler. But this situation can't keep going indefinitely because physics dictates that cooler locations will warm up more and when they do, the clouds will dwindle and more heating will occur, Dessler said.</p>  <p>Previous studies were based on the cooler spots staying that way, but Dessler and colleagues say that's not likely.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greenland-record-melt.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greenland-record-melt.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greenland-record-melt.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greenland-record-melt.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5693652.1597940952!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greenland-record-melt.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this Aug. 16, 2019 file photo, icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.

Breakthrough Institute climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said the new work fits better with climate models than observational data.</p>  <p>Just because the world is bound to get more warming than international goals, that doesn't mean all is lost in the fight against global warming, said Dessler, who cautioned against what he called "climate doomers."</p>  <p>If the world gets to net zero carbon emissions soon, 2 degrees of global warming could be delayed enough so that it won't happen for centuries, giving society time to adapt or even come up with technological fixes, he said.</p>  <p>"If we don't, we're going to blow through (climate goals) in a few decades," Dessler said. "It's really the rate of warming that makes climate change so terrible. If we got a few degrees over 100,000 years, that would not be that big a deal. We can deal with that. But a few degrees over 100 years is really bad."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>
