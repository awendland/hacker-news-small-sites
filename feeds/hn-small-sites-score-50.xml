The firm’s strategy has dramatic implications for the future of media and the venture capital industry. </p><p>This is the story of how Andreessen Horowitz disrupted the world of venture capital by cozying up to the media and then, how they purposefully threw that relationship away.</p><p>Let me tell you the story from the beginning.</p><p>About a decade ago, <strong>Margit Wennmachers</strong> sent an email to reporter <strong>Kara Swisher</strong>. </p><p>Swisher took a break from horseback riding to <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20100614/outcasts-wennmachers-joins-andreessen-horowitz-as-partner/">write that Wennmachers was leaving Outcast</a>, the communications agency she co-founded with <strong>Caryn Marooney</strong>. Wennmachers was joining the one-year-old venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as a full partner – a rare title for a woman in Silicon Valley, especially in 2010.</p><p>Wennmachers explained her strategy for positioning the firm in the early days, <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/20/brand-building-a16z-ideas-people-marketing/">in an interview</a> on Andreessen Horowitz’s in-house podcast. “I wanted to try and get a cover story because – this sounds old fashioned now, because everybody reads their news on Twitter and it's all online whatever – but there's still a statement that comes with a cover story that is in print, that you see at the airport,” she recalled. </p><p>With Wennmachers’ press savvy, <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>’s idea-a-second patter, and <strong>Ben Horowitz</strong>’s gravitas, the trio took Silicon Valley by storm. The firm outbid competitors for sought-after companies, spun up a slew of services for founders, and pitched its story relentlessly to the press.</p><p>With Wennmachers’ encouragement Andreessen penned a now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">historic Op-Ed</a> in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2011, titled, “Why Software is Eating the World.” The phrase became so ubiquitous that it can seem like everything eats the world these days. </p><p>“Margit is really a hidden founder of this firm,” a startup founder who has raised money from the firm told me. “The power dynamics there is, Marc, Ben, and Margit.” </p><p>Communications executives and reporters alike are in awe of Wennmachers for her sway with the media. “Comms in the Valley – she's the number 1 draft pick. She's very good,” one public relations person said. “I would never want to be crosswise with her.” </p><p>While Wennmachers’ strategy in that early period would have been familiar to many in Hollywood and Washington, it was less common in clubby and decorous Silicon Valley at the time. “She would say that was her job – to manage information so that she could shape the narrative,” one person who knows Wennmachers said. </p><p>Wennmachers deployed industry gossip and access to her firm’s partners to stay in the good favor of many reporters. </p><p>One communications executive at an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company recalled Wennmachers fishing for information about an upcoming story on behalf of reporters. Wennmachers pushed to deliver the information to the reporters herself, this executive said. </p><p>A high-powered rival PR executive described Wennmachers as an enforcer: “<em>You don't cross us and if you do, we shut off the information flow.</em>”</p><p>One member of the press recalled Wennmachers chasing down a potential bit of news. When Wennmachers returned the call and threw cold water on the story, the reporter took it in stride. Wennmachers told the reporter that they were now a “friend of the firm.” The comment struck the reporter as odd. They were just trying to get the facts right. But Wennmachers’ attitude seemed to reflect a coziness that she had come to expect from reporters dutifully covering Silicon Valley. </p><p>Wennmachers regularly hosted salon-style dinners at her home near the Presidio in San Francisco with reporters, portfolio companies, and the firm’s partners. While it’s not unusual for a venture capital firm to host reporters for a dinner, Wennmachers did it better than anyone else. When I attended one of her dinners in 2014, it felt like I’d finally gotten invited inside the Silicon Valley. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was invited to dinner at her house with members of the media. It was incredible,” one founder recalled. “That was like a cool invitation. If you were in the press you were really excited about getting dinner at Margit’s house, which is kind of mind-blowing if you think about it.” </p><p>Wennmachers can put on a friendly façade, but if you spend much time with her you come to realize that she’s a profoundly serious person. She doesn’t win over reporters because she’s fun. It’s because she cuts through the bullshit. She fundamentally understands what makes a good story. She knows what motivates reporters better than many reporters. That’s part of what makes the firm’s turn against the media so worrying.</p><p>Back in that early media heyday, Wennmachers doled the firm’s partners out to media companies who were eager to have them speak at lucrative conferences. And the firm’s partners were game to prophesize in audacious terms about what the future might look like, filling column inches.</p><p>Swisher and Wennmachers – two women who climbed their way to dominance in an industry overrun with men – are friendly to this day. Many Silicon Valley insiders strongly suspect that Wennmachers was one of Swisher’s sources when she covered Silicon Valley’s day-to-day dramas. But Swisher describes Wennmachers as fiercely loyal to her own companies, though Wennmachers “also did not pretend a problem I might call about was not one.” </p><p>Marc Andreessen himself had a cozy relationship with reporters like Swisher. "Marc is fully in charge of his own communications and has over time stopped wanting to deal with the press for lots of reasons, including some mistakes he made.” </p><p>From 2009 through 2015, Andreessen Horowitz earned a run of truly phenomenal press coverage, catapulting itself into the very top echelon of venture capital firms – at least based on its reputation. The media loved that bald headed internet geek and his gruff business guru sidekick. And over cocktails or lunch at the Battery, reporters probed Wennmachers for information, even if she rarely earned a mention in their stories. </p><p>Then the magazine writer <strong>Tad Friend </strong>pitched a profile of Marc Andreessen for the <em>New Yorker</em>. Wennmachers already saw the firm’s position in the popular consciousness beginning to shift. The firm was no longer an exciting upstart. “At that point I was at a stage where it was like ‘enough.’ ‘We're done talking about ourselves,’” Wennmachers said in the podcast interview. On the other hand, she reasoned, “The <em>New Yorker</em> is the <em>New Yorker</em>, so how often is the <em>New Yorker</em> going to write the definitive piece on venture capital? Once in a decade? Maybe? Well, do I want that to be about whoever or do I want that to be about us? At that point, I want to occupy that spot?” </p><p>She decided to do the story – though of course <em>she</em> wouldn’t occupy it. She merited a single passing mention. Marc Andreessen’s shiny head was the focus instead.</p><p>The story ran in May 2015, with the title, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man">Tomorrow’s Advance Man</a>.” The glowing portrait instantly became one of the seminal stories on the venture capital industry.</p><p>Despite running more than 10,000 words, the article made a single passing mention of one of Andreessen Horowitz’s most important investments, Zenefits. The firm had backed up the truck to invest in <strong>Parker Conrad’s</strong> human resources software company and hyped it in the press. But cracks had started to appear. By the end of 2015, Buzzfeed reporter <strong>Will Alden</strong> had planted the seeds of Zenefit’s unraveling, raising questions about whether the company’s health insurance brokers were properly licensed. </p><p>That same year, John Carreyrou revealed that Theranos had “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">struggled with its blood testing technology</a>.” Theranos had mostly raised money outside of Silicon Valley. But some venture capitalists tied their reputations to defending the company anyway. Marc Andreessen, who tweeted prolifically at the time, appeared to develop an affinity for blocking people who tweeted negatively about Theranos. </p><p>For reporters – and especially their editors – the Theranos story was a sign that tech reporters needed to take a more critical eye towards the startups they covered. Carreyrou was an investigative reporter, not on the Silicon Valley beat at all. Tech reporters shouldn’t have missed Theranos’s shortcomings. So, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>Then, indeed, Andreessen Horowitz found itself with a troubled portfolio company of its own. In May 2016, I reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-zenefits/?sref=WS92jZg5"> in Businessweek</a> about Zenefit’s self-disruption. Many other tech reporters also dug into the company’s failings.  </p><p>Behind the scenes, <strong>Kim Milosevich</strong>, then Wennmachers’ top lieutenant, went to task pointing much of the blame for the company’s implosion on its co-founder <strong>Parker Conrad</strong> – who certainly deserved a big portion of the credit for the company’s problems. </p><p>But Andreessen Horowitz partner <strong>Lars Dalgaard</strong> had cheered Conrad on, telling Conrad to double the company’s revenue growth target, I reported back then. Zenefits was the company Andreessen Horowitz wanted to grow, grow, grow. Years earlier, Ben Horowitz himself had <a href="https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/">penned an essay</a> making the case for “fat startups,” ones that spend aggressively to block out their competitors. Zenefits seemed to be running that playbook. </p><p>But as the company’s business started to falter and with mounting regulatory risk, Horowitz stepped in to help push Conrad to step aside. The firm laid the blame at Conrad’s feet. And <strong>David Sacks</strong>, who had been the company’s chief operating officer, was sold to the world as a turnaround CEO. </p><p>That same year, the press started to turn its attention to Andreessen Horowitz itself, wondering if this firm really lived up to all the hype we’d been fed over the years. </p><p>My occasional bridge partner, <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter <strong>Rolfe Winkler</strong>, wrote in …</p></div></div>

  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 20, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Comirnaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation">electroporation</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides and polymerase, and in some cases special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>A method to protect the mRNA from degradation either co- or post-transcriptionally.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore.</p>

<p>To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added. To do so while the mRNA is transcribed (co-transcriptionally) a 5’ cap analogue is added to the reaction mixture and incorporated by the polymerase when it reads a specific initiator sequence. There is only one vendor for this analogue; <a href="https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/cleancap-reagent-ag-3-ome.html">TriLink</a> and its partner <a href="https://www.tebu-bio.com/">tebu-bio</a> for the European market. Post-transcriptionally it can be done using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE).<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with these COVID vaccines.) The co-transcriptional method is generally more suitable for industrial processes as there is no need for an additional post-purification and it is faster since it works in one step. In their July 2020 investor update BioNTech refers to usings TriLinks trinucleotide cap and hence this is likely part of the production method of the approved vaccine.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Ultimately, the cap analogue or the VCE can drive cost and present bottlenecks if production is not increased accordingly.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message either by encoding it in the DNA template or using a Poly(A)Polymerase. Both <a href="https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics">BioNTech</a> and Moderna are using the faster and convenient DNA template approach.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is a key component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> and it is the most abundant lipid in the mix<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>.</p>
      </li>

<p>It was downloading a virtual private network that ultimately convinced Joe that he wanted to be a programmer. On the other side of China’s firewall three years ago, he stumbled across American journalist Steven Levy’s book <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</em>, which describes hackers not as malicious actors but people who saw the potential of the internet to benefit all — visionaries who understood early on the revolutionary possibility of computers. This idea, that programming could be chaotic and creative, resonated with Joe while he explored the internet beyond the reach of China’s censors.</p>



<p>“I found myself attracted by the idea of open source and hacker culture, and interested in the challenging part of programming,” said Joe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity. He learned to program by joining free web development classes online and looking at existing code on the Microsoft-owned GitHub, the world’s largest open source code repository. Today, he is a software engineer in Shanghai.</p>



<p>Open source code has been <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">essential</a> for the rapid growth of China’s tech sector. At Chinese tech companies, programmers like Joe have at their disposal foundational building blocks of code freely available on GitHub. This allows them to make their own rather than starting from scratch every time, meaning they can iterate and scale fast. With their code hosted in public for all to see, companies benefit from programmers around the world raking it over for errors; programmers learn from each other’s experiments and mistakes in real time. But while open source code has helped bolster China’s tech scene, the idea behind it — borderless exchange of information — contrasts with Beijing’s controlled approach to managing the internet.</p>



<p>Uncertainty hangs over GitHub’s future in China. Many fear that the site could be banned by China’s internet censors for hosting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">a workers’ protest</a> or <a href="https://qz.com/1846277/china-arrests-users-behind-github-coronavirus-memories-page/">information about the coronavirus</a>. Developers have raised concerns that American regulators could pull the plug over the company’s business with Chinese firms, though <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/culture/article/3029385/github-says-chinese-developers-are-safe-export-restrictions">GitHub has said</a> the open source code itself is exempt from these export controls.</p>



<p>Amid the tensions, Beijing has embraced open source in the development of emerging technologies, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. The goal is not only to position China on the global cutting edge of high-tech development but for Chinese companies to rely solely on homegrown talent and supply chains. In recent months, the Chinese government has championed domestic alternatives to widely used international open source institutions, particularly Gitee, a <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">direct parallel to GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But adopting open source technologies means embracing transparency, standardization, and a borderless philosophy — one that may sit uncomfortably with China’s push for technological self-reliance. “Basically, you cannot nationalize open source,” said Julian Sun, Beijing-based senior research director at tech industry analysis firm Gartner. “It’s already global.”</p>

<p>Rooted in the pioneering days of the early internet, the open source movement is founded on the concepts of iteration and reciprocal transparency. If one company’s developer wants to build a particular function into its software, they can go to a code repository like GitHub and see how others have solved the same problem. The more eyes there are on the code, the better it is; companies that make their code public benefit from developers combing it over, catching bugs, and submitting suggested fixes. GitHub has grown into the largest code repository in the world, with more than 40 million users and 206 million code repositories. Even the software behind <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinon-the-future-of-american-industry-depends-on-open-source-tech/">F-16 fighter jets</a> runs on open source technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China is home to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">fastest-growing number</a> of GitHub users outside of the U.S. Through the site, programmers in China don’t just learn new code — they are exposed to what they describe as the “open source way of thinking,” based on a philosophy of free exchange of ideas and information, without government interference or regulation. Despite the discordance of these principles with China’s approach to controlling the internet, code hosted on GitHub has been essential for the country’s tech sector. If it is blocked, developers know they need an alternative.</p>



<p>Developers’ concern the code hosted on GitHub could be a casualty of the escalating tensions with the U.S. was among the reasons for the Chinese government’s move to promote homegrown platforms, said Yik Chan Chin, a computer scientist and associate professor of communications at Beijing Normal University. “The technical community started to reflect on what the strategy is to protect information technology companies in the future. People started to worry. … What will happen to all the open source software and apps stored in that platform?”</p>



<p>In July, one of China’s top tech policymaking bodies, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, joined Huawei, Tencent, and a handful of top universities in a high-tech consortium <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">endorsing Gitee</a> as the official hub for China’s open source community. Shortly after, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu, and other tech companies announced <a href="https://www.openatom.org/#/projectList">the launch</a> of the OpenAtom Foundation, China’s answer to The Linux Foundation, a long-standing pillar of the international open-source community.</p>



<p>The foundation’s flagship project is Huawei’s mobile operating system, HarmonyOS, intended to rival the dominance of Android and Apple’s operating systems, with the code hosted on Gitee.</p>



<p>Huawei has previously relied on Google’s Android operating system, but the Chinese company’s inclusion on the Entity List has meant that Google can no longer support the partnership. Android is not only the most widely used mobile operating system in China, it’s also the basis for China’s varied, inventive, and well-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17988564/chinese-phone-software-android-iphone-copy-ui">app ecosystem</a>. The odds of success for HarmonyOS hinge on whether Huawei can encourage developers to build apps for the platform.</p>



<p>There are an estimated 780 million smartphone users in China, and Huawei accounts for <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/">more than 40%</a> of the smartphone market in the country. Huawei has said it’s aiming to get HarmonyOS onto <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3117573/huawei-aims-deploy-harmony-os-400-million-devices-2021-going-beyond">400 million</a> devices this year, including smartphones, wearables, and TVs. It could create an enormous market for developers to make products for Harmony in China alone. Developers have criticized the company for not yet releasing enough information to determine how truly independent the operating system is.</p>

<p>“Gitee’s future depends on attracting quality open source projects onto its platform, from both in and outside of China, which in turn attracts developers from both China and elsewhere to collaborate and contribute,” Kevin Xu, venture investor and founder of newsletter <a href="https://interconnected.blog/">Interconnected</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>“It takes years to build that kind of network effect among developers that GitHub has currently,” said Xu over email. “It’s impossible to know what will be the catalyst for Gitee. Having a central government ministry’s support does not help in either attracting top-tier projects or developers from inside and outside of China; it only helps with getting business from highly regulated or government customers.”</p>



<p>Gitee does have advantages over GitHub, which requires a baseline level of English to use. Many programmers in China either access the U.S. site through mirrors or through Chinese-language blogs, which can be outdated. GitHub’s leadership has expressed interest in opening a dedicated China operation, and authorities have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c6993200-1ff3-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b">reportedly encouraged</a> the company to expand, but that has yet to materialize. A more widely used Chinese-language environment could allow more programmers to join in on open source coding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Beijing’s push for a vibrant open source ecosystem based in China could be hamstrung by its own, long-standing objections to the environment that birthed the movement — the free and open exchange of information. The controlled internet behind the Great Firewall is not as rich with information as the unfettered web beyond it.</p>



<p>“There are differences in how people access knowledge in China versus how people access this information outside of China,” said Joe. “Because of the Great Firewall, there are huge quality differences between the knowledge and information you can get from Google and Wikipedia [vs] Baidu.”</p>

							<p>One of the biggest challenges of internet investigation is preserving data once you’ve found it. We have access to more information than ever before, but so much of it can be easily lost if we don’t take steps to archive it. If you’ve ever bookmarked an important resource only to come back later and see that it’s no longer available, you’ll know how frustrating it can be. I wrote about this problem last year in <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/the-attrition-of-information-in-osint-why-acting-quickly-matters-and-how-to-recover-when-you-dont/">this post about the Attrition of Information In OSINT</a> along with some suggestions about how to preserve internet material as well as how to recover data when it has been removed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a> is probably the most familiar tool for preserving web pages but it is not without its limitations. It can’t capture Facebook pages for instance, and even if you instruct it to begin archiving a site then it can easily fail if that site’s robots.txt prevents crawling. The increasing use of Javascript and embedded video content also makes scraping and archiving webpages more difficult. The preserved site you find on the Internet Archive is often missing much of the original content and features.</p>
<p>To counter this it is necessary to use several types of tool to preserve web content for your investigations rather than just relying on one. Hunchly is excellent for capturing web pages, but I still like to supplement it with YouTube-dl for grabbing video content. Recently I’ve also started using <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Quickstart">Archive Box</a> to build offline archives of web content that I want to keep. It wasn’t designed with OSINT work in mind but it is perfectly suited to the task of preserving and archiving web pages in multiple formats, including JavaScript-based websites and PDF/PNG screenshots. Video and audio content can also been downloaded and preserved.</p>
<p>Archive Box can build full archives of the websites listed in your bookmarks, browser history, or from a list of custom URLs that you provide. In the rest of this post I’ll show you how you can set up and install Archive Box and start to archive your own pages.</p>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Archive Box is written in Python and runs on Linux and Mac OS. It makes use of the native Linux/Mac programs like curl and wget to grab a lot of data so unlike many other Python tools it won’t run in Windows. If you want to use Archive Box in a Windows environment then you’ll need to install and run it with Docker as per these instructions <a href="https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox/wiki/Docker">here</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version (0.4.21) of Archive Box is available via Pypi, so that’s what we’ll install in this guide. It requires Python 3.7 or higher to run. I use Linux or MacOS for most tools like this but Archive Box will also run on Windows provided that you have <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows">already installed Python/Pip</a>.</p>
<p>To check your current version of Python 3 enter the console and type:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ python3 -V</code></p>
<p>If the version is less than 3.7, you’ll need to install a more up to date version of Python.</p>
<p>Once you’ve installed Python 3.7 (or higher), you can install Archive Box directly from PyPi with the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ pip install archivebox</code></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Python and Pip, have a read of <a href="https://nixintel.info/linux/build-your-own-custom-osint-machine-part-4/">this post</a> I wrote last year. If you’re using MacOS you can install Archive Box with Brew:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ brew install archivebox</code></p>
<p>There’s also a Docker image available for Archive Box which means you can also run it on Windows, you’ll just need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nX8U8Fz5S0">set up Docker first</a>. These days I prefer to use Docker images for OSINT tools but that’s for a future blog post.</p>
<p>Next you need to create a directory where your archive will be stored and complete the Archive Box setup there:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ mkdir myarchive &amp;&amp; cd myarchive 
$ archivebox init</pre>
<p>Once installation has finished, you’ll be ready to start building your archive.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
<p>All commands take the following format:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox [command] [argument]</code></p>
<p>To archive a single webpage, use the following command:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info'</pre>
<p>It’s also possible to add recursion to your request, so not only do you archive the page you specify, but Archive Box will also follow every link on the page and archive that too. The greater the depth, the further it will follow the links. Recursion can be added with the following option:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">$ archivebox add 'https://nixintel.info' --depth=1</pre>
<p>This will now archive the site and follow all the links within it to a depth of 1, and then archive all those pages too.</p>
<h3>Viewing The Archive</h3>
<p>Here’s the start of my new archive:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png" alt="" width="1458" height="295" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-2048x415.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-300x61.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-768x155.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_002-1536x311.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></p>
<p>To view your archive, open your browser and navigate to the index.html file in archive folder you created. It’ll be something like /home/username/myarchive/index.html. The archive records the time you created it, the link that was saved, and the original URL. Clicking on “Files” will show just how powerful Archive Box is:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png" alt="" width="1145" height="592" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-300x155.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-768x397.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_001-1536x794.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1145px) 100vw, 1145px"></p>
<p>The front page of my website has been saved as an offline local archive (complete with all necessary JavaScript so the appearance is identical to the live version), as pure HTML/CSS, as a PDF, a PNG screenshot, and you’ll also notice that Archive Box has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811201133/https://nixintel.info/">even archived a copy on the WayBack Machine too</a>. So now I have a full working archive of my site saved locally on my machine. This is a much better way to preserve a webpage than with simple screenshots, and even if the original site were to disappear (I hope not) I’d still have a full offline copy to work with.</p>
<h3>Archiving Multiple Websites</h3>
<p>An archive with one site in it isn’t much fun. Fortunately Archive Box also makes it easy to archive multiple sites at once, either from a list of URLs, or from your browser’s saved bookmarks. To archive multiple websites, create a text file like this, with one URL on each line.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false">https://osintcurio.us
https://bbc.co.uk/football 
https://theguardian.com</pre>
<p>Then we enter the following command (assuming your URL list is in the same directory as your archive):</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ cat url_list.txt | archivebox add</code></p>
<p>After a few minutes, all the listed websites have been added to my offline archive in the same range of formats as before:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png" alt="" width="1974" height="390" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004.png 1974w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-300x59.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-768x152.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_004-1536x303.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1974px) 100vw, 1974px"></p>
<p>The archive of the BBC Football page shows the advantage of saving in multiple formats. The site features a lot of custom video streams that can’t really be archived offline, so the local archive looks a little odd:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png" alt="" width="1063" height="500" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-2048x963.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-300x141.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-768x361.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_005-1536x722.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1063px) 100vw, 1063px"></p>
<p>Despite this the fact that PDF and PNG versions of the site are also created means we can still see what the site was like at the time it was archived. You’ll also notice a limitation of the Wayback Machine that I mentioned earlier. If a site doesn’t want to be crawled by the Wayback Machine, the only thing that will be preserved is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200811204518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/">301 error</a>. Archiving in multiple formats means that the chances of material being lost is significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Video Content</h3>
<p>Archive Box uses YouTube-dl so that it can archive video content too. Let’s say that you want to add <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be">this OSINTCurious Ten Minute Tip</a> to your archive. You can run the following command:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo_geMvcOg8&amp;feature=youtu.be</code></p>
<p>The entire 10 Minute Tip will now saved to your archive, including the video and audio files.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png" alt="" width="1098" height="290" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-2048x541.png 2048w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-300x79.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-768x203.png 768w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_006-1536x406.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px"></p>
<p>To access the archived video/audio, click on the “Media” link on the right. You’ll see that the video, audio and thumbnail content have all been archived and preserved offline:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png" alt="" width="933" height="238" srcset="https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007.png 933w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-300x77.png 300w, https://nixintel.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Selection_007-768x196.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px"></p>
<h3>Archiving Your Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Archive Box also allows you to create archives of websites saved in your bookmarks. Simply export a list of bookmarks from your browser (see instructions <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en">here</a> for Chrome and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer">here</a> for Firefox) as an HTML file and point Archive Box at it:</p>
<p><code data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="bootstrap4">$ archivebox add /path/to/bookmarks.html</code></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Being able to capture and preserve web content is a core skill for OSINT investigators. There are several technical challenges that make this difficult but Archive Box is a very effective way of gathering and preserving the information that you need.</p>
<p>Archive Box is in active development and it continues to receive new features and updates, so some elements of this post might become outdated in time. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ArchiveBoxApp">@ArchiveBoxApp</a> on Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/6fcaac97-a79b-4d89-982d-fe0823edb7e0/ColSanders.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""><br><em>"It's not his fault he doesn't know mal Bogle" says Col. Sanders</em></p>
<p>"I was once cursed by a warlock," says Col. Harlan Sanders, in not even his most unhinged piece of dialogue on this General Hospital episode.</p>
<p>Sanders is visiting character Maxie Jones to request she secure his secret recipe (all 11 herbs and spices), which had been threatened by a bomb Sanders himself defused using the classic esolang Malbolge. Unfortunately, this all happens offscreen.</p>
<p>Damian Spinelli, mentioned by Sanders, is a private investigator / hacker who General Hospital's casting describes as a mix between Seth Green and Sean Penn's Spicoli. Spinelli is unable to defuse the bomb, not knowing Malbolge, but Sanders had picked up a little of the Turing Tarpit as one randomly does (apparently without learning how to pronounce it) and saves the (only copy of this?) recipe from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Sanders feels no reservations about then asking Jones to then hide this recipe which has attracted this violence, which she does without question.</p>
<p>The full scene is here in two parts:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO8tIMQHFig" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6J3bI261tBQ" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Links: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO8tIMQHFig" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J3bI261tBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 2</a></p>
<p>For those who suspect this is created by a prankster, here it is tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/generalhospital/status/1015384908192190464?lang=en" target="">the show's account</a>.</p>

<p>Why, once again, is the esolang Malbolge chosen for an absurd tv storyline?</p>
<p>It is almost certainly tied to Malbolge's explicit connection with encryption; Malbolge programs self-encrypt as they run and writing Malbolge programs is a matter of finding "weaknesses" in the system that can be exploited in order to write working programs. While brainfuck is by far the widest-known esolang among programmers, Malbolge occasionally, and quite randomly, appears in a wider cultural context, always in terms of leetness, encryption, and mystery. Most likely, the General Hospital writers picked it up watching <em>Elementary</em>, which <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/interview-with-ben-olmstead" target="">included a Malbolge program left as a clue</a> from a killer.</p>
<p>Malbolge is the focus of the "weird internet," most notably in the <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/a-malbolge-mystery-c0d3-attorney" target="">still-unexplained site c0d3.attorney</a>. While c0d3.attorney does not offer any insight into Malbolge—the "programs" it lists don't work—it, like General Hospital, affirms Malbolge's status as <em>the</em> weird esolang. Ben Olmstead, Malbolge's creator, comments on the appearance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything, I think it illustrates how random culture can be: a weird throwaway thing—made in an afternoon—gets referenced on popular TV shows, has academic papers written about it, and still gets mentions on Twitter, 20 something years later. Meanwhile, people put in years or decades of work to create things that just... disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is how things work when your work of art or code helps inspire so much that comes after it.</p>

Working with containers always feels like magic. In a good way for those who understand the internals and in a terrifying - for those who don't. Luckily, we've been looking under the hood of the containerization technology for quite some time already and even managed to uncover that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/not-every-container-has-an-operating-system-inside/#container-is-just-a-processes">containers are just isolated and restricted Linux processes</a>, that <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-dont-need-an-image-to-run-a-container/">images aren't really needed to run containers</a>, and on the contrary - <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/you-need-containers-to-build-an-image/">to build an image we need to run some containers</a>.</p>
<p>Now comes a time to tackle the container networking problem. Or, more precisely, a single-host container networking problem. In this article, we are going to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to virtualize network resources to make containers think each of them has a dedicated network stack?</li>
<li>How to turn containers into friendly neighbors, prevent them from interfering, and teach to communicate well?</li>
<li>How to reach the outside world (e.g. the Internet) from inside the container?</li>
<li>How to reach containers running on a machine from the outside world (<em>aka</em> port publishing)?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, it'll become apparent that the single-host container networking is nothing more than a simple combination of the well-known Linux facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>network namespaces;</li>
<li>virtual Ethernet devices (veth);</li>
<li>virtual network switches (bridge);</li>
<li>IP routing and network address translation (NAT).</li>
</ul>
<p>And for better or worse, no code is required to make the networking magic happen...

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Any decent Linux distribution would probably suffice. All the examples in the article have been made on a fresh <em>vagrant</em> CentOS 8 virtual machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant init centos/8
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh

[vagrant@localhost ~]$ uname -a
Linux localhost.localdomain 4.18.0-147.3.1.el8_1.x86_64</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of simplicity of the examples, in this article, we are not going to rely on any fully-fledged containerization solution (e.g. <em>docker</em> or <em>podman</em>). Instead, we'll focus on the basic concepts and use the bare minimum tooling to achieve our learning goals.</p>
<h2 id="a-namenetnsaisolating-containers-with-network-namespaces"><a name="netns"></a>Isolating containers with network namespaces</h2>
<p>What constitutes a Linux network stack? Well, obviously, the set of network devices. What else? Probably, the set of routing rules. And not to forget, the set of netfilter hooks, including defined by iptables rules.</p>
<p>We can quickly forge a non-comprehensive <code>inspect-net-stack.sh</code> script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "&gt; Network devices"
ip link

echo -e "\n&gt; Route table"
ip route

echo -e "\n&gt; Iptables rules"
iptables --list-rules</code></pre>
<p>Before running it, let's taint the iptables rules a bit to make them recognizable:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo iptables -N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>After that, execution of the inspect script on my machine produces the following output:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

&gt; Route table
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.15 metric 100

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT
-N ROOT_NS</code></pre>
<p>We are interested in that output because we want to make sure that each of the containers we are going to create soon will get a separate network stack.</p>
<p>Well, you might have heard already, that one of the Linux namespaces used for containers isolation is called <em>network namespace</em>. From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html"><code>man ip-netns</code></a>, <em>"network namespace is logically another copy of the network stack, with its own routes, firewall rules, and network devices."</em> For the sake of simplicity, this is the only namespace we're going to use in this article. Instead of creating fully-isolated containers, we'd rather restrict the scope to only the network stack.</p>
<p>One of the ways to create a network namespace is the <code>ip</code> tool - part of the de facto standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip netns add netns0
$ ip netns
netns0</code></pre>
<p>How to start using the just created namespace? There is a lovely Linux command called <code>nsenter</code>. It enters one or more of the specified namespaces and then executes the given program:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0 bash
# The newly created bash process lives in netns0

$ sudo ./inspect-net-stack.sh
&gt; Network devices
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

&gt; Route table

&gt; Iptables rules
-P INPUT ACCEPT
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-P OUTPUT ACCEPT</code></pre>
<p>From the output above it's clear that the <em>bash</em> process running inside <code>netns0</code> namespace sees a totally different network stack. There is no routing rules at all, no custom iptables chain, and only one loopback network device. So far, so good...</p>

<h2 id="a-namevethaconnecting-containers-to-host-with-virtual-ethernet-devices-veth"><a name="veth"></a>Connecting containers to host with virtual Ethernet devices (veth)</h2>
<p>A dedicated network stack would be not so useful if we could not communicate with it. Luckily, Linux provides a suitable facility for that - a virtual Ethernet device! From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html"><code>man veth</code></a>, <em>"veth devices are virtual Ethernet devices. They can act as tunnels between network namespaces to create a bridge to a physical network device in another namespace, but can also be used as standalone network devices."</em></p>
<p>Virtual Ethernet devices always go in pairs. No worries, it'll be clear when we take a look at the creation command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name ceth0</code></pre>
<p>With this single command, we just created a pair of <em>interconnected</em> virtual Ethernet devices. The names <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> have been chosen arbitrarily:</p>
<pre><code>$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: ceth0@veth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@ceth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,M-DOWN&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>veth0</code> and <code>ceth0</code> after creation resides on the host's network stack (also called root network namespace). To connect the root namespace with the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we need to keep one of the devices in the root namespace and move another one into the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set ceth0 netns netns0

# List all the devices to make sure one of them disappeared from the root stack
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:e3:27:77 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
6: veth0@if5: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 96:e8:de:1d:22:e0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns netns0</code></pre>
<p>Once we turn the devices on and assign proper IP addresses, any packet occurring on one of the devices will immediately pop up on its peer device connecting two namespaces. Let's start from the root namespace:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ip link set veth0 up
$ sudo ip addr add 172.18.0.11/16 dev veth0</code></pre>
<p>And continue with the <code>netns0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/netns0
$ ip link set lo up  # whoops
$ ip link set ceth0 up
$ ip addr add 172.18.0.10/16 dev ceth0
$ ip link
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
5: ceth0@if6: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 66:2d:24:e3:49:3f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0</code></pre>

</div>

<p>We are ready to check the connectivity:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0`, ping root's veth0

<p>At the same time, if we try to reach any other addresses from the <code>netns0</code> namespace, we are not going to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># Inside root namespace
$ ip addr show dev eth0
2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000

# Try host's eth0
$ ping 10.0.2.15
connect: Network is unreachable

# Try something from the Internet
$ ping 8.8.8.8
connect: Network is unreachable</code></pre>
<p>That's easy to explain, though. There is simply no route in the <code>netns0</code> routing table for such packets. The only entry there shows how to reach <code>172.18.0.0/16</code> network:</p>
<pre><code># From `netns0` namespace:
$ ip route

<p>Linux has a bunch of ways to populate the routing table. …</p></div></div>

January 19, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>We recently announced a license change: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">FAQ</a>. We posted some <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">additional guidance</a> on the license change this morning. I wanted to share why we had to make this change.
</p><p>This was an incredibly hard decision, especially with my background and history around Open Source. I take our responsibility very seriously. And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. It has no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises. Its goal, hopefully, is pretty clear.
</p><p>So why the change? AWS and Amazon Elasticsearch Service. They have been doing things that we think are just NOT OK since 2015 and it has only gotten worse. If we don’t stand up to them now, as a successful company and leader in the market, who will?
</p><p>Our license change is aimed at preventing companies from taking our Elasticsearch and Kibana products and providing them directly as a service without collaborating with us.
</p><p>Our license change comes after years of what we believe to be Amazon/AWS misleading and confusing the community - enough is enough.
</p><p>We’ve tried every avenue available including going through the courts, but with AWS’s  ongoing behavior, we have decided to change our license so that we can focus on building products and innovating rather than litigating.
</p><p>AWS’s behavior has forced us to take this step and we do not do so lightly. If they had not acted as they have, we would not be having this discussion today.
</p><p>We think that Amazon’s behavior is inconsistent with the norms and values that are especially important in the open source ecosystem. Our hope is to take our presence in the market and use it to stand up to this now so others don’t face these same issues in the future.
</p><p>In the open source world, trademarks are considered a great and positive way to protect product reputation. Trademarks have been used and enforced broadly. They are considered sacred by the open source community, from small projects to foundations like Apache to companies like RedHat. So imagine our surprise when Amazon launched their service in 2015 based on Elasticsearch and called it Amazon Elasticsearch Service. We consider this to be a pretty obvious trademark violation. NOT OK.
</p><p>I took a personal loan to register the Elasticsearch trademark in 2011 believing in this norm in the open source ecosystem. Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.
</p><p>We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.
</p><p>When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc3e3a971d3b695d3/6006e46a0069f70f7771dab5/amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg" data-sys-asset-uid="bltc3e3a971d3b695d3" alt="amazon-cto-tweet-license-change.jpg"></p><p>When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.
</p><p>More on this <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">here</a>. NOT OK.
</p><p>Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as "inspiration" for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.
</p><p>We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it. We even work with other parts of Amazon. We are always open to doing that; it just needs to be OK.
</p><p>I believe in the core values of the Open Source Community: transparency, collaboration, openness. Building great products to the benefit of users across the world. Amazing things have been built and will continue to be built using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
</p><p>And to be clear, this change most likely has zero effect on you, our users. And no effect on our customers that engage with us either in cloud or on premises.
</p><p>We created Elasticsearch; we care about it more than anyone else. It is our life’s work. We will wake up every day and do more to move the technology forward and innovate on your behalf.
</p><p>Thanks for listening. If you have more questions or you want more clarification please read <a href="https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing">here</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:elastic_license@elastic.co">elastic_license@elastic.co</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <section>
    <p><img src="https://www.lffl.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-powershell.jpg" alt="Linux and powershell"></p>
<h2 id="what-powershell">What powershell?</h2>
<p><strong>Powershell</strong> is an object-based shell born in Microsoft in 2006, made open source 10 years later. It is characterized by commands, called <em>cmdlets</em>, which respect a certain pattern. An example cmdlet is as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>value</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The pattern in question is <code>Verb-Noun -Option argument</code>, where <em>Verb</em> is a list of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7.1">verbs</a>. <em>Noun</em> is a description of what impacts the command verb. The <em>Option</em> instead are preceded by a dash and its name; to follow, all the <em>arguments</em> of the option.</p>
<p>This pattern guarantees two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>readability</strong>: if you read the command, you know what it does. For example, the previous command shows that: I get all the child objects of a given path (files and folders).</li>
<li><strong>standard</strong>: following such a strict standard, it is possible to introduce various new commands already knowing (thanks to readability) what they do.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-powershell-on-linux">Why powershell on Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux has a great scripting tool: <em>bash</em> . Bash is a shell that provides us with a very simple but effective scripting language to write various automatisms. The only problem with bash is that any output is a string and must be treated as such; therefore, we use the same task we took as an example in powershell; we list the files and directories in a given path:</p>
<p>The output produced by this command is a string, so if we need to search for something we have to pass the output as the input of another command, through the pipeline.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls -l path <span>|</span> grep whatever
</code></pre></div><p>Each powershell output is an object. Each object has its own properties that can be used through other cmdlets. For example, the above command will output a <strong>System.Array</strong> type. This type of object can be used by an iterator (such as the <code>for</code> loop) or by a filter cmdlet, such as <code>Where-Object</code>.</p>
<p>Powershell is an excellent tool for a linux distribution because it offers a series of commands useful for developing tools and automatisms that are very difficult to implement with simple strings.</p>
<h2 id="installation-on-linux">Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>Depending on your distribution, installing powershell on Linux is a fairly simple task. If you have Debian or Ubuntu, we can install it thanks to <em>snapd</em> , like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ sudo apt install snapd
$ snap install powershell
</code></pre><p>Instead on Red Hat based distributions, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/prod.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft.repo
$ sudo yum install -y powershell
</code></pre><p>To activate powershell, just type <code>pwsh</code>.</p>
<h3 id="other-distribution">Other distribution</h3>
<p>For installation on other distributions refer to the official Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7.1">installation page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts-and-modules-automations">Scripts and modules: automations</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of powershell is that you can save commands and various code parts in script and module files.</p>
<h3 id="scripts">Scripts</h3>
<p>To create a script file, just write powershell to a file with the <em>.ps1</em> extension, and parse it to the <code>pwsh</code> interpreter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span># file myscript.ps1</span>

<span># Get all file modified in the last 3 days</span>
<span>Get-ChildItem</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>path</span> <span>-Recurse</span> <span>|</span> <span>Where-Object</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>$_</span><span>.</span><span>LastWriteTime</span> <span>-gt</span> <span>(</span><span>Get-Date</span><span>).</span><span>AddDays</span><span>(-</span><span>3</span><span>)</span> 
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We have created a script that tells us all files changed in the last 3 days. Fantastic. Now let’s call it from the command line: <code>pwsh myscript.ps1</code></p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>Not all tasks are sequential commands and not all tasks can be contained in a single powershell file. For this, we will use module to collect our functions.</p>
<p>Let’s take the script from earlier. Let’s turn it into a function and put it into a module. The module consists of a module file with the extension <code>.psm1</code> and a module manifest file with the extension<code> .psd1</code>. First, let’s create the module.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ mkdir mymodule
$ touch mymodule/mymodule.psm1
$ pwsh

<p>Of course it is possible to install modules from the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/">official repository</a>, for various uses. On a Linux distribution, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/PSCouchDB">PSCouchDB module</a> is useful if you are an administrator of a no-sql database such as CouchDB.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Install-Module</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>PSCouchDB</span>
<span>PS </span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Get-CouchDBDatabase</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This module simplifies the management of the databases and documents that define the characteristic structure of CouchDB. Alternatively, you can use <code>curl</code> but commands for complex tasks will be very long.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Finally, the goal of powershell in general is to facilitate the end user in scripting simple and complex tasks. Bash is a great tool for many tasks, but powershell can help solve some problems like filtering complex output, thanks to its object-oriented structure. Definitely a great choice for many activities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>
          You should already know how big tech companies like
          <i>Google</i> or <i>Facebook</i> are using your private data to make
          revenue from targeted ads (and sometimes maybe
          <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46618582">sell it under the hood</a>
          without your knowledge). There is no secret about
          <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">data being the most valuable asset on earth now</a>
          - even exceeding the oil.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some people say "I have nothing to hide, I don't care" which is
          essentialy ignoring basic human right and making this right worthless
          to you and very precious to others. We are already living in
          <i>Cyberpunk</i> era and the world is starting to be led by big
          organizations rather than governments so let's try to prepare
          ourselves and start to care about our data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think <i>Google</i> and <i>Facebook</i> are particulary bad when it
          comes to the data - we all heard about <i>Cambridge Analytica</i> and
          lately about <i>Whatsapp scandal</i>. Removing <i>Facebook</i> account
          is slightly easier than moving away from your <i>Google</i> account.
          It's impossible to just toggle some settings and let go your gmail
          address, google search, photos, youtube - pretty much your entire
          digital life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently <i>Google</i> changed their policy for storing photos.
          Starting from July 2021 you won't have unlimited High Quality storage
          as before rather than 15GB limit. This is still okay in terms of space
          but the politics behind it is just disgusting. <i>Google</i> was
          effectively feeding it's photo AI algorithms for face detection and
          tagging for years now using user data obtained by giving up the
          service for free. Now when these algorithms got so good and it's
          almost impossible to make them better and <i>Google</i> don't need
          users anymore they switched to make some money from the service.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To download and backup all your data it's best to use
          <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><i>Google Takeout</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the intructions and soon you'll get an email with links to your
          data. After you safely obtain it, start clearing your
          <i>Google</i> account.
        </p>

        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <i>Google Photos</i>
            <p>
              To remove all photos and videos you need to go to
              <a href="https://photos.google.com/">photos.google.com</a> and
              remove them from there. This might not be as quick as clicking a
              button.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Youtube, Gmail, Google One</i>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">Delete services or account</a>
              page and choose what services to remove.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Meet &amp; Calendar</i>
            <p>
              Hard one. People often invite you for online meetings using both
              services. You can't force them to not use those but you can always
              use private browser mode.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Google Search</i>
            <p>
              Hardest one. Google's core product and definetely the best one on
              the market. You can switch to
              <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a> which is okay
              and does the job.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I know it's really hard to remove <i>Youtube</i> and <i>Gmail</i> for
          example. There is no other place than <i>Youtube</i> where all my
          favourite creators are and many people already have my
          <i>Gmail</i> address and contacting me via this one. What I did is
          setup an email forwarding (yes I know Google can still track messages)
          and start using <i>Youtube</i> only via iOS App to avoid auto-logging
          in browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are really hardcore about this you can always go and
          <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/deleteaccount">Delete account completely</a>
          🤫

<p>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Edward Snowden are just 3 of the influential advocates for Signal—a messaging app that’s like WhatsApp, but with more of a focus on privacy.</p>

<p>The answer to that depends on a number of factors, one being how easy the experience of migrating from WhatsApp to Signal is. So let’s take a look.</p>

<p>Björn Ottosson recenty published a blog post introducing <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a>. The blog claimed that Oklab is a better perceptual color space than what came before. It piqued my interest, and I wanted to see for myself.</p>

<p>In exploring perceptual color spaces, I find an interactive gradient tool to be invaluable, so I’ve reproduced one here:</p>





<!--Jerry-rigged color picker-->




<h2 id="why-and-when-a-perceptual-color-space">Why (and when) a perceptual color space?</h2>

<p>Most image processing is done using a device color space (most often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a>), and most libraries and interfaces expose that color space. Even when an image editing tool or a standard (such as CSS) exposes other color spaces, it’s still most common to use the device color space. But for some use cases, a perceptual color space can give better results.</p>

<p>Basically <em>the</em> central question of color theory is how colors (in the physical sense) are perceived. The trichromacy assumption basically groups colors into equivalence classes in a three-dimensional space, and display devices generally produce colors by mixing three additive primaries: the familiar red, green, and blue.</p>

<p>In an ideal perceptual color space, the distance of two points in the space would correlate strongly with the <em>perception</em> of color difference. Put another way, all pairs separated by a “just noticeable difference” would be separated by an equal distance.</p>

<p>As it turns out, such a thing is no more possible than flattening an orange peel, because color perception is inherently <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900785_Non-Euclidean_Structure_of_Spectral_Color_Space">non-Euclidean</a>. To put it another way, the ratio of perceptually distinct steps around a hue circle to those directly across through gray is greater than would be expected as a circle in an ordinary Euclidean space.</p>

<p>Even so, like map projections, it is possible to make a color space that approximates perceptual uniformity and is useful for various tasks. One of these, a primary focus of this blog post, is smoother gradients.</p>

<p>Gradients are of course very similar to color scales, and a good perceptual color space can be used as the basis for those. An even better approach is to use a real color appearance model, as was done in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU">A Better Default Colormap for Matplotlib</a>, and is well explained and motivated in that video (it contains a brief introduction to color science as well).</p>

<p>A major application of perceptual color spaces is image manipulation, especially changing the color saturation of an image. This is a particular place where hue uniformity is important, as you don’t want hues to shift. Also, prediction of lightness is especially important when transforming a color image to black and white.</p>

<p>Perceptual color spaces are also a good basis for programmatic manipulation of color palettes, for example to create sets of colors in particular relation to each other, or to derive one of dark and light mode from the other. For example, the normal/hover/active/disabled states of a button may be different lightness and saturation values of the same hue, so hue shift would be undesirable. In particular, I think a future evolution of the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes">Blend modes</a> should have at least the option to do the blending in a high quality perceptual color space.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned by Björn, a color picker widget can benefit from a good perceptual space. It should be possible to adjust lightness and saturation without affecting hue, in particular.</p>

<p>Much of the literature on perceptual color spaces is geared to image compression, with two primary motivations. First, as compression adds errors, you generally want those errors distributed evenly in perceptual space; it wouldn’t be good at all to have artifacts that appear more prominently in areas of a particular shade. Second, good compression depends on a clean separation of lightness and chroma information, as the latter can be compressed better.</p>

<p>All that said, there are definitely cases where you do <em>not</em> want to use a perceptual space. Generally for image filtering, antialiasing, and alpha compositing, you want to use a linear space (though there are subtleties here). And there are even some cases you want to use a device space, as the device gamut is usually nice cube there, while it has quite the complex shape in other color spaces.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-gradients">Focus on gradients</h2>

<p>This blog post will use gradients as the primary lens to study perceptual color spaces. They are a very sensitive instrument for certain flaws (especially lack of hue uniformity), and a useful goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2 id="no-one-true-gamma">No one true gamma</h2>

<p>The transfer function for neutral colors is the literal backbone of any color space. Commonly referred to as “gamma,” it is one of the most commonly misunderstood topics in computer graphics. <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a> is a definitive account, and I refer the interested reader there, but will try to summarize the main points.</p>

<p>An ideal transfer function for gradients will have perceptually equal steps from black to white. In <em>general,</em> the transfer function in CIELAB is considered close to perceptually uniform, but as always in color perception, the truth is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>In particular, perception depends on viewing conditions. That includes the ambient light, but also the surround; the same gradient surrounded by white will appear darker than when surrounded by black. For an extremely compelling demonstration of the power of surround to affect the perception of lightness, see <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html">Akiyoshi’s illusion pages</a>, for example <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/light2e.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Another complication is that the light received by the eye includes so-called “veiling glare,” a fraction of ambient light reflected by the monitor because its black is not a perfect absorber (veiling glare is much less of a problem in movie-like conditions).</p>

<p>The actual CIELAB transfer function is not a perfect cube-root rule, but rather contains a linear segment in the near-black region (the sRGB transfer function is similar but has different parameters). This segment increases perceptual uniformity of ramps in the presence of veiling glare, and also makes the transform robustly invertible using lookup tables.</p>

<p>There is good science on how perception varies with viewing conditions, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02">CIECAM</a> color appearance model has parameters that can fine-tune it when these are known. But in practice, viewing conditions are not known, and the best approach is to adopt a best guess or compromise.</p>

<h3 id="hdr">HDR</h3>

<p>HDR is a different story, and I need to go into it to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICtCp">ICtCp</a> color space.</p>

<p>In standard dynamic range, you basically assume the visual system is adapted to a particular set of viewing conditions (in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB">sRGB</a> specifies an exact set of viewing conditions, including monitor brightness, white point, and room lighting). A perceptually uniform gradient from black to white is also useful for image coding, because if you set number of steps so that each individual step is <em>just</em> imperceptible, it uses a minimum number of bits for each sample while faithfully rendering the image without artifacts. And in sRGB, 256 level is just barely enough for most uses, though steps are often visible when displaying gradients, the case where the eye is most sensitive to quantization errors.</p>

<p>In HDR, however, this approach doesn’t quite work. Because of the wider range of brightness values from the display device, and also weaker assumptions about the viewing conditions (darkened rooms are common for movie viewing), the human visual system might at any time be adapted to quite light or quite dark viewing conditions. In the latter case, it would be sensitive to much finer gradations in near-black shades than when adapted to lighter conditions, and a similar situation is true the other way around. If tuned for any one single brightness level, results will be good when adaptation matches, but poor otherwise.</p>

<p>Thus, HDR uses a different approach. It uses a model (known as the Barten model, and shown in Figure 4.6 of <a href="http://poynton.ca/PDFs/Poynton-2018-PhD.pdf">Poynton’s thesis</a>) of the minimum contrast step perceptible at each brightness level, over all possible adaptation conditions. The goal is to determine a sequence of steps so that each step is just under the threshold of what’s perceptible under <em>any</em> viewing conditions.</p>

<p>The SMPTE ST 2084 transfer function is basically a mathematical curve-fit to the empirical Barten model, and has the property that with 12 bits of code words, each step is just under 0.9 of the minimum perceptual difference as predicted by the Barten model, across a range from 0.001 to 10,000 nits of brightness (7 orders of magnitude). There’s lots more detail and context in the presentation <a href="https://www.avsforum.com/attachments/smpte-2014-05-06-eotf-miller-1-2-handout-pdf.1347114/">A Perceptual EOTF for Extended
Dynamic Range Imagery</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>That said, though it’s sophisticated and an excellent fit to the empirical Barten curve, it is <em>not</em> perceptually uniform at any one particular viewing condition. In particular, a ramp of the ST 2084 curve will dwell far too long near-black (representing a range that would be more visible in dark viewing conditions). To see this for yourself, try the black+white button in the interactive explorer above.</p>

<h3 id="a-comparison-of-curves">A comparison of curves</h3>

<p>We can basically place curves on a scale from “way too dark” (ST 2084) to “way too light” (linear light), with all the others in between. CIELAB is a pretty good median (though this may express my personal preference), with IPT a bit lighter and Oklab a bit darker.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/colorspace_transfer_functions.png" width="575"></p>

<p>I found Björn’s arguments in favor of pure cube root to be not entirely compelling, but this is perhaps an open question. Both CIELAB and sRGB use a finite-derivative region near black. Is it important to limit derivatives for more accurate LUT-based calculation? Perhaps in 2021, we will almost always prefer ALU to LUT. The conditional part is also not ideal, especially on GPUs, where branches can hurt performance. I personally would explore transfer functions of the form $f(x) = a + (b + cx)^\gamma$, constrained so $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, as these are GPU-friendly and have smooth derivatives. The XYB color space used in JPEG XL apparently uses a bias rather than a piecewise linear region, as well.

<p>The foundation of a CNC router is some sort of rigid frame. On top of the frame you attach linear guides which allow your axes to move. You actuate that movement with belts or screws, whose rotation is powered by motors. Those motors are controlled by a pulse generator attached to a gcode intepreter, which gets its commands from a gcode sender. I'll cover all your major options below.</p>
<hr>

<p>The frame is the main body of your machine. You should use the most rigid material you are able to work with.</p>

The main disadvantage is that wood is not rigid enough to resist cutting forces, leading to chatter and low-quality surface finishes. A secondary concern is that wood is very dimensionally unstable, easily fluctuating with temperature and humidity changes.</p>
<p>If you never intend to cut any material harder than wood and you are comfortable never achieving tight tolerances or repeatable dimensions, a wooden frame can be a very economical choice. If you are primarily making art pieces rather than functional mechanical parts subject to tolerances, this might be a good choice for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/mpcnc.jpg" alt="Mostly Printed CNC" title="The Mostly Printed CNC"></p>
<p>The Mostly Printed CNC and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njs0FU6PfPg">others</a> like it make use of cheap extruded metal tube to serve as bones and 3D printed parts to serve as joints. Many of these designs don't require metalworking skills of any kind except to cut metal tubes to length. Given the ubiquity of 3D printers nowadays, these designs are extremely accessible, maybe moreso than wooden designs.</p>
<p>Their primary weakness is that 3D printed parts aren't very rigid, so the precision, repeatability, and surface finish of parts created on these machines is limited. Another common weakness in these designs is to use the extruded metal surface as the linear guide. Extruded metal is not a precision surface so any surface imperfections in the metal will translate to imperfections in the finished work. This limits the usefulness to hobby and art projects.</p>
<p>I should mention that "low-precision" for a CNC router might mean give or take 30 thousandths of an inch. If you are a woodworker used to table saws and pencil-drawn lines, tolerances that tight are fantastic and either a wooden frame or mostly printed frame will likely exceed your needs.</p>
<h2 id="extruded-aluminum-aka-8020">Extruded Aluminum aka 8020</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/avidcnc.jpg" alt="Avid CNC" title="Avid CNC"></p>
<p>A very popular choice for router frames is aluminum 8020. The extruded profiles can be ordered in many dimensions and some providers like <a href="https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501010000/?searchFlow=results2category&amp;KWSearch=Aluminum%20extrusions">Misumi</a> will not only cut them to length for you, they will drill and countersink holes, they will tap ends, and perform many other operations for you right in their factory.</p>
<p>The ease of working with 8020 cannot be overstated. If you have a miter saw you can easily cut it to length yourself to produce whatever design you like. The main advantages are that you get the rigidity of metal-on-metal joints and the infinite reworkability of a lego set without the difficulty of more traditional metalworking.</p>
<p>Some providers can even mill precision surfaces onto your extrusion, allowing it to play double duty as a structural member and a linear guide.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of 8020 are that it is more costly than extruded aluminum tube and that it isn't as rigid as steel. Still, it is a very popular choice because it is the cheapest, easiest way to produce a machine capable of hitting tolerances and producing great surface finishes.</p>
<h2 id="steel-beams">Steel Beams</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/steel_frame_router.jpg" alt="Steel Frame Router" title="Steel Frame Router"></p>
<p>A Steel frame is a fantastic choice for its high mass and high rigidity. The biggest downsides are that metalworking requires tools that many hobbyists don't have access to, and that steel frames do not damp vibration well.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable cutting, welding, and powder coating steel then you should probably go ahead and build the frame out of steel. Some large surfaces will need to be milled flat to hold linear guides, so make sure you plan everything out before you start welding.</p>
<p>With a steel frame you can hit tight tolerances and cut almost any material. Your machine's primary limitation won't be its frame. See This Old Tony's excellent steel-framed CNC router build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9UA9ZRFwWU">here</a></p>
<h2 id="cast-iron">Cast Iron</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/cast_iron.jpg" alt="Cast Iron Frame" title="A CNC machine with cast iron frame"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes very often have frames made of cast iron for its superior vibration damping, extreme rigidity, and reduced part count by combining many parts together into a single casting.</p>
<p>This technique requires a tremendous amount of pre-planning, experience, and access to a metal foundry. It is prohibitively expensive and difficult for most hobbyists, but it produces some of the finest CNC machines that can be produced.</p>
<p>Other disadvantages are that cast iron parts can easily rust in open air or corrode if attacked with solvents. Cast parts generally need to be sand blasted and painted to survive industrial environments.</p>
<p>The casting process does not leave you with precision surfaces, so surface machining will be required on any parts that must be within a specified tolerance.</p>
<p>There is significant upfront engineering cost to produce the required molds, but once you have molds the per-unit cost of casting can be cost competitive. If you are designing an extremely high quality CNC router specifically to be mass produced and sold to others, consider cast iron for your frame.</p>
<h2 id="epoxy-granite">Epoxy Granite</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/epoxy_granite.webp" alt="Epoxy Granite Frame" title="A CNC machine with epoxy granite frame"></p>
<p>An exotic choice for frame building is epoxy granite--crushed up natural granite suspended in an epoxy binder that you cast into whatever shape you want, at room temperature.</p>
<p>The advantages of epoxy granite are that it is very dimensionally stable, it is resistent to chemical solvents, it does not require painting, and it can damp vibrations up to 30 times better than an equivalent steel frame, or 10 times better than cast iron. Epoxy granite can be cast into any shape you like using only at-home equipment and techniques. Pre-made threaded inserts and linear guides can be inserted at casting time, greatly reducing the need for machine finishing the final cast parts. For ultra high precision builds, epoxy granite is a fantastic choice.</p>
<p>The disdvantages are that epoxy granite has low tensile strength, and generally needs to be quite thick in all parts of the frame.</p>
<p>Epoxy granite is a rare choice among hobbyists, but I believe it is mostly because the design and build process are so foreign. Frames made from steel beams are easy to visualize and intuitive to link together. Frames made from cast material require a very different design approach that is just not well understood by most hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you are really looking to build an incredibly high performance machine, especially if you plan to make many machines, epoxy granite might be a good choice for you.</p>
<hr>

<p>The role of the linear guide is to constrain movement onto a single axis, preventing any unwanted rotation or deflection. These are often some of the most expensive parts on a CNC router.</p>
<h2 id="box-ways-or-dovetail-ways">Box Ways or Dovetail Ways</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/dovetail_ways.jpg" alt="Dovetail Ways" title="Dovetail ways"></p>
<p>Mills and lathes generally use box ways or dovetail ways, which are precision machined surfaces floating over each other on a microscopically thin film of oil, kept tight with a small insert called a gibbs. When kept clean of damaging debris and maintained properly with oil, ways <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdoUjynpEk&amp;t=125">do not wear whatsoever</a> and will last longer than every other part of the machine.</p>
<p>Ways have the advantage of a huge contact area, allowing vibrations to couple very effectively across the linear guide and into the frame. This allows vibrational energy to spread out through the entire machine body where it can be dampened effectively.</p>
<p>They carry the secondary advantage of being extremely massive, which helps reduce the amplitude of vibrations. Ways are the most rigid linear guides available. In mills or lathes the ways can be ground directly into the body of the machine, reducing assembly complexity and part count.</p>
<p>Despite all these advantages they are almost never incorporated into CNC routers because they are too expensive per unit length, their large mass makes them unweildy, and their wear patterns are not a good match for computer controlled machining.</p>
<p>The issue with wear is that if a small problem does develop on the ways, it can quickly cascade into a serious issue that causes further damage. Repairing ways, especially in situ, is a tremendously tedious and therefore expensive process. A human machinist is likely to notice such problems developing on a manual mill, but the computer operating a CNC mill will not notice.</p>
<p>In contrast all following linear guides are cheap and easy to replace when worn.</p>
<h2 id="supported-shafts">Supported Shafts</h2>
<p><img src="https://mattferraro.dev/images/supported_shafts.jpg" alt="Supported Shaft linear guides" title="Supported Shafts"></p>
<p>Supported shafts are precision ground steel with aluminum support structure underneath that allows you to fix the shaft firmly to the frame of the CNC machine. The linear bearings that run on the shaft are free to rotate about 20 degrees back and forth on the long axis of the shaft, meaning they actually offer two distinct degrees of freedom, one of which must be further …</p></div></div>

			<h2>What is Colorize?</h2>
			<p>Colorize is a website that turns any word or phrase into a hex color.  It works by using a search engine to find image results for the word or phrase, and then finding the average color across the approximately 25 image results.  Because of this, there's usually a small delay when a word is searched for the first time.</p>

			<h2>What would I use it for?</h2>
			<p>If you've ever been drawing in Photoshop and thought 'What color is the sky', or have been designing a website and looking for that perfect 'purple' color, or just wanted to know what color sand is, Colorize is the tool for you.</p>
