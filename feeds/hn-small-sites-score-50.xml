<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git snapped his fingers.  A hobgoblin entered the room and ate the novice
alive.  In the afterlife, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s5-the-long-and-short-of-it"><a href="#s5-the-long-and-short-of-it">The Long and Short of It</a></h2>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#blinding-yourself">genuine randomized control trials on yourself</a></li>
<li>Buy research
<ul>
<li>See <a href="#appendix-sources-of-research">Appendix</a>, <a href="https://blog.alexa.com/sites-for-market-research/">here</a>, or <a href="https://web.jinfo.com/go/blog/73431">here</a></li>
<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
<li>If you can use the gathering to bootstrap a group chat or community, so much the better!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone just as an excuse to make yourself complete a project
<ul>
<li>Sure you could proofread your own document.  But if you hire a proofreader, you have to actually deliver them something at some point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Just ask for things
<ul>
<li>Free upgrades</li>
<li>Coupons
<ul>
<li>At checkout you can just ask “Do you have any coupons I can apply to this?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raises</li>
<li>Better terms in a job offer
<ul>
<li>Easier than asking for a raise - you have more leverage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waiving admission or graduation requirements</li>
<li>It’s okay if the things are crazy.  You can always mollify afterward by saying “I know that’s a crazy thing to ask for, but I have a rule that I always ask.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Buy goods/services from your friends
<ul>
<li>It’s not weird unless you make it weird</li>
<li>Everyone knows some starving artists and needs to buy holiday gifts</li>
<li>Doesn’t apply to every service obviously: don’t take out loans from your friends</li>
</ul>

December 22, 2020 | https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/alignment/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/alignment/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Should you work hard? Depending on your definition of "hard," it's a
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504" target="_blank">controversial question</a>. Let's assume a
baseline level of hardness is roughly 40 hours per week of mostly focused work.
In other words, this is your typical "good employee" at a 9-to-5: they do their
time and they do good work, then they go home and focus on other things. This
is very respectable.</p><p>What about going above and beyond? There are two sides to this. Bronnie Ware
says that one of the top five <a href="https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/" target="_blank">regrets of the
dying</a> is "I wish I
hadn't worked so hard":</p><blockquote>
<p>This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's
youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But
as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been
breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of
their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.</p>
</blockquote><p>On the other hand, we can probably all think of several highly successful people
who worked more than 40 hours per week. My favorite example is Henry Eyring, the
chemist. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2300985.Mormon_Scientist" target="_blank">His
biography</a> is one
of the few books I've read twice, and he's one of my personal role models. He
was ambitious, worked extremely hard and achieved a lot—but he did this without
compromising on anything more important. He was a good husband, father, teacher
and leader. He touched the lives of many.</p><p>There are additional arguments for both sides of the debate. But what's the
resolution to this paradox? I think it's something that I've started calling
"alignment." Alignment is the situation in which there's a high correlation
between the effort you put into life and the good that comes out. In other
words, it's when your work is aligned with what's most important.</p><p>I hypothesize that the real problem with many of Bronnie
Ware's patients wasn't that they worked too hard—the problem is that they
worked too hard on things that, at the end of the day, weren't as important to
them as they thought. Notice that the #1 regret was "I wish I'd had the
courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
Perhaps the regret of working too hard was really just a symptom of this deeper
regret.</p><p>If you want to spend your life working really hard, it's critical to mould
yourself and your situation until working hard is actually worth it. Otherwise
you have two bad choices:</p><ul>
<li>Work hard and later regret that you neglected more important things</li>
<li>Don't work hard and later regret that you didn't fulfill your dreams</li>
</ul><p>I really like <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">Sam Altman's
advice</a> on "how to
achieve outlier success." I think it describes well this idea of alignment:</p><p>(Update since this got on HN and some people are taking issue with part of the quote:
read the whole post, or at least the opening two paragraphs, the footnote, and the
parts of the quote I ellided.)</p><blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone I've ever met would be well-served by spending more time
thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right
thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on
stuff that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small
handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving
person who is very successful. ...</p>
<p>You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart
or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th
percentile requires both.... Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs,
and it's perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of
advantages. ... And it's often really fun. One of the great joys in life is
finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact
matters to something larger than yourself.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear to me why working hard has become a Bad Thing in
certain parts of the US.... I think people who pretend you can be super
successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of
your life) are doing a disservice.</p>
<p>One more thought about working hard: do it at the beginning of your career. Hard
work compounds like interest, and the earlier you do it, the more time you have
for the benefits to pay off.</p>
</blockquote><p>I've had several different experiences with alignment over the past six years:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>For a large, early chunk of my mission, I was completely out of alignment.
I didn't enjoy being a missionary at all—it was a living hell—and it seemed
like our efforts didn't make a difference anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I changed a lot partway through my mission. One of the things I most enjoyed
about the end of my mission was the satisfaction of working hard all day, every
day on something that mattered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although my experience at BYU was positive overall, there was lots of
pressure from the system to work very hard, even though a large chunk of my
time was spent on things that didn't contribute to my education (this
category includes a lot of homework, most lectures, and almost all exams).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being an employee was alright. I went in with the desire to make a real
contribution to Lucid and I like to think I achieved that goal. Although it
wasn't the work I wanted to spend the rest of my life on, I did learn a lot
and the money I saved up is a great benefit to me now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that I've quit my job and have become a startup founder, it's
the first time since my mission where
I feel that I have perfect alignment. I work a
lot, but it doesn't feel like work. I don't look forward to the weekends
anymore; I love every day. Things will get more stressful as we progress, but
I'm excited.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>For me, having alignment means being a startup founder because I'm ambitious and
there are specific things I want to build—I'm not satisfied by working on
whatever the company that hired me happens to be building. But all that being
said, alignment is important for everyone, regardless of what your individual
goals and desires are. As with most <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things" target="_blank">hard
things</a>,
there's no formula for alignment. You have to figure out what it means for you
and how to get it. But being aware of the concept is at least the first step.</p><p>I write this all as a reminder to myself. I hope my life never falls out
of alignment.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>STOCKHOLM — Sweden is rethinking its security, and whether it really is safest outside NATO.</p>



<p>Two years out from the next election, debate over whether to join the Western defense alliance is intensifying, setting up a left-versus-right clash on the question in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current minority government of Social Democrats and Greens — plus their allies the Left Party — remain staunchly against, citing the value of neutrality in what they see as a polarizing world.</p>



<p>On the other side, four traditionally allied center-right parties — the Moderate Party, the Liberals, the Center Party and the Christian Democrats — are in favor, saying Sweden needs the security of the defense guarantees that NATO membership offers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pro-NATO side scored a big win last week when the far-right Sweden Democrats, who are angling for closer cooperation with the center-right bloc in a range of policy areas, reversed a previous anti-NATO stance and backed a motion for Sweden to adopt a so-called NATO option — allowing it to join NATO at some point in the future.&nbsp;Parliament voted in favor of the motion by 204 votes to 145.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Issues of defense don’t normally sit high on the agenda in elections here, but since the Sweden Democrats have now moved their position, we could well see more interest,” said Allan Widman, a lawmaker with the Liberal Party and spokesman on defense policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting a “NATO option” is not a commitment to join — Finland has had such an option since 1995 and remains outside the pact — but is widely seen as a movement in that direction. The government has acknowledged as much by so far refusing to act on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign Minister Ann Linde called parliamentary backing for the move “a significant negative event for Swedish security.”</p>



<p>For Sweden, joining NATO would be a big policy shift, as it would end more than 200 years of official military neutrality. The country has not formally taken sides in a war since Napoleon was advancing across Europe, and has over recent years sought to carve out a diplomatic role as an impartial international arbiter while at the same time developing a closer partnership with NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swedish NATO membership would also shake up a delicate balance of power in the volatile Baltic Sea region, where officially unaligned Sweden and Finland and NATO members Denmark, Germany, Poland and the Baltic states regularly face off against Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August, Sweden <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/security-alert-sweden-gotland-cold-war-memories/" target="_blank">deployed</a> troops to its Baltic island of Gotland after a security scare triggered by Russian warships sailing close to the island.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian military jets regularly enter Swedish airspace without permission and many pointed the finger at Russia when a mysterious submarine was detected in waters close to the capital Stockholm in 2014.</p>



<p>Analysts say that last week’s vote in the Swedish parliament on the NATO option likely signals the start of a new phase in the wrangling over full entry into the alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can now expect a more comprehensive political debate about an eventual Swedish membership,” Calle Håkansson, an analyst at the think tank the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told public service television.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arguments of both sides are already clear. The Social Democrats’ resistance is based on a long-held belief that Sweden’s “freedom from alliances,” as the party calls it, has served the country well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist has engineered a range of joint training exercises with NATO, such as the cold weather <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shape.nato.int/news-archive/2019/nato-allies-participate-in-swedish-exercise-northern-wind" target="_blank">exercise </a>Northern Wind in Sweden in March 2019, but at every turn, he has sought to underline Swedish independence.</p>



<p>The Social Democrats say that joining NATO would represent unnecessary antagonization of Russia, and risk destabilizing an already tense security situation along Europe’s eastern flank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t want to go down a road of security policy experiments or adventurism,” Hulqvist <a href="https://www.dn.se/debatt/m-tycks-vara-ensidigt-fokuserade-pa-nato-medlemskap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> in an editorial in August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Widman, of the pro-NATO Liberals, said Sweden’s strategy has left it in a security “no-man’s land,” viewed by Russia as part of the “European security system” but lacking the guarantee of the NATO members’ commitment to mutual defense.</p>



<p>“That is a very dangerous position to find yourself in,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While public support for NATO membership in Finland has remained low and steady, in Sweden it has been rising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research by Gothenburg University’s SOM Institute <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2020-06/7.%20Swedish%20trends%20%281986-2019%29_v2.pdf" target="_blank">shows</a> roughly equal support (around 30 percent) for joining NATO as those opposed. In 1994, when the SOM Institute began researching the question, 48 percent said joining was a bad idea versus 15 percent in favor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How the issue develops will depend on the rival sides’ abilities to convince voters ahead of the 2022 vote. If the pro-NATO side does well at the polls and knock the minority center-left incumbents out of power, they could push for a referendum on the question, experts say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson has previously said that he believes Sweden will be a member of NATO before the decade is out and he called the NATO option vote “historic.” In a social media <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIkl1Cdp4IU/" target="_blank">post</a>, he said it would allow Sweden to “update and modernize” its security stance and tell the world that Sweden is ready to join NATO at a future point of its choosing.</p>



<p>“A government can’t just look away from a parliamentary majority view in a foreign policy or security question,” he said. “We expect the government to get behind the parliament’s security policy line.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Decisions have always been hard for me, especially when I'm overwhelmed. For example, I break down in front of restaurants because I can't decide if I want to go in or pick a different restaurant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Between working remotely and social distancing, I have spent a lot of time alone this year. The hardest part is needing to make way more decisions for myself. I have to decide when to get up, what to eat, what to work on, and what to do with my free time. Sure, these were largely in my control before, but I relied a lot on social pressure to choose.</span></p>
<p><span>When I was researching </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aslawrence/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Adam</span></a><span> for </span><a href="https://boringstartupstuff.com/newsletter/dec-8th-2020-mastering-the-art-of-the-playbook" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>our interview</span></a><span>, I found his user guide </span><span></span><span>and decided to write one for myself. Both his and the one from the original </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-indispensable-document-for-the-modern-manager/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>First Round Review piece</span></a><span> are written from the perspective of a manager, but user guides can be just as helpful for individual contributors. The point is sharing how best to work with you, which is especially important at a time when fewer teams are in-person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I created a template (</span><a href="https://www.notion.so/thekatieharper/User-Guide-Outline-e3130055035b455bab61c5400e96e66c" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>which you can copy here</span></a><span>) and then got stuck. Every bullet point represents a decision that I need to make about myself. My startup job requires me to make decisions constantly, and I actually enjoy that process. But I feel entirely different when it’s a personal decision.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>User guides are essentially a branding exercise, and I worry that I will get called a liar for my choices. I brand myself as a morning person, a proactive doer, and a workaholic. But I’m writing this at night, at the last minute, having spent all weekend </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> working (though also somehow not relaxing). Are my stories based on truth or aspiration?</span></p>
<p><span>Decisions also open us up to rejection. By listing my preferences, personality traits, and pet peeves, I’m publishing a quick way to judge me. What if someone sees this and doesn’t want to work with me?</span></p>
<p><span>Often decisions feel selfish to me. When I decide what time of day I prefer meetings, I feel guilty for prioritizing my own wants over someone else’s. Writing a user guide forces you to confront the stories you tell about yourself. And you have to be vulnerable enough that people will actually learn something useful from reading what you write.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A year ago I was in a relationship with someone who never decided anything. Now I see that </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> deciding was selfish. And I don’t want to be that way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the end, this piece is my user guide, because it says more about me than a checklist can.</span></p>

<p>Learn how to configure K3s on bare-metal to run a Kubernetes cluster with just as much resilience and fault tolerance as a managed service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tutorial is a follow-on from my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/kubernetes-in-10-minutes/">Kubernetes on bare-metal in 10 minutes</a> from 2017. The original post focused on getting <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> working across a number of bare-metal hosts running Ubuntu, and then it went on to deploy a microservice and the dashboard. It was a primer, and written to help new users kick the tires with Kubernetes. It used production-ready kubeadm, but only used one master node, meaning it couldn't tolerate a failure.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to provide you with a HA, production-ready cluster on bare-metal infrastructure. We will use <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal</a> for the hosts, automate the boring parts, but do the rest step by step, so that you can get an understanding on what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, we will review the setup and discuss other options for running on-premises or in a homelab with Raspberry Pis. We will also compare kube-vip to other solutions for bare-metal and self-hosted networking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conceptual diagram: kubectl access provided by the stable EIP. The IngressController also has an EIP which  routes traffic for services exposed with Ingress such as the OpenFaaS gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post also moves from kubeadm to using <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a> (a <a href="https://cncf.io/">CNCF</a> project), which requires fewer resources for its control-plane and has a built-in HA mode using embedded <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a>. K3s has been generally available (GA) and production ready since 2019.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
<p>We will use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> to create the nodes on <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal (aka Packet)</a> servers, k3s to create a HA control-plane, and <a href="https://kube-vip.io/">kube-vip</a> to configure a HA IP address for the API server.</p>
<p>The setup will be able to tolerate at least one failure of a server. So unlike the 2017 post, our servers will form a HA cluster, and will also have an Elastic IP (EIP) configured so that the Kubernetes API server will remain accessible if one or more of the servers becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>In a Kubernetes cluster, the Cloud Controller Manager add-on has several responsibilities including node management, routing and managing services. At the end of the tutorial, not only will your cluster have a HA control-plane, a stable IP for the API Server, but Equinix Metal's (CCM) will also allow you to expose services as type LoadBalancer. Each IP address costs around 3.25 USD / mo, you can find out more details on the IP Addresses section of the dashboard.</p>
<p>Skill level: intermediate to advanced. You should be familiar with Kubernetes, networking and public cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="installtheprerequisites">Install the pre-requisites</h3>
<p>Download <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a>, a portable Kubernetes marketplace and downloader for DevOps CLIs. It will be used to download the tools we need for the tutorial. You are of course welcome to do things the hard way, if you prefer.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLS https://dl.get-arkade.dev | sh

# Install the binary using the command given as output, such as: 
sudo cp arkade-darwin /usr/local/bin/arkade

# Or on Linux:
sudo cp arkade /usr/local/bin/arkade
</code></pre>
<p>Download the following CLIS:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kubectl</code> - the Kubernetes CLI</li>
<li><code>k3sup</code> - a k3s installer that works over SSH</li>
<li><code>terraform</code> - an Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool, which we'll used to create the initial hosts</li>
<li><code>kubectx</code> - a fast way to check and switch your Kubernetes context between clusters</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>arkade get kubectl
arkade get k3sup
arkade get terraform
arkade get kubectx
</code></pre>
<p>Follow the step to put these binaries into your PATH:</p>
<pre><code># Add (k3sup) to your PATH variable
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.arkade/bin/
</code></pre>
<h3 id="provisionyournodes">Provision your nodes</h3>
<p>We will use terraform to provision three servers and two agents. You can alter these numbers, but three is the minimum number required for K3s' built-in HA mode using etcd.</p>
<p>You may well ask why the entire blog post isn't just a single Terraform command. I can hear you Hacker News. This point of this post isn't to do all the work for you, but to help you understand what is required, and in what order. Creating hosts is boring, so we are going to automate that and save you some time.</p>
<p>Save <code>main.tfvars</code> with the following:</p>
<pre><code>terraform {
  required_providers {
    packet = {
      source = "terraform-providers/packet"
      version = "~&gt; 3.2.1"
    }
  }
  required_version = "&gt;= 0.13"
}

variable "api_token" {
  description = "Equinix Metal API token"
}

variable "project_id" {
  description = "Equinix Metal Project ID"
}

variable "servers" {
  description = "Count of servers"
}

variable "agents" {
  description = "Count of agents"
}

provider "packet" {
  auth_token=var.api_token
}

resource "packet_ssh_key" "key1" {
  name       = "k3sup-1"
  public_key = file("/home/alex/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

resource "packet_device" "k3s-server" {
  count		         = var.servers
  hostname         = "k3s-server-${count.index+1}"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities       = ["ams1"]
  operating_system = "ubuntu_20_10"
  billing_cycle    = "hourly"
  project_id       = var.project_id
  depends_on       = [packet_ssh_key.key1]
}

resource "packet_device" "k3s-agent" {
  count 	         = var.agents
  hostname         = "k3s-agent-${count.index+1}"
  plan             = "c1.small.x86"
  facilities       = ["ams1"]
  operating_system = "ubuntu_20_10"
  billing_cycle    = "hourly"
  project_id       = var.project_id
  depends_on       = [packet_ssh_key.key1]
}

output "server_ips" {
  value = packet_device.k3s-server.*.access_public_ipv4
}

output "agent_ips" {
  value = packet_device.k3s-agent.*.access_public_ipv4
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then create <code>main.tfvars</code></p>
<pre><code>api_token   =   ""
project_id  =   ""
servers     =   3
agents      =   2
</code></pre>
<p>Edit <code>api_token</code> and <code>project_id</code> with the values from the Equinix Metal dashboard. The API key is found on your user profile.</p>
<p>If you wish to change the size of the nodes, you can edit <code>c1.small.x86</code> and use a different value. You can find the options in your dashboard.</p>
<p>Now run the terraform to create the hosts:</p>
<pre><code>terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=main.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=main.tfvars
</code></pre>
<p>When the hosts have been created, you'll get output with your IP addresses.</p>
<pre><code>agent_ips = [
  "147.75.81.203",
  "147.75.33.3",
]
server_ips = [
  "147.75.32.35",
  "147.75.80.83",
  "147.75.32.99",
]
</code></pre>
<p>Open a terminal and write environment variables for each:</p>
<pre><code>export SERVER1=""
export SERVER2=""
export SERVER3=""

export AGENT1=""
export AGENT2=""
</code></pre>
<p>Save this file as <code>hosts.txt</code> as you may need it again later.</p>
<h3 id="obtainanipaddressforthecontrolplane">Obtain an IP address for the control-plane</h3>
<p>K3s can run in a HA mode, where a failure of a master node can be tolerated. This isn't enough for public-facing clusters, where a stable IP address for the Kubernetes control-plane is required.</p>
<p>We need a stable IP for port 6443, which we could also call an Elastic IP or EIP. Fortunately BGP can help us there. One of our three master nodes will advertise its IP address as the route for the EIP, then if it goes down, another will start advertising. This means our clients can always depend on a stable address of: <code>https://$EIP:6443</code> for connecting to the Kubernetes API server.</p>
<p>Obtain an IP address from your EM dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IPs &amp; Networks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request IP Address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the same region that you'll use for the nodes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a <code>/32</code> for a single IP for the control-plane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may take some time for an engineer to approve the request.</p>
<p>Once you have the IP, set it in an environment variable:</p>
<pre><code>export EIP="147.75.100.237"
</code></pre>
<p>Add this line to <code>hosts.txt</code> so that you have it, if you need it later.</p>
<h3 id="enablebgpforeachserver">Enable BGP for each server</h3>
<p>Click on each server in the Equinix Metal dashboard. Click on its details page, then BGP. Find the Manage button on the IPv4 row and click "Enable BGP".</p>
<p>This setting allows BGP to be advertised from this server.</p>
<h3 id="provisionthefirstmaster">Provision the first master</h3>
<p>For various reasons, we can only set up kube-vip after K3s has started, so we will create the first master node:</p>
<pre><code>k3sup install \
  --ip $SERVER1 \
  --tls-san $EIP \
  --cluster \
  --k3s-channel latest \
  --k3s-extra-args "--no-deploy servicelb --disable-cloud-controller" \
  --merge \
  --local-path $HOME/.kube/config \
  --context=em-ha-k3s
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>--tls-san</code> is required to advertise the EIP, so that K3s will create a valid certificate for the API server.</li>
<li>the <code>--k3s-channel</code> is specifying the latest version of K3s, which in this instance will be 1.19, by the time you run this tutorial, it may have changed, in which can you can give <code>1.19</code> as the channel, or a specific version with <code>--k3s-version</code></li>
<li>note the <code>--cluster</code> flag, which tells the server to use etcd to create a cluster for the servers we will join later on</li>
<li><code>--local-path</code>, <code>--context</code> and <code>--merge</code> all allow us to merge the KUBECONFIG from the K3s to our local file.</li>
<li>in <code>--k3s-extra-args</code> we disable the built-in K3s service load-balancer, and also disable the cloud-controller, because we will use the Equinix Metal Cloud Controller Manager instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now check your kubeconfig file is pointing at the right cluster:</p>
<pre><code>kubectx em-ha-k3s
</code></pre>
<p>Try querying the nodes in the cluster:</p>
<pre><code>[alex@nuc ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS     ROLES         AGE   VERSION
k3s-server-1   Ready      etcd,master   7s    v1.19.5+k3s2
</code></pre>
<p>Apply the RBAC so that kube-vip can access the Kubernetes API and configure services:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl apply -f https://kube-vip.io/manifests/rbac.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Now log into the first server using SSH. There is a one-time configuration option required for each server.</p>
<pre><code>ssh root@$SERVER1

ctr image pull docker.io/plndr/kube-vip:0.3.0

alias kube-vip="ctr run --rm --net-host docker.io/plndr/kube-vip:0.3.0"
export INTERFACE=lo
export EIP="147.75.100.237"

kube-vip vip /kube-vip manifest daemonset \
  --interface $INTERFACE \
  --vip $EIP \
  --controlplane \
  --services \
  --inCluster \
  --taint \
  --bgp \
  --packet \
  --provider-config /etc/cloud-sa/cloud-sa.json | tee /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/vip.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>The manifest for kube-vip will be created at <code>/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/vip.yaml</code>, any files placed here will be run by K3s.</p>
<p>Log out of the server</p>

December 22, 2020 | https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/778-Don%E2%80%99t_think%2C_just_defunctionalize | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/778-Don%E2%80%99t_think%2C_just_defunctionalize">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: CPS-conversion and defunctionalization can help you to come up with a constant-stack algorithm.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Turns out I inadvertedly plagiarized the talk <a href="https://t.co/YlN0MOnN83?amp=1">The Best Refactoring You’ve Never Heard Of</a> by James Koppel. Please consider this a form of sincere flattery.</p>
<h3 id="the-starting-point">The starting point</h3>
<p>Today, I’ll take you on a another little walk through the land of program transformations. Let’s begin with a simple binary tree, with value of unknown type in the leaves, as well as the canonical <code>map</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>T</span> a <span>=</span> <span>L</span> a <span>|</span> <span>B</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> a)

<span>map1 ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map1 f (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
map1 f (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (map1 f t1) (map1 f t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, this <code>map</code> function is using the program stack as it traverses the tree. Our goal is now to come up with a <code>map</code> function that does <em>not</em> use the stack!</p>
<p>Why? Good question! In Haskell, there wouldn’t be a strong need for this, as the Haskell stack is allocated on the heap, just like your normal data, so there is plenty of stack space. But in other languages or environments, the stack space may have a hard limit, and it may be advised to not use unbounded stack space.</p>
<p>That aside, it’s a fun exercise, and that’s sufficient reason for me.</p>
<p>(In the following, I assume that tail-calls, i.e. those where a function end with another function call, but without modifying its result, do not actually use stack space. Once <em>all</em> recursive function calls are tail calls, the code is equivalent to an imperative loop, as we will see.)</p>
<h3 id="think">Think?</h3>
<p>We <em>could</em> now just stare at the problem (rather the code), and try to come up with a solution directly. We’d probably think “ok, as I go through the tree, I have to remember all the nodes <em>above</em> me… so I need a list of those nodes… and for each of these nodes, I also need to remember whether I am currently processing the left child, and yet have to look at the right one, or whether I am done with the left child… so what do I have to remember about the current node…?”</p>
<p>… ah, my brain spins already. Maybe eventually I figure it out, but why think when we can <em>derive</em> the solution? So let’s start with above <code>map1</code>, and rewrite it, in several, mechanical, steps into a stack-less, tail-recursive solution.</p>
<h3 id="go">Go!</h3>
<p>Before we set out, let me rewrite the <code>map</code> function using a local <code>go</code> helper, as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map2 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map2 f t <span>=</span> go t
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>L</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>L</span> (f x)
    go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) <span>=</span> <span>B</span> (go t1) (go t2)</code></pre></div>
<p>This transformation (effectively the “static argument transformation”) has the nice advantage that we do not have to pass <code>f</code> around all the time, and that when we copy the function, I only have to change the top-level name, but not the names of the inner functions.</p>
<p>Also, I find it more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="cps">CPS</h3>
<p>A blunt, effective tool to turn code that is not yet using tail-calls into code that only uses tail-calls is use <em>continuation-passing style</em>. If we have a function of type <code>… -&gt; t</code>, we turn it into a function of type <code>… -&gt; (t -&gt; r) -&gt; r</code>, where <code>r</code> is the type of the result we want at the very end. This means the function now receives an extra argument, often named <code>k</code> for continuation, and instead of returning some <code>x</code>, the function calls <code>k x</code>.</p>
<p>We can apply this to our <code>go</code> function. Here, both <code>t</code> and <code>r</code> happen to be <code>T b</code>; the type of finished trees:</p>
<pre><code>map3 :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
map3 f t = go t (\r -&gt; r)
  where
    go :: T a -&gt; (T b -&gt; T b) -&gt; T b
    go (L x) k  = k (L (f x))
    go (B t1 t2) k  = go t1 (\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></pre>
<p>Note that when initially call <code>go</code>, we pass the identity function <code>(\r -&gt; r)</code> as the initial continuation.</p>
<p>Alas, suddenly all function calls are in tail position, and this codes does not use stack space! Technically, we are done, although it is not quite satisfying; all these lambdas floating around obscure the meaning of the code, are maybe a bit slow to execute, and also, we didn’t really learn much yet. This is certainly <em>not</em> the code we would have writing after “thinking hard”.</p>
<h3 id="defunctionalization">Defunctionalization</h3>
<p>So let’s continue rewriting the code to something prettier, simpler. Something that does not use lambdas like this.</p>
<p>Again, there is a mechanical technique that can help it. It likely won't make the code prettier, but it will get rid of the lambdas, so let’s do that an clean up later.</p>
<p>The technique is called <em>defunctionalization</em> (because it replaces functional values by plain data values), and can be seen as a form of <em>refinement</em>.</p>
<p>Note that we pass around vales of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, but we certainly don’t <em>mean</em> the full type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. Instead, only very specific values of that type occur in our program, So let us replace <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code> with a data type that contains representatives of <em>just</em> the values we actually use.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We find at all values of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 (\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2)))</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We create a datatype with one constructor for each of these:</p>

<p>(This is not complete yet.)</p></li>
<li><p>We introduce an <em>interpretation</em> function that turns a <code>K</code> back into a <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>=</span> (<span>*</span> <span>TBD</span> <span>*</span>)</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>In the function <code>go</code>, instead of taking a parameter of type <code>(T b -&gt; T b)</code>, we take a <code>K</code>. And when we actually <em>use</em> the continuation, we have to turn the <code>K</code> back to the function using eval:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>go ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
go (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> eval k (<span>L</span> (f x))
go (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k <span>=</span> go t1 <span>K1</span></code></pre></div>
We also do this to the code fragments identified in the first step; these become:
<ul>
<li><code>(\r -&gt; r)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r1 -&gt; go t2 K2)</code></li>
<li><code>(\r2 -&gt; eval k (B r1 r2))</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now we complete the <code>eval</code> function: For each constructor, we simply map it to the corresponding lambda from step 1:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>eval ::</span> <span>K</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b)
eval <span>I</span> <span>=</span> (\r <span>-&gt;</span> r)
eval <span>K1</span> <span>=</span> (\r1 <span>-&gt;</span> go t2 <span>K2</span>)
eval <span>K2</span> <span>=</span> (\r2 <span>-&gt;</span> eval k (<span>B</span> r1 r2))</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t quite work yet: We have variables on the right hand side that are not bound (<code>t2</code>, <code>r1</code>, <code>k</code>). So let’s add them to the constructors <code>K1</code> and <code>K2</code> as needed. This also changes the type <code>K</code> itself; it now needs to take type parameters.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This leads us to the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>K</span> a b
  <span>=</span> <span>I</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>K1</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>K</span> a b)
  <span>|</span> <span>K2</span> (<span>T</span> b) (<span>K</span> a b)

<span>map4 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b

<p>Not really cleaner or prettier, but everything is still tail-recursive, <em>and</em> we are now working with plain data.</p>
<h3 id="we-like-lists">We like lists</h3>
<p>To clean it up a little bit, we can notice that the <code>K</code> data type really is just a list of values, where the values are either <code>T a</code> or <code>T b</code>. We do not need a custom data type for this! Instead of our <code>K</code>, we can just use the following, built from standard data types:</p>
<pre><code>type K' a b = [Either (T a) (T b)]</code></pre>
<p>Now I replace <code>I</code> with <code>[]</code>, <code>K1 t2 k</code> with <code>Left t2 : k</code> and <code>K2 r1 k</code> with <code>Right r1 : k</code>. I also, very suggestively, rename <code>go</code> to <code>down</code> and <code>eval</code> to <code>up</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map5 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map5 f t <span>=</span> down t []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    down ::</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    down (<span>L</span> x) k  <span>=</span> up k (<span>L</span> (f x))
    down (<span>B</span> t1 t2) k  <span>=</span> down t1 (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)

<span>    up ::</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    up [] r <span>=</span> r
    up (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) r1 <span>=</span> down t2 (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    up (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) r2 <span>=</span> up k (<span>B</span> r1 r2)</code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, the code suddenly makes more sense again. In fact, I can try to verbalize it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we traverse the tree, we have to remember for all parent nodes, whether there is still something <code>Left</code> to do when we come back to it (so we remember a <code>T a</code>), or if we are done with that (so we have a <code>T b</code>). This is the list <code>K' a b</code>.</p>
<p>We begin to go <code>down</code> the left of the tree (noting that the right siblings are still left to do), until we hit a leaf. We transform the leaf, and then go <code>up</code>.</p>
<p>If we go <code>up</code> and hit the root, we are done. Else, if we go <code>up</code> and there is something <code>Left</code> to do, we remember the subtree that we just processed (as that is already in the <code>Right</code> form), and go <code>down</code> the other subtree. But if we go <code>up</code> and there is nothing <code>Left</code> to do, we put the two subtrees together and continue going up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite neat!</p>
<h3 id="the-imperative-loop">The imperative loop</h3>
<p>At this point we could stop: the code is pretty, makes sense, and has the properties we want. But let’s turn the dial a bit further and try to make it an imperative loop.</p>
<p>We know that if we have a single tail-recursive function, then that’s equivalent to a loop, with the function’s parameter turning into mutable variables. But we have two functions!</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have two functions <code>a -&gt; r</code> and <code>b -&gt; r</code> that have the same return type (which they necessarily have here, since we CPS-converted them further up), then those two functions are equivalent to a <em>single</em> function taking “<code>a</code> or <code>b</code>”, i.e. <code>Either a b -&gt; r</code>. This really nothing else than the high-school level algebra rule of <span><em>r</em><sup><em>a</em></sup> ⋅ <em>r</em><sup><em>b</em></sup> = <em>r</em><sup><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></sup></span>.</p>
<p>So (after reordering the arguments of <code>down</code> to put <code>T b</code> first) we can rewrite the code as</p>
<div><pre><code><span>map6 ::</span> forall a b<span>.</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
map6 f t <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t) []
  <span>where</span>
<span>    go ::</span> <span>Either</span> (<span>T</span> a) (<span>T</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>K'</span> a b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>T</span> b
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>L</span> x))     k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>L</span> (f x))) k
    go (<span>Left</span> (<span>B</span> t1 t2)) k        <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t1) (<span>Left</span> t2 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r)  []             <span>=</span> r
    go (<span>Right</span> r1) (<span>Left</span>  t2 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Left</span> t2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k)
    go (<span>Right</span> r2) (<span>Right</span> r1 <span>:</span> k) <span>=</span> go (<span>Right</span> (<span>B</span> r1 r2)) k</code></pre></div>
<p>Do you see the loop yet? If not, maybe it helps to compare it with the following equivalent imperative looking pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>mapLoop :: forall a b. (a -&gt; b) -&gt; T a -&gt; T b
mapLoop f t {
  var node = Left t;
  var parents = [];
  while (true) {
    switch (node) {
      Left (L x) -&gt; node := Right (L (f x))
      Left (B t1 t2) -&gt; node := Left t1; parents.push(Left t2)
      Right r1 -&gt; {
        if (parents.len() == 0) {
          return r1;
        } else {
          switch (parents.pop()) {
            Left t2  -&gt; node := Left t2; parents.push(Right r1);
            Right r2 -&gt; node := Right (B r1 r2)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Greetings fellow Nim adventurers! Below you will find 16 handy Nim tips
&amp; tricks I came across while developing a medium-sized GUI program this year,
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/gridmonger">Gridmonger</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/koi">and</a>
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-riff">related</a>
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-binstreams">libraries</a>).  Some of them are
about less known or undocumented Nim features or standard library functions,
a few are workarounds for some rough edges of the language, and there’s also
a handful of useful techniques I read about in forums or have invented on my
own.</p>

<p>All tips are for Nim 1.4.2 and beyond, and most are applicable to the
C backend. I hope you’ll find something useful here that will make your time
with Nim more enjoyable and productive!</p>

<h2 id="i--the-not-so-obvious">I — The Not-So-Obvious</h2>

<h3 id="1--reducing-executable-size-by-stripping-debug-symbols">1 &nbsp; Reducing executable size by stripping debug symbols</h3>

<p>Nim touts itself as a language capable of generating small native binaries.
But just naively compiling some program with <code>nim c -d:release</code> and looking at
the file sizes will make you wonder about the validity of that claim!</p>

<p>A release build of <a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/gridmonger">Gridmonger</a>
weighs around 12 megs. Anything but small, if you ask me!<sup id="fnref:small" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:small">1</a></sup> Sure, it
statically links <a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-glfw">GLFW</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/johnnovak/nim-nanovg">NanoVG</a> and a bunch of other Nim
libraries, but to put things into perspective, <a href="https://reaper.fm/">REAPER</a> (a
highly-advanced and complex DAW written in C/C++) is about the same size at
~13 megs! Surely, my program is much simpler than REAPER, so what’s going on
here?</p>

<p>It turns out that gcc debug symbols are included in Nim binaries by default,
which can account for a quite substantial 2-to 5-fold size increase! Luckily,
we can remove them easily with the <code>strip</code> command which comes with gcc.</p>

<p>How about trying to optimise for a small executable with <code>--opt:size</code>?  Sure,
that would yield about 30% smaller binaries, but at the expense of some
potential runtime performance loss. So while it might not always be the best
option, but you can always it <em>and</em> strip the debug symbols for even bigger
savings.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re hell-bent on producing smallest possible binary,
compressing it with an executable packer like <a href="https://upx.github.io/">UPX</a>
could be just the ticket.</p>

<p>The below table summarises my findings with some concrete data:</p>

<p>It is important to note that the presence of debug symbols in a binary <em>does
not</em> affect its runtime performance whatsoever. This is because debug symbols
are not even loaded into memory during normal use, only when debugging. So
really it only affects the space the executable takes up on disk.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering, you’ll still get nice Nim stack traces with
a stripped binary if you compiled it with <code>-d:debug</code> or <code>--stacktrace=on
--linetrace=on</code> (more on that in the next tip).</p>

<h3 id="2--release-builds-with-exception-logging">2 &nbsp; Release builds with exception logging</h3>

<p>Creating a release build with <code>-d:release</code> gives you a speed boost, but at
the price of turning off stack traces (among other things). This can be a problem
if you’re trying to implement a crash-reporting mechanism for end-users,
which involves surrounding your main method with a <code>try/except</code> block and
writing exceptions with stack traces to a log file.</p>

<p>Luckily, you don’t need to ship debug builds to your users just to be able to
do that; you can still use <code>-d:release</code> to get most optimisation benefits
while turning stack traces back on with <code>--stacktrace=on --linetrace=on</code>. The
performance of the resulting binary might be a bit slower, but you know, life
is all about the right trade-offs.</p>

<h3 id="3--switching-to-arcorc">3 &nbsp; Switching to ARC/ORC</h3>

<p>Nim defaults to the <code>refc</code> garbage collector (deferred reference counting with
a mark &amp; sweep phase for cycle collection), which works very well, even for
soft-realtime requirements. But did you know that there has been a brand new
GC introduced in 1.2.x that offers reduced memory footprint and even better
performance in most cases?</p>

<p>This is ARC, the fully deterministic Automatic Reference Counting garbage
collector. Switching to ARC is as easy as supplying the <code>--gc:arc</code> option to
the compiler. It’s a drop-in replacement for most programs. Depending on your
program, you might want to use it with the <code>--deepcopy:on
--hint[Performance]:off</code> options.</p>

<p>ARC has many other benefits, including hard realtime support, shared heaps
between threads, and simplifying the C FFI.  Mind you, ARC cannot handle
cyclic data structures. But it has a big brother called ORC, which adds support
for that.</p>

<p>You can learn more about ARC and ORC in this <a href="https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/15/introduction-to-arc-orc-in-nim.html">excellent blog
post</a>
on the Nim website.</p>

<h3 id="4--executable-icons-on-windows-mingw">4 &nbsp; Executable icons on Windows (MinGW)</h3>

<p>Setting the icon for Windows executables is probably easier with Visual
Studio, but anyhow, here are the instructions for gcc/MinGW that I’m using.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, you’ll need to generate an <code>.ico</code> file that contains your icon image
in multiple resolutions. There’s lots of online tools for that, and there’s
also ImageMagick—this is outside the scope of this article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have your image, you’ll need to create a resource definition <code>.rc</code>
file that references your icon file. I used <code>appicon</code> here for the ID, but
you can use any other string, it doesn’t matter:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> appicon ICON "gridmonger.ico"
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next step is to create the resource object file from the <code>.rc</code> file
(<code>windres</code> is included in MinGW):</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> windres gridmonger.rc -O coff -o gridmonger.res
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we need to instruct the compiler to link the resource file
into our program:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code> <span>when</span> <span>defined</span><span>(</span><span>windows</span><span>):</span>
   <span>{.</span><span>link</span><span>:</span> <span>"icons/gridmonger.res"</span><span>.}</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="5--debug-echo-in-windows-gui-programs-mingw">5 &nbsp; Debug echo in Windows GUI programs (MinGW)</h3>

<p>This will be a rather short one but it took me a while to figure it out. It
turns out that when you link against the Windows libraries by passing
<code>-mwindows</code> to the linker (<code>-L:-mwindows</code>), you won’t be able to print stuff
the console with <code>echo</code> anymore.</p>

<p>“But this is a useless tip, of course you need to link against the Windows
libs in a GUI program!”, I hear you say. Well, not necessarily. In GLFW apps,
for example, you can get away with not linking against the Windows libs in
many cases. For instance, in Gridmonger I only need <code>-mwindows</code> so I can open
the standard open and save system dialogs. In my debug builds, I don’t link
against the Windows libs and I conditionally turn the calls to the dialog
functions to no-ops, and then I can do my debug printing to the console.</p>



<h3 id="6--using-keyword">6 &nbsp; ‘using’ keyword</h3>

<p>The
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#statements-and-expressions-using-statement">using</a>
keyword is a very useful, but often forgotten language feature. It helps to
cut down on redundancy when creating method call style APIs, or when passing

<h3 id="7--opening-urls-in-the-default-browser">7 &nbsp; Opening URLs in the default browser</h3>

<p>Did you know that the standard library has
a <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/browsers.html">browsers</a> module for the sole
purpose of opening URLs in the OS default browser in a cross-platform way?
In fact, I’ve been using Nim for 4 years and I’ve learned about this just
recently!</p>

<p>This is very handy if you want to navigate the user to a program’s website
from a desktop app, or to open local HTML documentation.</p>

<h3 id="8--cross-platform-home-and-config-directories">8 &nbsp; Cross-platform home and config directories</h3>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html#getHomeDir">getHomeDir()</a> and
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html#getConfigDir">getConfigDir()</a> from the
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html">os</a> module are super handy if you need to
handle configuration files or program data in a cross-platform way.</p>

<h3 id="9--debug-dumping-expressions">9 &nbsp; Debug dumping expressions</h3>

<p>However sophisticated modern development tools might be, just echoing stuff to
the console is still one of the easiest and quickest ways to debug a program.
But writing things like <code>echo "foo: ", foo</code> for the hundredth time gets old
really fast. The <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/sugar.html#dump.m%2Cuntyped">dump</a>
macro in the standard <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/sugar.html">sugar</a> module
helps with exactly that.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out the other useful additions the module introduces!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>sugar</span>

<span>var</span>
  <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span>
  <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>"frobnicate"</span>
  <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span>

<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>

<span># prints:</span>
<span># a = 42</span>
<span># s = frobnicate</span>
<span># a + x = 49</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="10--measuring-elapsed-time">10 &nbsp; Measuring elapsed time</h3>

<p>Although you can use the regular <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/times.html">times</a>
module to measure elapsed time, to do it properly you really need a monotonic
timer. Such a thing has been added to the standard library recently in the
form of <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/monotimes.html">std/monotimes</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Some people are not satisfied with a webcam from their notebook or an old webcam
they bought many years ago.</p>
<p>My brother decided he wants to try streaming. Some people can just do a thing
and other people want to research all the bits and pieces beforehand. Our chat
history is comparable in length to all my other chats combined, so I learned a
lot of it as well. The craft is full with small details and inconveniences.</p>
<p>He found that there are basically no good webcams. A lot of the time an image
quality is meh, and the rare presence of 4k is usually not better than 1080p,
because resolution is not quality. Some camera apparently does upscaling from
1080p to 4k in its driver, indicated by poor quality and high CPU load. He also
has a really good camera, Fujifilm X-T1. It can't be used as a webcam when
connected to a USB port. Usually it's possible to buy an HDMI-to-USB converter,
but his camera can't output a live stream into HDMI, only a recorded video.</p>
<p>So we had an idea — maybe it is possible to create a good webcam
ourselves. Would anybody care? Well, it’s almost 2021 now, streaming is still on
the rise, pandemic is going strong and video meetings are everywhere. People are
willing to spend some money, as indicated by countless videos on YouTube
regarding the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s start with defining what is a good webcam.</p>
<p>A good webcam, in my opinion, is a device that provides a decent sound quality,
at least on par with recent MacBooks, and an image quality on par with top
smartphones, such as iPhone 11/12, Huawei P40 Pro, etc. As smartphones have a
good image quality, then we could probably manufacture a webcam from smartphone
parts that are cheap and easily available. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>If you’ve read at least a couple of articles on the topic of video production,
you will know that to make quality content from the technical standpoint you
need three things, in that particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Video quality</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's discuss these properties and later how to manufacture it.</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound<a href="#sound" aria-label="Anchor link for: sound">🔗</a></h3>
<p>If you have a recent MacBook, it provides a decent sound quality with its
three-mic array. I haven't researched it and don’t know much about other
notebooks' audio quality. If you have a desktop PC, you have to have some
external mic anyway.</p>
<p>If the web camera has shitty audio quality, you’ll have to buy additional
gear. When I researched the topic, one of the recently released webcams
(available from October 2020) with RRP of $180 was producing a sound as if a
person sits in a big plastic barrel with a closed lid. Their voice was very
muffled with lots of resonant rattles. That level of quality wasn’t acceptable
10 years ago, how this piece of gear could have been produced in 2020 escapes my
understanding.</p>
<p>There are many good enough USB mics for $50+, you also can buy a great XLR
microphone for $100, but then you’ll need an external sound card with phantom
power supply. A decent one can easily cost you $200.</p>
<p>With almost any of these options you’ll have to install and configure some
software that will provide sound level compression, noise suppression (because
your notebook fans are spinning like hell) and won’t produce clicks in the
process.</p>
<p>I would like my webcam to do this by itself, no rattling, minimized echo, etc.</p>
<h3 id="light">Light<a href="#light" aria-label="Anchor link for: light">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A lot of what makes a picture great comes from lighting the scene in a correct way.</p>
<p>The simplest thing is to sit in a room so the window is in front of you and the
Sun isn’t shining into a lens from behind your shoulder.</p>
<p>Webcam cannot provide decent lighting capabilities by itself, so I won’t spend
much time here. There is a <a href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo/RZ19-02320100-R3M1">webcam by
Razer</a>
with a built-in LED circle, but it’s necessarily small, always shines from a
webcam direction and is mostly a gimmick.</p>
<p>We can rely somewhat on the good sensor here. If it provides good dynamic range,
HDR capabilities and good low-light performance, then a patch of sunlight on the
wall won't turn everything else black, or a poorly lit room won't turn into a
gray noisy picture with a bleak silhouette.</p>
<h3 id="image-quality">Image quality<a href="#image-quality" aria-label="Anchor link for: image-quality">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to get a good lens and image sensor into a notebook lid, because
lids are very thin. They’re often something like 4 mm thick all together, and
there is no escaping physics. Of course, it's possible to put a webcam into a
thick part below the lid, but then it'll be useful for expressing anger at our
colleagues with wide-open nostrils and not much else.</p>
<p>Maybe some crazy engineer in the future will develop an array of small sensors
with an array of tiny lenses and somehow combine all that into a good image
quality, but we don't have this tech yet. Any smartphone with a good camera has
that camera with an ugly protruding lens as a thickest part of the phone.</p>
<p>So, if you want something better than a notebook's webcam, you can get some
Logitech webcam with an image quality going back to 2012. It’s still better than
a laptop, but nowhere close to current smartphones.</p>
<p>What if you want better still? The next option is to install an app on the phone
and use it as a webcam. This gives a very good image quality, but it’s very
inconvenient and in some applications doesn’t work at all. For some reason it
isn’t always presented in applications as an option when choosing a video
source.</p>
<p>I don’t want to constantly attach, detach, charge my phone and tune the position of
a small tripod. What’s the next option?</p>
<p>The next option is to just buy a mirrorless photo-camera with a big fat 4/3” or
even APS-C sensor. It will cost $500+ for a new one (you can buy used for
cheaper). You will also need some gear to hold the camera in place, as it won’t
just rest on the top of the screen like a regular webcam. You also need an
HDMI-to-USB video grabber, and you need to be sure that the camera you buy can
output full resolution live onto that HDMI. Also make sure that it's possible to
turn off all on-screen info like <code>1/100s F3.5 ISO 800</code>, which is useful when
you're shooting photos and videos through viewfinder, but not so much when
you're in a video meeting. This feature is called "Clean HDMI".</p>
<p>Of course, you will have a lot of control over the whole stuff — set a
diaphragm, get good bokeh, set ISO, set white balance, etc. Do you actually need
it? Well, some of you do, and a lot of you do not. I learned all that stuff when
I was 16, but now I’m pretty happy with how my phone chooses everything for me
and just does great photos.</p>
<p>All that sounds pretty involved, isn’t it? It is a lot of time to research what
you need, how to set it all up, and a lot of money too.</p>
<h3 id="manufacturing-it">Manufacturing it<a href="#manufacturing-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: manufacturing-it">🔗</a></h3>
<p>So there is a market gap between so-so webcams for $100-200 and a full-blown
setup with a mirrorless camera, an external mic and lighting panels that will
cost almost a grand or two, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>I thought that it is a good idea to create an "upmarket" webcam for $250-300
that will provide good audio and video quality, on par with current smartphones,
actually using the same parts. As smartphones are made in tens of millions, all
relevant parts should be cheap and easily obtainable.</p>
<p>I quickly contacted some people who could help me do the project — firmware
engineer, electric engineer and a company that does mechanical design.</p>
<p>What features are needed for a good webcam for streamers and video meetings?
Audio: good parts (mics and ADC), good mechanical design and assembly (so
nothing would rattle), and some post-processing. We certainly want some
beam-forming capabilities to be able to focus on the person in front of the
webcam, so we will need more than one microphone, maybe up to 4. These parts are
easy to obtain, there are many in stock, it's not a problem.</p>
<p>Even if I think that 4k is not needed, I’m pretty sure it’s really a requirement
to have in an upmarket webcam, as it will be really hard to sell a pricey webcam
that can only do 1080p.</p>
<p>Also would be very nice to have some neural network inference on the chip, so we
can run some AI stuff directly on the webcam without bothering a user’s computer
that can be busy with other things.</p>
<p>I easily found a three-piece assembly for the iPhone 11 Pro for fifty bucks,
two-piece from a Huawei P40 Pro for twenty five and a one-piece from P40 Lite for
ten dollars. That’s with a lens, and bought in retail. Does it mean it costs
peanuts (less than $5 for a sensor) to buy in bulk to produce my own webcam?
Well... Maybe. I can’t just go and buy a couple thousands of these sensors. I’m
pretty sure I can buy a couple thousands of replacement parts for phones, but
sensors themselves are not sold freely. It's easy to buy some "random" sensor
that was around for years and most certainly has "meh" quality by today's
standards, but we need a good one, with good dynamic range, HDR capabilities and
low-light performance.</p>
<p>I wrote to several vendors asking them what are the prices and conditions, and
basically their answer is either silence or “we’ll sell it if you will buy
hundreds of thousands per year”.</p>
<p>I've found suitable System-on-Chips, and it's the same — if we want to have
hardware 4k encoder, it's either "sorry, it was a demo part and we don't do it",
or "we have limited support capabilities, so we can only sell if you will buy
hundreds of thousands, maybe you want some SoMs from our partners?". It is
actually possible to buy System-on-Modules even in very small quantities, but
it's going to be pretty expensive and will be good for a prototype, but for
production it will blow past our budget. System-on-Module will cost almost the
same as the web camera itself.</p>
<p>Oh, and a lead time (from order to shipment) is systematically 16+ weeks. It
means they have no stock and will place an order at semiconductor foundry, have
it produced, packaged and sent to customer. Swiftly.</p>
<p>It means I cannot just build five hundred webcams, see how good are they selling
and build a couple thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>There is also a plastic injection step that requires upfront investment to
manufacture molds, and of course design and engineering costs. All combined it
was tens of thousands …</p></section></div>

<p>Yesterday’s <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/21/a-to-do-app-that-fits-in-a-single-tweet/">post</a> was an awesome one, I learned a lot in JavaScript and and I was happy to see people doing what I thought impossible. Writing a simple todo app within 280 chars, in plain js.</p>
<p>After I finished writing the post, I wanted to share it on Reddit JavaScript community, r/javascript at the same time I shared it on HackerNews.</p>
<p>I have seen lot of comments on HackerNews criticizing the new Reddit design, using JavaScript and breaking in their mobile website, and constant nags pushing the users to their mobile app.</p>
<p>I was one of those few who liked their new design on desktop, no page loads between posting something, lot of white spaces, I feel most of the average users would be feeling the same, except for the tech community. But as a service Reddit should be looking at the common denominator, not the outliers.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed with the mobile app nag, when I visit the mobile website, Reddit is always asking me to download the mobile app. But I just cancel it and move along in the mobile browser.</p>
<p>But what happened yesterday just took me off the ledge. When I visited the r/javascript community on my iPad, I was greeted with this screen.</p>

<p>Why do you block me from from visiting the community from my mobile device?</p>
<p>Will the whole mobile website is scrapped and you end up with a landing page to download the mobile app?</p>
<p><strong>If you want to visit a popular subreddit</strong>, <strong>install our up and use it, or else login. </strong></p>
<p>I’ve managed to see the subreddit by requesting the desktop website, but I’m sure they will figure out a way, by checking the screen size to block this as well.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a company, you need to push to gain as much users as possible on their mobile devices, that’s the best way to track, to send notifications and keep you hooked and keep coming back. If I had a company like Reddit I might have done the same.</p>
<p>But for blocking users from their mobile devices, a service they once offered is a very dark pattern, instead what they should do is introduce some awesome features that will make the users download the app by themselves so they can enjoy those features. Not forcing the app though their throats.</p>
<p>Anyone else experienced a similar experience on Reddit mobile?</p>
<p><em>Only after writing the and checking the screenshot again made me see that they allow you to see the subreddit by logging in. But that is obscured and they intend to push users to download the app.</em></p>

You can skip to the  <a href="#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Horcruxing section</a>  if it seems redundant.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=compress" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>
