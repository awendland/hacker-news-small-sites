<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This week I found myself at yet another dinner party that mysteriously contained only two people who were not involved with the tech industry in some way.</p><p>As I looked around and realized for the hundredth time that I was surrounded by people exactly like me, something inside me snapped. I downloaded the latest <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/public_use_microdata_sample/" target="_blank">American Community Survey microdata</a>, fired up R and started calculating feverishly.</p><p>It turns out that among people who</p><ul><li>are under 35</li><li>live in San Francisco, Berkeley or Oakland</li><li>and have at least a bachelor’s degree</li></ul><p>about 10% have a computer-related occupation. An additional 5% are employed in some other capacity by a strongly computer-related industry.</p><p>That’s not <em>nearly</em> large enough to explain how saturated with coders my social groups are. I have plenty of social circles that are (at least nominally) totally different from my work: contra dancers, people interested in effective altruism, folk musicians, friends from college, and so on. And yet I keep finding myself in the middle of a programmer monoculture. Why?</p><p>As <a href="http://xkcd.com/1480/" target="_blank">Randall Munroe recently suggested</a>, suggests, maybe taking up a sport would help expose me to a broader range of people. But which one? Obviously not football, since I’m barely 150 pounds and don’t like traumatic brain injuries. Preferably a more elegant sport that doesn’t require a bunch of awkward equipment. Maybe Ultimate or rock climbing–</p><p>Wait, crap.</p><p>Part of the problem is that my taste in hobbies is influenced by class lines and subculture in ways that I hadn’t realized before.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It turns out that even when it’s totally up to me, most of the things I’m interested in are strongly associated with a very particular band of socioeconomic status—a much smaller band than the set of “all bachelor’s degree holders” in my ACS analysis.</p><p>This stronger selection sneaks in when I try to pick a sport based on things like “elegance,” instead of “size of community” or “what I’ve been playing since I was five years old” or whatever other things people might pick sports for. In fact, just the fact that I’m interested in doing sports for leisure is associated with class, since it’s not something that would be so easy for, say, manual laborers or shift workers.</p><p>But I don’t think socioeconomic selection explains all of it. My parents’ friends were similarly selected, but they didn’t all have <em>literally the same job</em>, and the ones that did were usually coworkers—not people they had met socially who bizarrely all happened to work on the same stuff. My friends in other occupations with similar base rates—say, school teachers—don’t wonder where all the non-teachers are at social events. And I don’t even feel like I’m from a similar subculture to many programmers. What else could be going on?</p><ul><li><p>Maybe that crackpot-sounding stuff about the “programmer’s brain” actually has something to it. Maybe programmers are all drawn to the same activities because those activities are friendly to the programmer’s innately logical, systematizing and abstract habits of thought.</p></li><li><p>Programmers could talk about programming too much, or smell bad, or something, so people from other professions are less likely to put up with them at social events.</p></li><li><p>Perhaps the various subcultures of programmers are closer together, and more distinct from other subcultures, than I perceive. Maybe “programmer culture” is less analogous to other single professions and more analogous to “academic culture” or “hippie culture,” where it would be more reasonable to have that be your entire social group.</p></li><li><p>Maybe I miscalculated from the ACS data and there are actually way more programmers than the 10% number suggests.</p></li></ul><p>Unless I’ve miscalculated pretty badly, though, it’s clear that these social bubble effects are way stronger and more tenacious than I would have expected. And this is just one of the axes where it’s <em>obvious</em> that all the variance is being selected out. I wonder what more subtle facts are being selected for this strongly in my social groups?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>When I lived in Boston, the people I associated with were determined mostly by my parents or my private high school/college, which is plenty enough to explain a monoculture without getting into class effects. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></article></div>]]>

            IT IS FINALLY (mostly) COMPLETED. If anyone has ever heard directly from God Himself, the conception of this keyboard was definitely the message. 450 keys of solid non-mx-browness and
            433% the size of a normal full size, what more could you ask for? This keyboard fits 2 (two) full football fields on it {diagram on page 9 of your textbooks}. and um yeah thats kinda it idk can you see it there isnt much to say.

  <div dir="auto">
    <p>I don’t like how modern web applications are built. Many of the web applications
are too unstable, That you can’t imagine having the system running without a
team supporting it. The fact that we try to automate manual processes then the
automation needs manual intervention defies the purpose. Some companies has an
army of developers if they were to do the business by hand they would make a
better job than the programmed system. There are many reasons for this
situation. One of the reasons is the excessive use of third party dependencies.</p>

<p>Lets take a look on a basic modern web based system, There are several layers
on software running on the machine, starting from firmware to your business
logic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_212438.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_212438.jpg"></p>

<p>I don’t think this is very helpful to understand the gravity of the situation.
There are many actors that are not considered in this picture. Layers are also
missing because they are implicit in other layers. Lets expand these hidden
layers and actors. It will help us understand better why that small Nodejs or
RubyOnRails application we wrote isn’t just one layer in this picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_214548.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_214548.jpg"></p>

<p>Here are the layers we added this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System core utilities</li>
  <li>Other processes your application depends on like “memcached, Redis, MySQL,
Postgres…etc”</li>
  <li>Third party code your application depends on an ORM, Template engine,
pagination library, a library that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">pads your string with
spaces</a> just
because.</li>
  <li>Server applications that sits in front of your code handling HTTP and response
compression…etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these layers there is <strong>at least</strong> one team responsible for
maintaining it.</p>

<p>Again, We missed other layers and people in this picture. Most of the
applications are using external SAAS providers for logs or monitoring or bug
reporting or provide parts of the system functionality that can take more time
to build by the company team. lets add them to the picture along with their
teams.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_221047.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_221047.jpg"></p>

<p>This picture is for one application, I won’t expand it to a whole system with
different services and programs that is the reality of all companies.
Lets stick to one application for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>So here is the first point I want to make: With every service you use you’re not
just a user, This service is now part of your application, You are held
responsible for it’s behavior and misbehaving. You will inherit bugs in their
system. When this service team is affected by COVID-19 and get reduced to the
point where they can’t fix issues you will be affected too. When They get slower
your application will get slower too. When their service is down your
application will experience malfunction too, Your system and theirs is now
connected. So add external services integration cautiously. By adding an
external system you’re putting your trust in this service team and their ability
in delivering what the service is promising now <strong>and</strong> in the future. This is not
an easy decision and it should be treated as such.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_224907.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_224907.jpg"></p>

<p>Now lets move to the direct dependencies of your application. If you’re using
any modern programming language it’ll have a way to package code into reusable
format that could be reused by other applications. one package can use code from
other packages, these packages can use other packages and so on like a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_231326.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_231326.jpg"></p>

<p>With every package in this tree we depend on the code inside this package and
the team that maintains it. A freshly generated rails project depends on 74
packages for ruby and <code>Yarn list</code> that lists JavaScript dependencies output 3102
lines, that’s 3176 packages with teams maintaining them and bugs and new
versions all the time.</p>

<p>This is wrong for many reasons. I will list some of them here for the sake of
clarity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have put your trust in at least 3176 other developers. You have never met
them, never talked to them, there are no guarantee they will continue to
maintain this package. There are no guarantee they won’t put code in their
package to show <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/npm-bans-terminal-ads/">ads in your
terminal</a> or <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets">code that
steals your bitcoin wallets
</a>.</li>
  <li>You are not really using all of this code. When someone is writing an open
source package it will suffer sooner or later from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature
creeping</a> You are probably using
couple features of this package and don’t need the rest, but you wanted the
banana and got the whole forest now.</li>
  <li>With every package update you’re inventing unnecessary work for yourself. New
versions of packages are released all the time. Updating your project to <strong>get
the latest bug fixes and features</strong> is usually what people do. Most of the
time because of feature creeping these versions changes are not relevant to
you at all, but you won’t know until you read the change log. If it’s relevant
to your project you’ll need to do an update. if something is deprecated or
changed you’ll need to change your code. So suddenly someone somewhere is
telling you to change your code. That’s part of the control you have over your
code handed over to someone you never talked to or knew.</li>
  <li>When your programming language has a new release you can’t update unless all of
your dependencies are up to date. For ruby 2.7.0 for example some language syntax is
now deprecated and shows warning when you run your project. So to fix that you
either fix it in the package and open a PR with the change or wait for the
maintainer to update it.</li>
  <li>When you encounter a bug in a dependency you will have to understand this
package code, fork, branch, fix rinse and repeat. That requires a some
cooperation from the library maintainer which is most of the time isn’t
possible because most of the open source projects are voluntarily maintained.</li>
  <li>Developing new features or modifying existing features are ordre of magnitude
harder. You’ll need to dig into the documentation of the dependencies looking
for support for this little feature you want to add. That is if there is any
documentation at all for that part of the code. Otherwise you’ll have to dig
in to the library code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second point I want to make: Using external library implies that you
trust the maintainer and you also inherit his decisions about using other
libraries and so forth. This decision should be weighed based on the benefit of
the library and how many of it’s features you’re going to use and other factors
like the maturity and how responsive is the maintainer, please don’t use GitHub
stars as a factor in your decision it’s misleading. And if the part you use from
the library isn’t too big I recommend using the library to save some time and
effort upfront but make sure you get rid of it and implement the part you need.
An example of that is a pagination library like rails “Kaminari” if you’re using
it to save you some time then sure. But keep on your todo list a task to remove
it and implement the feature yourself. An example of libraries that’s hard to
get rid of it “OpenCV” This is something that reimplementing the part you need
probably will be a huge task so it can stay. You’ll need to use your best
judgment to decide between these 2 sides of the spectrum.</p>

<p>I like to think of what I do as building an automated system, I would like this
system to run by itself, keep itself clean and healthy, doesn’t need manual
intervention. If the whole team disappeared out of existence I would like that
system to work for a very long time without any supervision.</p>

<p>More code means more bugs for me to fix, by extension more code that I didn’t write
means more bugs that I probably can’t solve. This is dangerous and shouldn’t be
taken lightly. Extending your code with external libraries or systems can cut
down effort hence the cost of development. But when this is taken lightly it
backfires badly.</p>

<p>Consider this incomplete snippet of Rust code:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>fn</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I want to see an LR parser which produces the following syntax tree
(from <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#show-syntax-tree"><strong>Show Syntax Tree</strong></a> rust-analyzer command, with whitespace nodes elided for clarity):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

</div>
<p>The most error-resilient LR-style parser I know, <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree sitter</a>, produces this instead (tree sitter is GLR, this is <strong>not</strong> the style of parsing advocated by the article):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

    identifier [0, 3] - [0, 6])
    struct_pattern [2, 0] - [4, 1])
      type: type_identifier [2, 0] - [2, 6])
      ERROR [2, 7] - [2, 8])
        identifier [2, 7] - [2, 8])
      field_pattern [3, 3] - [3, 9])
        name: field_identifier [3, 3] - [3, 4])
        pattern: identifier [3, 6] - [3, 9])
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note two things about the rust-analyzer’s tree:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There’s an (incomplete) “function” node for <code>fn foo(</code>.
Unclosed parenthesis doesn’t preclude the parser from recognizing parameter list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incomplete function does not prevent struct definition from being recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are important for IDE support.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the cursor is just after <code>(</code>.
If we have rust-analyzer’s syntax tree, than we can figure out that we are completing a function parameter.
If we are to get fancy we might find the calls to the (not yet fully written) <code>foo</code>, run type inference to figure out the type of the first argument, and than suggest parameter name &amp; type based on that (not currently implemented — there’s soooooo much yet to be done in rust-analyzer).
And correctly recognizing <code>struct S</code> is important to not break type-inference in the code which uses <code>S</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of literature about error recovery for LR parsers, how come academics haven’t figured this out already?
I have a bold claim to make: error-recovery research in academia is focusing on a problem irrelevant for IDEs.
Specifically, the research is focused on finding “minimal cost repair sequence”:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a set of edit operations is defined (skip, change or insert token),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a “cost” metric is defined to distinguish big and small edits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an algorithm is devised to find the smallest edit which makes the current text parse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is a very academia-friendly problem — there’s a precise mathematical formulation, there’s an obvious brute force solution (try all edits), and there’s ample space for finding polynomial algorithm.</p>
<p>But IDEs don’t care about actually guessing &amp; repairing the text!
They just need to see as much of (possibly incomplete) syntax nodes in the existing text as possible.
When rust-analyzer’s parser produces</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>  PARAM_LIST@6..7
    L_PAREN@6..7 "("
STRUCT@9..31
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>it doesn’t think “Oh, I need to insert <code>)</code> here to complete the list of parameters”.
Rather, it sees <code>struct</code> and thinks “Oh wow, didn’t expect that! I guess I’ll just stop parsing parameter list right here”.</p>
<p>So, here’s</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>First Challenge</p>
Design error <em>resilient</em> (and not just error <em>recovering</em>) LR parsing algorithm.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note that error resilience is a topic orthogonal to error reporting.
I haven’t payed much attention to error reporting (in my experience, synchronous reporting of syntax errors in the editor compensates for bad syntax error messages), but it might be the case that MCRS are a good approach to there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>By Pau Alcalá - Co-founder of Palabra</em></p><p>While finding product-market fit for <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>, our marketing strategy was exclusively organic and our first sales came from 1-1 conversations with potential users. After a month of difficult conversations and failed demos, I learned a very new and innovative approach to direct sales: actually listening to what people are saying. In this post I'll share my experience and some tips to listen to users, in the hopes of saving founders &amp; early startup teams some time and energy.</p><h2>What we mean by direct sales</h2><p>As the name suggest, direct sales means you talk directly to your prospect and try to sell them your solution via a 1-1 conversation. This conversation usually starts by reaching the prospect you think your product would work for, and sharing why you think your solution would be good for them.</p><p>Taking a direct approach is more common for B2B businesses, because the decision to purchase is strategical and the price is higher, which means you get a bigger return for each user you convert. But I think it's a good strategy to follow for any early stage SaaS, because it's an easy and direct way of learning about your users and implementing solutions that work for them.</p><p>The biggest challenges to direct sales is finding the right prospects and knowing how to show them value as quickly as possible. With direct conversations you'll probably get a higher conversion rate than self-served sales, but at a much slower rate.</p><h2>Why direct sales in a SaaS startup?</h2><p>When we launched <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a> we had no audience and not enough user data to understand who we should be targeting or how to convert them into paying users. We had two possible paths to follow:</p><ol><li>Awareness-first: Experimenting with low-budget ads or organic strategies in different channels, with different messages to see which stick better. This approach is the startup playbook, feeding the top of the funnel with as many prospects as possible assuming most of them will not end up buying, and learn how to convert them better later on.</li><li>Conversion-first: Spending almost no time to feed the top of the funnel (keep a low stream of leads and prospects) but improving that funnel to have better conversions. Leads would be scarce, but we'd learn how to qualify them and provide value so they are willing to buy and stay around.</li></ol><p>The first path was the riskier for us. First, because we had little experience with paid acquisition, and wouldn't know if our misses would be due to lack of experience or just wrong channels.</p><p>Second, we wanted to engage in deep conversations with users as soon as possible. We didn't really care about general trends, we wanted to actually understand what people were struggling with in email automation, and where to take our product so that it worked for them. That's why we decided to take the second path.</p><p>Our initial strategy was to ask a bunch of questions about people's current email automation strategies and try to turn the initial conversation into a sales pitch. We'd learn fast and get a few sales in the meantime.</p><p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it was not.</p><h2>What a failed sales conversation looks like</h2><p>After my first couple of calls I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what it was. Sign ups were rarely because of my "sales" 1-1s, and every conversation left me with a sour feeling.</p><p>What usually happened was that I got to a call, asked the person a couple of questions about their strategies, and at some point I'd get nervous and start talking a lot. People are usually nice and would listen to what I had to say, but I could feel they weren't really interested, and felt like I was wasting time.</p><p>So what was I doing wrong?</p><p>After talking with my co-founder and a couple of friends in the SaaS industry, I found that I wasn't really paying attention to what prospects were saying. My team would ask questions about our prospects that I didn't know how to answer.</p><p>That meant I wasn't really selling, but I also wasn't learning about our users. I found I had to learn how to listen first, and sell later.</p><h2>How to talk less and sell more</h2><p>Listening to prospects is not at easy as it sounds when you are worried about selling them your solution. Specially if you're in early stage and don't have much experience selling software, it'll be hard to keep a clear mind and letting the user take the conversation where they want to.</p><p>But here's the thing: selling isn't about convincing people to try your product, it's about identifying how your product can solve a problem for them.</p><p>In a direct sales conversation, you should have two take outs:</p><ol><li>Identifying if the person you're talking to has a problem you could solve (the more details the better)</li><li>Communicating clearly how your product is a solution to their problem.</li></ol><p>If you fail at #1, you'll end up trying to convince people who don't actually have a problem you could help them with. Those are not your users, and there's nothing you can do today to make their life easier. Even if you somehow convince them to sign up, they'll probably cancel their subscription, making your churn go up.</p><p>Failing at #2 is usually connected to #1, because the only way of communicating a solution clearly is to understand the problem perfectly. You have to <strong>listen really carefully</strong> to understand what those problems are.</p><p>Most of your conversations with prospects should be about #1. Make a lot of questions. Listen closely and follow up on what isn't clear. Make the other person feel listened to. Worst case scenario, you end up with valuable insights about what problems people have. As an early stage startup, this information is crucial to find product-market fit.</p><p>Here are some lessons I learned while taking a direct sales approach to SaaS. Most of them came from reading <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>, talking to awesome people and experimenting on my own.</p><h2>3 direct sales tips to listen to your users</h2><h3>Writing down what you want to get from the conversation</h3><p>This list should be really short. My initial conversation guide had 15+ questions to get to understand the problem, and then a short demo. It worked kinda fine, but I usually got lost by question 5, and then started thinking about what to ask next instead of listening to the answer.</p><p>The Mom Test suggests you should "prepare your list of 3". Three things you want to get from each conversation, depending on who you'll be talking to. And that was magic.</p><p>In early Palabra demos, when I asked to have a quick chat to someone in a startup, I usually had three different scenarios:</p><ul><li>The founder talked to me directly, who had no details about the email automation strategies his/her team was using but could provide context.</li><li>I talked to a marketer in the startup, who usually had many years of experience and had tried a bunch of other email automation tools.</li><li>I talked to a technical co-founder or dev, who had a lot of questions about technical aspects of Palabra and had tried different integrations before.</li></ul><p>I prepared three different notes to look at before each conversation, one for each "buyer" persona, and wrote down my list of three.</p><p>I started asking questions that came to mind from listening to what people were saying, and spend almost no time looking at my notes. If I ever felt I was starting to get lost, I just glanced to my list of three for that particular person to check if I was missing something. Freedom.</p><h3>Having a structured set of questions</h3><p>This advice came from a great friend and the <a href="http://sofandrade.com/">best UX designer I've met</a>. She knows all about user interviews, and since I was also trying to learn from our prospects, I knew it would help. Her advice was to divide my questions into chunks or topics I wanted to know about.</p><p>Having differentiated topics gives you flexibility to follow the conversation and not worry about what to ask after each answer. If you ask a question from the first topic and your user's answer goes to a slightly different topic, you can go to that part of your guide and then come back after that's done.</p><p>As an example, this was the structure I ended up using for each guide:</p><ul><li>About them/their job/their goals</li><li>About their emails, what they were using them from</li><li>About their email automation tools, what they were using and how</li><li>About their pains, what was missing from their current tools?</li></ul><p>What usually happened is that my email questions got answers related to tools. So I just moved over to the "tools" set of questions and then looked to see if I was missing something important at the end.</p><p>A smart move was to leave questions about pains for last. By then I usually had enough information about their problem and could offer a clear solution with <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>.</p><p>If we had a solution, I'd briefly tell people why I thought this would work, and offered to show them in a demo. By focusing on their specific solution in the demo, I only showed one feature and not the whole product, which was a much better use of everyone's time.</p><h3>Doing some background research - but still ask people</h3><p>You can't go into a sales pitch without knowing who you're talking to. For B2B sales you need to know about the company and the person you're actually going to talk to. The key here is to use that information wisely.</p><p>I used to start conversations on what I'd learned from their landing page, to let people know I had done my homework. But his was actually making me start with the wrong foot -by talking too much.</p><p>Asking about their company and what they do there gives you inside information you wouldn't get from LinkedIn or a landing page. And it also helps break the ice, since it's an easy answer for anyone.</p><p>My solution was full transparency. I started each conversation by saying I had done a bit of research about them but still wanted to hear from themselves. Then I would ask what they usually do.</p><p>This was incredibly effective. Being honest took away all of my nervousness and allowed me to relax into the conversation. I felt like I had no secrets, I was just telling the truth and asking questions. And I think this works both ways: the person you're talking to will probably trust you more if you're …</p></section></div>

        <p>Today Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2020/">at their media event</a> that the final public release of iOS 14 ships tomorrow, which came as quite a shock to all third-party developers.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>This unwelcome surprise comes against the backdrop of dozens of controversies around the App Store — most recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">Hey.com</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-account">Epic</a>, but more generally its <a href="https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes">painfully confusing</a> and <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors">arbitrarily applied</a> rules, its incomprehensible <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/rejection/">app rejections</a> and their often sudden retractions, app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/07/flexbright-adjust-display-temperature/">approvals followed by sudden removals</a> without explanation, and the general unequal treatment of developers where <a href="https://gizmodo.com/researchers-uber-s-ios-app-had-secret-permissions-that-1819177235">big companies</a> or favorites <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/27/bbedit-12-6-to-return-to-the-mac-app-store/">get special treatment</a>. It leaves me wondering, what the hell is Apple’s strategy here? This is not a flurry of bad PR for the sake of it. There are serious problems here that need to be addressed — in particular, Developer Relations.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Historically, these events announce new hardware and the upcoming release of the next major version of iOS, which is typically made public a few days later or the following week. For as long as I can remember it goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple hosts a media event on a Tuesday in September.</li>
  <li>Announcements include new iPhones, iPads, and Watches. Or, at least some combination of those. Maybe something about Apple TV.</li>
  <li>All of the new hardware will run the latest version of iOS (or watchOS, or tvOS).</li>
  <li>The next major release of iOS is announced to be shipping on Friday (in a few days) or sometime the following week, like the next Tuesday.</li>
</ul>

<p>But today, Apple announced that iOS 14 is shipping <strong>tomorrow</strong>. This was near the end of the event — at roughly 11:00 AM Pacific time. This means West Coast developers have half a day to put the final touches on their app updates for iOS 14 <strong>AND</strong> get their apps submitted with the just-released Xcode 12 GM <strong>AND</strong> get through App Store review. None of those tasks are trivial, and no one familiar with them would agree that this is a sufficient amount of time to complete them. If you happen to be working on the East Coast, this means you were given just a few hours before the working day was over to get your app ready and submitted. And if you live in Europe or anywhere else in the world, well, go fuck yourself and good luck tomorrow!</p>

<p>On top of this, critical bugs still exist in the latest releases of the SDKs, Xcode 12, and iOS 14. It seems they will not be addressed.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Given the increasingly tenuous relationship that Apple has with developers, I do not understand how it could be in their interest to act like such an asshole right now. Not to mention, it is unlikely that they will even be able to review all of these app submissions in time. We already do not feel valued due to the aforementioned issues, and this is an outright negligent response to developer relationships the company has damaged over the past few years. Announcing that iOS 14 ships tomorrow with virtually no notice to developers is yet another breach of trust, another disappointment, and quite frankly feels like a big ‘fuck you’ to developers. What purpose does it serve to place this last-minute, unnecessary stress on third-party developers?</p>

<p>Who is in charge of iOS releases at Apple that thought this was a good idea? Who is the head of Developer Relations that thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>To whomever made these decisions: <strong>y’all fucked up. Again.</strong></p>

<![CDATA[Bazel For Open-Source C/C++ Libraries Distribution]]>

September 15, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past a few days, I’ve been experimenting with Bazel as a library distribution mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>.</p>

<p>I am pretty familiar with hermetic build systems at this point. My main knowledge comes from Buck dating 8 years back. At that time, it never occurred to me such a build system could eventually be a library distribution mechanism. During the same 8 years, NPM has taken over the world. New language-dependent package managers such as Go module, Cargo and Swift Package Manager popularized the concept of using the public repositories (GitHub) as the dependency references. Languages prior to this period, mainly C / C++ are moving to this direction, slowly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> has a simple autoconf based feature detection / configuration system. You would expect the package to work when <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>. However, it never made any serious attempt to be too smart. My initial experience with monorepos at companies strongly influenced the decision to have a simple build system. I fully expect that serious consumers will vendor the library into their monorepo using their own build systems.</p>

<p>This has been true for the past a few years. But as I am finishing up <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> and increasingly using that for other closed-source personal projects, maintaining a closed-source <em>monorepo</em> setup for my personal projects while upstreaming fixes is quite an unpleasant experience. On the other hand, <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> from the beginning meant to be a low-level implementation. I am expected to have high-level language bindings at some point. Given that I am doing more application-related development with <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> in closed-source format now, it feels like the right time.</p>

<p>Although there is no one-true library distribution mechanism for C / C++, there are contenders. From the good-old apt / rpm, to Conan, which has gained some mind-share in the open-source world in recent years.</p>

<p>The choice of Bazel is not accidental. I’ve been doing <a href="https://liuliu.me/eyes/migrating-ios-project-to-bazel-a-real-world-experience/">some Swift development with Bazel</a> and the experience has been positive. Moreover, the choice of high-level binding language for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a>, I figured, would be Swift.</p>

<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>’s build process, as much as I would rather not, is host-dependent. I use autoconf to detect system-wide libraries such as libjpeg and libpng, to configure proper compiler options. Although <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> can be used with zero dependency, in that configuration, it can sometimes be slow.</p>

<p>Coming from the monorepo background, Bazel doesn’t have many utilities that are as readily available as in autoconf. You can write automatic configurations in Starlark as <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/repository_rules.html">repository rules</a>, but there is no good documentation on how to write robust ones.</p>

<p>I ended up <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/WORKSPACE#L25">letting whoever use ccv to decide how they are going to enable certain features</a>. For things like CUDA, such configuration is not tenable. I ended up copying over <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/rules_cuda">TensorFlow’s CUDA rules</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>Good old C / C++ libraries are notoriously indifferent to libraries dependencies v.s. toolchains. Autoconf detects both toolchain configurations as well as available libraries. These types of host dependencies make cross-compilation a skill in itself.</p>

<p>Bazel is excellent for in-tree dependencies. For out-tree dependencies however, there is no established mechanism. The popular way is to write a <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/protobuf_deps.bzl#L5">repository rules to load relevant dependencies</a>.</p>

<p>This actually works well for me. It is versatile enough to handle cases that <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/config/ccv.bzl#L103">have Bazel integrations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/deps.bzl#L17">have no Bazel integrations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consume-bazel-dependencies">Consume Bazel Dependencies</h2>

<p>Consumption of the packaged Bazel dependencies then becomes as simple as adding <code>git_repository</code> to the <code>WORKSPACE</code> and call proper <code>&lt;your_library_name&gt;_deps()</code> repository rule.</p>

<p>After packaging <a href="https://libccv.org/">ccv</a> with Bazel, now <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/WORKSPACE#L3">Swift for nnc can consume the packaged dependency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning-challenges">Semantic Versioning Challenges</h2>

<p>While the Bazel-provided library distribution mechanism works well for my case, it is simplistic. For one, there is really no good way to do <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. It is understandable. Coming from a monorepo culture, it is challenging for anyone to dive into dependency hells of library versioning. A <a href="https://donatstudios.com/Go-v2-Modules">slightly different story happened to Go</a> a while back as well.</p>

<p>It is messy if you want to pin a specific version of the library while your dependencies are not agreeing with you. This is going to be messy regardless in C / C++ world, unless you prelink these extremely carefully. Bazel’s philosophy from what I can see, seems largely on <em>keeping the trunk working</em> side. It is working so far, but one has to wonder whether this can scale if more libraries adopted Bazel as the distribution mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>

<p>The past a few months experience with Bazel has been delightful. While I would continue to use language specific tools (pip, Go modules, Cargo, NPM) when doing development in that particular language, Bazel is a capable choice for me when doing cross-language development. Concepts such as <code>workspace</code>, <code>git_repository</code>, <code>http_archive</code> fit well within the larger open-source ecosystem. And most surprisingly, it works for many-repo setup if you ever need to.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

					<p>A friend once said to me: <q>You know, to some people, C is just a bunch of macros that expand to assembly</q>. It’s been years ago (smartasses: it was also before <tt>llvm</tt>, ok?), but the sentence stuck with me. Do <em>Kernighan and Ritchie</em> really look at a C program and see assembly code? Does <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> surf the Web any differently than you and me? And what on earth <em>did</em> <em>Keanu Reeves</em> see when he looked at all of that funky green gibberish soup, anyway? No, seriously, what the heck <em>did</em> he see there?! Uhm, back to the program. Anyway, what does Python look like in <em>Guido van Rossum</em>‘s<sup>1</sup> eyes?</p>
<p>This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/tag/pythons-innards/">series</a> on Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I read Python code. On the curriculum is mainly <em>CPython</em>, mainly <em>py3k</em>, mainly <em>bytecode evaluation</em> (I’m not a big compilation fan) – but practically everything around executing Python and Python-like code (<em>Unladen Swallow</em>, <em>Jython</em>, <em>Cython</em>, etc) might turn out to be fair game in this series. For the sake of brevity and my sanity, when I say <em>Python</em>, I mean <em>CPython</em> unless noted otherwise. I also assume a POSIX-like OS or (if and where it matters) Linux, unless otherwise noted. You should read this if you want to know how Python works. You should read this if you want to contribute to CPython. You should read this to find all the mistakes I’ll make and snicker at me behind me back or write snide comments. I realize it’s just <em>your</em> particular way to show affection.</p>
<p>I gather I’ll glean pretty much everything I write about from Python’s source or, occasionally, other fine materials (documentation, especially <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/c-api/index.html">this</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/extending/index.html">that</a>, certain PyCon lectures, <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/05/07/searching-mailing-list-archives-offline/">searching</a> <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev">python-dev</a>, etc). Everything is out there, but I do hope my efforts at putting it all in one place to which you can RSS-subscribe will make your journey easier. I assume the reader knows some C, some OS theory, a bit less than some assembly (any architecture), a bit more than some Python and has reasonable UNIX fitness (i.e., feels comfortable installing something from source). Don’t be afraid if you’re not reasonably conversant in one (or more) of these, but I can’t promise smooth sailing, either. Also, if you don’t have a working toolchain to do Python development, maybe you’d like to head over <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/08/contributing-to-python/">here</a> and do as it says on the second paragraph (and onwards, as relevant).</p>
<p>Let’s start with something which I assume you already know, but I think is important, at least to the main way I understand… well, everything that I do understand. I look at it as if I’m looking at a machine. It’s easy in Python’s case, since Python relies on a Virtual Machine to do what it does (like many other interpreted languages). Be certain you understand “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">Virtual Machine</a>” correctly in this context: think more like JVM and less like VirtualBox (very technically, they’re the same, but in the real world we usually differentiate these two kinds of VMs). I find it easiest to understand “Virtual Machine” literally – it’s a machine built from software. Your CPU is just a complex electronic machine which receives all input (machine code, data), it has a state (registers), and based on the input and its state it will output stuff (to RAM or a Bus), right? Well, CPython is a machine built from software components that has a state and processes instructions (different implementations may use rather different instructions). This software machine operates in the process hosting the Python interpreter. Keep this in mind; I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">machine</a> metaphor (as I explain in minute details <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/07/04/pythons-innards-for-my-wife/">here</a>).</p>
<p>That said, let’s start with a bird’s eye overview of what happens when you do this: <kbd>$ python -c 'print("Hello, world!")'</kbd>. Python’s binary is executed, the standard C library initialization which pretty much any process does happens and then the main function starts executing (see its source, <kbd>./Modules/python.c: main</kbd>, which soon calls <kbd>./Modules/main.c: Py_Main</kbd>). After some mundane initialization stuff (parse arguments, see if environment variables should affect behaviour, assess the situation of the standard streams and act accordingly, etc), <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#Py_Initialize">./Python/pythonrun.c: Py_Initialize</a> is called. In many ways, this function is what ‘builds’ and assembles together the pieces needed to run the CPython machine and makes ‘a process’ into ‘a process with a Python interpreter in it’. Among other things, it creates two very important Python data-structures: the <strong>interpreter state</strong> and <strong>thread state</strong>. It also creates the built-in <strong>module</strong> <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html">sys</a> and the module which hosts all <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#built-in-functions">builtins</a>. At a later post(s) we will cover all these in depth.</p>
<p>With these in place, Python will do one of several things based on how it was executed. Roughly, it will either execute a string (the <kbd>-c</kbd> option), execute a module as an executable (the <kbd>-m</kbd> option), or execute a file (passed explicitly on the commandline or passed by the kernel when used as an interpreter for a script) or run its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a> loop (this is more a special case of the file to execute being an interactive device). In the case we’re currently following, it will execute a single string, since we invoked it with <kbd>-c</kbd>. To execute this single string, <kbd>./Python/pythonrun.c: PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> is called. This function creates the <kbd>__main__</kbd> <strong>namespace</strong>, which is ‘where’ our string will be executed (if you run <kbd>$ python -c 'a=1; print(a)'</kbd>, where is <kbd>a</kbd> stored? in this namespace). After the namespace is created, the string is executed in it (or rather, interpreted or <em>evaluated</em> in it). To do that, you must first transform the string into something that machine can work on.</p>
<p>As I said, I’d rather not focus on the innards of Python’s parser/compiler at this time. I’m not a compilation expert, I’m not entirely interested in it, and as far as I know, Python doesn’t have significant Compiler-Fu beyond the basic CS compilation course. We’ll do a (very) fast overview of what goes on here, and may return to it later only to inspect visible CPython behaviour (see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement">global</a> statement, which is said to affect parsing, for instance). So, the parser/compiler stage of <kbd>PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> goes largely like this: tokenize and create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_syntax_tree">Concrete Syntax Tree</a> (CST) from the code, transorm the CST into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) and finally compile the AST into a <strong>code object</strong> using <kbd>./Python/ast.c: PyAST_FromNode</kbd>. For now, think of the code object as a binary string of machine code that Python VM’s ‘machinary’ can operate on – so now we’re ready to do interpretation (again, <em>evaluation</em> in Python’s parlance).</p>
<p>We have an (almost) empty <kbd>__main__</kbd>, we have a code object, we want to evaluate it. Now what? Now this line: <kbd>Python/pythonrun.c: run_mod, v = PyEval_EvalCode(co, globals, locals);</kbd> does the trick. It receives a code object and a namespace for <strong>globals</strong> and for <strong>locals</strong> (in this case, both of them will be the newly created <kbd>__main__</kbd> namespace), creates a <strong>frame object</strong> from these and executes it. You remember previously that I mentioned that <kbd>Py_Initialize</kbd> creates a thread state, and that we’ll talk about it later? Well, back to that for a bit: each Python thread is represented by its own thread state, which (among other things) points to the stack of currently executing frames. After the frame object is created and placed at the top of the thread state stack, it (or rather, the byte code pointed by it) is evaluated, opcode by opcode, by means of the (rather lengthy) <kbd>./Python/ceval.c: PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd>.</p>
<p><kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> takes the frame, extracts opcode (and operands, if any, we’ll get to that) after opcode, and executes a short piece of C code matching the opcode. Let’s take a closer look at what these “opcodes” look like by disassembling a bit of compiled Python code:</p>
<pre title="">&gt;&gt;&gt; from dis import dis # ooh! a handy disassembly function!
&gt;&gt;&gt; co = compile("spam = eggs - 1", "&lt;string&gt;", "exec")
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis(co)
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (eggs)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              6 BINARY_SUBTRACT     
              7 STORE_NAME               1 (spam)
             10 LOAD_CONST               1 (None)
             13 RETURN_VALUE        
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
<p>…even without knowing much about Python’s bytecode, this is reasonably readable. You “load” the name <kbd>eggs</kbd> (where do you load it from? where do you load it to? soon), and also load a constant value (<kbd>1</kbd>), then you do a “binary subtract” (what do you mean ‘binary’ in this context? between which operands?), and so on and so forth. As you might have guessed, the names are “loaded” from the <kbd>globals</kbd> and <kbd>locals</kbd> namespaces we’ve seen earlier, and they’re loaded onto an operand stack (not to be confused with the stack of running frames), which is exactly where the binary subtract will pop them from, subtract one from the other, and put the result back on that stack. “Binary subtract” just means this is a subtraction opcode that has two operands (hence it is “binary”, this is not to say the operands are binary numbers made of ‘0’s and ‘1’s).</p>
<p>You can go look at <kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> at <kbd>./Python/ceval.c</kbd> yourself, it’s not a small function by any means. For practical reasons I can’t paste too much code from there in here, but I will just paste the code that runs when a <kbd>BINARY_SUBTRACT</kbd> opcode is found, I think it really illustrates things:</p>
<pre title="">        TARGET(BINARY_SUBTRACT)
            w = POP();
            v = TOP();
            x = PyNumber_Subtract(v, w);
            Py_DECREF(v);
            Py_DECREF(w);
            SET_TOP(x);
            if (x != NULL) DISPATCH();
            break;
</pre>
<p>…pop something, take the top (of the operand stack), call a C function called PyNumber_Subtract() on these things, do something we still don’t understand (but will in due time) called “Py_DECREF” on both, set the top of the stack to the result of the subtraction (overwriting the previous top) and then do something else we don’t understand if x is not null, which is to do a …</p></div></div>

September 15, 2020 | https://qvault.io/2020/09/15/gos-major-version-handling-sucks-from-a-fanboy/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://qvault.io/2020/09/15/gos-major-version-handling-sucks-from-a-fanboy/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I’m normally a fan of the rigidity within the Go toolchain. In fact, we use Go on the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">front and backend at Qvault</a>. It’s wonderful to have standardized formatting, vetting, and testing across the entire language. The first real criticism I’ve had is with the way Go modules handle major versions. It’s over-the-top opinionated and slows down development in a significant number of scenarios.</p>



<h2>Refresher on “Go Mod”</h2>



<p>Go modules, and the associated commands <code>go mod</code> and <code>go get</code> can be thought of as Go’s equivalents to NPM and Yarn. The Go toolchain provides a way to manage dependencies and lock the versions that a collection of code depends on.</p>



<p>One of the most common operations is to update a dependency in an existing module. For example:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash"># update all dependencies
go get -u ./...

# add missing and remove unused dependencies
go mod tidy

# save all dependency code in the project's "vendor" folder
go mod vendor</code></pre>



<h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>



<p>Go modules use git tags and semantic versioning to keep track of the versions of dependencies that are compatible with the module in question. Semantic versioning is a way to format version numbers and it looks like this: <code>v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}</code>. For example, <code>v1.2.3</code>.</p>



<p>Each number is to be incremented according to the following standards:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</code></pre>



<h2>Package-Side Problems</h2>



<p>Go has decided that all versions beyond <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> are required to use the major version in the module path. There are two ways to accomplish this. </p>



<p><strong>The first and recommended way</strong> is laid out in an example on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules#TOC_4." target="_blank">Go Blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>To start development on&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go</code>, we’ll create a new&nbsp;<code>v2/</code>&nbsp;directory and copy our package into it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, for every major version, we are encouraged to maintain a new copy of the entire codebase. This is also the only way to do it if you want pre-modules users to be able to use your package.</p>



<p><strong>The second way</strong> is to just change the name of your module in <code>go.mod</code>. Fore example, <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate</code> would become <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate/v2</code>. Besides this not working for older versions of Go, I also find it problematic because it breaks (in my mind) one of the most useful things about module names – they reflect the file path.</p>



<h2>Package-Side Solutions</h2>



<p>Allow package maintainers to specify the major version simply by updating git tags, no module name changes required. There is no need for two sources of truth.</p>



<p>We can enforce safe updating by adding warnings or prompts to the <code>go get</code> CLI. We don’t have to add unnecessary time-consuming policies.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Problems</h2>



<p>When new versions of dependencies are released we have a simple command to get the newest stuff: <code>go get -u</code>. The problem is that this command has no way to automatically update to a new major version. It will only download new minor changes and patches. There isn’t even a console message to inform you that a new major version exists!</p>



<p>That said, the reason for not auto-updating is clear, and to be fair, well-founded:</p>



<blockquote><p>If an old package and a new package have the same import path, the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.</p><cite><a href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import" rel="noopener">Import compatibility rule</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In other words, we should only increment major versions when making breaking changes, and if breaking changes are made they can’t have the same import path. While this makes sense, I think a simple console warning would have been a better solution than forcing a cumbersome updating strategy on the community.</p>



<p><strong>Another problem </strong>on the client-side is that we don’t only need to update <code>go.mod</code>, but we actually need to <code>grep</code> through our codebase and change each import statement to point to the new major version:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who wanted to use&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;had to change their package imports and module requirements to&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2</code>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Instead of a few simple CLI commands to get the latest dependencies, we’re making changes to the code itself.</p>



<h3>A Caveat – Diamond Imports</h3>



<p>Using different paths for different major versions makes more sense in situations where we may require two different versions of the same package, you know, <a aria-label="diamond imports (opens in a new tab)" href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import#dependency_story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">diamond imports</a> and all that. This is the exception, not the rule, and it seems strange to tap dance around a problem that doesn’t exist in most codebases.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Solution</h2>



<p><code>go get -u</code> should have an additional command line flag to update major versions, and should default to showing a warning that there is a newer major version you don’t have yet.</p>



<p><em>Default</em> import paths should not change between major versions. If a module requires various versions, those <em>extra</em> versions could be flagged by having a different path.</p>



<h2>Why This Sucks For Me</h2>



<p>It is often the case that I want to build a package that has domain-specific logic and will only be used only in services at the small company I work for. For example, we have a repo that holds the <code>struct{}</code> definitions for common entities used across our system.</p>



<p>Occasionally we need to make backward-incompatible changes to those struct definitions. If it were an open-source library we wouldn’t make changes so often, but because it’s internal and we are aware of all the dependencies, we change the names of exported fields <em>regularly</em>. We aren’t changing names because we chose bad ones to begin with, we are usually changing names because requirements from the business change rapidly in a startup. </p>



<p>This means major version changes are a fairly regular occurrence. Some say that we should just stay on <code>v0</code>, and that’s a reasonable solution. The problem is these ARE production packages that are being used by a wide number of services. We WANT to Semver.</p>



<p>Go makes updating major versions so cumbersome that in the majority of cases, we have opted to just increment minor versions when we should increment major versions. We want to follow the proper versioning scheme, we just don’t want to add the unnecessary steps to our dev process.</p>



<h2>Hey – I Get It</h2>



<p>I understand why these decisions were made – and I even think in a lot of cases they were great decisions. For any open-source or public facing module this makes great sense. The Go toolchain is enforcing strict rules that encourage good API design.</p>



<p>In their effort to make public APIs great, they made it unnecessarily hard to have good “local” package design.</p>



<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40323" rel="noopener">open issue on Github</a> that would make new major versions more discoverable from the CLI. Take a look at that if you are interested.</p>



<p>Go still has the best toolchain and ecosystem. NPM and PIP can suck it.</p>



<p>If you disagree, @ me on Twitter.</p>

<p>So you know when you’re flopping about at home, minding your own business, drinking from your water bottle in a way that does not possess <em>any</em> intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia?</p>

<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in “the group chat”<sup id="fnref:groupchat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:groupchat">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/groupchat.png" alt="Can you hack this man?|medium">
<em>A nice message from my friend, with a photo of a boarding pass 🙂 A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences 🙂🙂🙂</em></p>

<p>The man in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>, one of Australia’s <em>many</em> former Prime Ministers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png" alt="if u google tony abbott u get this|small">
<em>That’s him, officer</em></p>

<p>For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.<sup id="fnref:kevin07" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kevin07">2</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="the-boarding-pass-photo">The boarding pass photo</h4>
<p>This particular former PM had just posted a picture of his boarding pass on Instagram (Instagram, in case you don’t know it, is an app you can open up on your phone any time to look at ads).</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG" alt="Instagram post showing boarding pass|large">

<p>My friend<sup id="fnref:hoggemoade" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hoggemoade">3</a></sup> (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking<sup id="fnref:onbehalf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:onbehalf">4</a></sup> whether I can “hack this man” not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we’d recently been talking about boarding passes.</p>

<p>I’d said that people post pictures of their boarding passes all the time, not knowing that it can sometimes be used to get their passport number and stuff. They just post it being like “omg going on holidayyyy 😍😍😍”, unaware that they’re posting cringe.</p>

<em>People post their boarding passes all the time, because it’s not clear that they’re meant to be secret</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, some hacker is rubbing their hands together, being all “yumyum identity fraud 👀” in their dark web Discord, because this happens a <em>lot</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpassposts.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram"></p>

<hr>

<p>So there I was, making intense and meaningful eye contact with this chat bubble, asking me if I could “hack this man”.</p>

<h3 id="surely-you-wouldnt">Surely you wouldn’t</h3>
<p>Of course, my friend wasn’t <em>actually</em> asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.</p>



<p>However.</p>



<p>You <em>gotta</em>.</p>

<p>I mean… what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> click it? Are you gonna let a <em>link</em> that’s like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn’t you be <em>curious</em>?</p>

<p>The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Was that <em>bad</em>? Was someone in danger? I didn’t know.</p>

<p>What I did know was: the <em>least</em> I could do<sup id="fnref:nocrime" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nocrime">5</a></sup> for my country would be to have a casual browse 👀</p>

<h2 id="investigating-the-boarding-pass-photo">Investigating the boarding pass photo</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-hubris">Step 1: Hubris</h3>

<p>So I had a bit of a casual browse, and got the picture of the boarding pass, and then…. I didn’t know what was supposed to happen after that.</p>

<p>Well, I’d heard that it’s bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a bored 17 year-old Russian boy called “Katie-senpai” might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don’t know anyone like that, so I just clumsily googled some stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/uhhboardingpasshacking.png" alt="uhhh|small"></p>

<p>Eventually I found <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/">a blog post</a> explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can indeed be used for Crimes. The part you wanna be looking at for all your criming needs is the barcode, because it’s got the “Booking Reference” (e.g. <code>H8JA2A</code>) in it.</p>

<p>Why do you want the booking reference? It’s one of the two things you need to log in to the airline website to manage your flight.</p>

<p>The second one is your… last name. I was really hoping the second one would be like a password or something. But, no, it’s the booking reference the airline emails you and prints on your boarding pass. And it also lets you log in to the airline website?</p>

<p>That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but like I’m still fine to pretend it’s not if you are.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode">Step 2: Scan the barcode</h3>
<p>I’ve been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can’t scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn’t work :((</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png" alt="the boarding pass photo">
<em>Maybe I shouldn’t have blurred out the barcode first</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode-but-more">Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more</h3>

<p>Well, maybe it wasn’t scanning because the picture was too blurry.</p>

<p>I spent around 15 minutes in an “enhance, ENHANCE” montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn’t even get the barcode to scan<sup id="fnref:step3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:step3">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-notice-that-the-booking-reference-is-printed-right-there-on-the-paper">Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper</h3>

<p>After staring at this image for 15 minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is just… printed on the baggage receipt.</p>

<p>I graduated university.</p>

<p>But it did not prepare me for this.</p>

<p>After recovering from <em>that</em> emotional rollercoaster, I went to <a href="https://qantas.com.au/">qantas.com.au</a>, and clicked “Manage Booking”. In case you don’t know it because you live in a country with fast internet, Qantas is the main airline here in Australia.</p>

<p>(I also very conveniently started recording my screen, which is gonna pay off <em>big time</em> in just a moment.)</p>

<h3 id="step-4-type-in-the-booking-reference">Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference</h3>

<p>Well, the login form was just… <em>there</em>, and it was asking for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just flawlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well… I knew the last name<sup id="fnref:lastname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lastname">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I did hesitate for a split-second, but… no, I had to know.</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you really felt that.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/yikes.png" alt="yikes"></p>

<p>I guess I was now logged the heck in as Tony Abbott? And for all I know, everyone else who saw his Instagram post was right there with me. It’s kinda wholesome, to imagine us all there together. But also probably suboptimal in a governmental sense.</p>

<h5 id="was-there-anything-secret-in-here">Was there anything secret in here?</h5>

<p>I then just incredibly browsed the page, browsed it so hard.</p>

<p>I saw Tony Abbott’s name<sup id="fnref:name" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:name">8</a></sup>, flight times, and Frequent Flyer number, but not really anything <em>super</em> secret-looking. Not gonna be committing any cyber treason with a Frequent Flyer number. The flight was in the past, so I couldn’t change anything, either.</p>

<p>The page said the flight had been booked by a travel agent, so I guessed some information would be missing because of that.</p>

<p>I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length, but still didn’t find any government secrets.</p>

<p>Some people might give up here. But I, the Icarus of computers, was simply too dumb to know when to stop.</p>

<h3 id="were-not-done-just-because-a-web-page-says-were-done">We’re not done just because a <em>web page</em> says we’re done</h3>

<p>I wanted to see if there were juicy things hidden <em>inside</em> the page. To do it, I had to use the <em>only</em> hacker tool I know.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png" alt="Right click > Inspect-small">
<em>Right click &gt; Inspect Element, all you need to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia</em></p>

<p>Listen. This is the only part of the story that might be confused for highly elite computer skill. It’s not, though. Maybe later someone will show you this same thing to try and flex, acting like only <em>they</em> know how to do it. You will not go gently into that good night. You will refuse to acknowledge their flex, killing them instantly.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-inspect-element-work">How does “Inspect Element” work?</h5>
<p>“Inspect Element”, as it’s called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer’s internal representation (HTML) of the page you’re looking at. Kinda like opening up a clock and looking at the cool cog party inside.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Pocketwatch_cutaway_drawing.jpg" alt="cog party|small">
<em>Yeahhh go little cogs, look at ‘em absolutely going off. Now imagine this but with like, JavaScript</em></p>

<p>Everything you see when you use “Inspect Element” was already downloaded to your computer, you just hadn’t asked Chrome to show it to you yet. Just like how the cogs were already in the watch, you just hadn’t opened it up to look.</p>

<p>But let us dispense with frivolous cog talk. Cheap tricks such as “Inspect Element” are used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: Nobody can understand how websites work. Unfortunately, it kinda <em>looks</em> like hacking the first time you see it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to know more about it, I’ve prepared a short video.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey youtube welcome to my hacking tutorial, today we're gonna hack.... the nsa <a href="https://t.co/2Z35GJjSZE">pic.twitter.com/2Z35GJjSZE</a></p>— “Alex” (@mangopdf) <a href="https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2019</a></blockquote>


<h3 id="browsing-the-manage-booking-pages-html">Browsing the “Manage Booking” page’s HTML</h3>

<p>I scrolled around the page’s HTML, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.</p>

<p>I eventually realised that manually reading HTML with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F’d the HTML for “passport”.</p>

<h3 id="oh-no">oh no</h3>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/passportjson.gif" alt="Blurred screenshot of close up &quot;passport&quot; number"></p>

<h3 id="oh-yes">Oh yes</h3>

<p>It’s just <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I was fairly sure I was looking at the <em>extremely</em> secret government-issued ID of the <em>28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</em> and I was <em>kinda</em> worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop.</p>

<h3 id="anything-else-in-this-page">….anything <em>else</em> in this page?</h3>

<p>Well damn, if Tony Abbott’s passport number is in this treasure trove of computer spaghetti, maybe there’s wayyyyy more. Perhaps this HTML contains the lost launch codes to the Sydney Opera House, or Harold Holt<sup id="fnref:holt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:holt">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s a phone number?</p>

<p>Searching for <code>phone</code> and <code>number</code> didn’t get anywhere, so I searched for <code>614</code>, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number, using my colossal and highly celestial galaxy brain.</p>

<h5 id="weird-uppercase-letters">Weird uppercase letters</h5>
<p>A weird pile of what I could only describe as extremely uppercase letters came up. It looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 614[phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, there’s a lot going on here. There is indeed a phone number in here. But what the heck is all this <em>other</em> stuff?</p>

<p>I realised this was like… Qantas staff talking to eachother <em>about</em> Tony Abbott, but not <em>to</em> him?</p>

<p>In what is surely the subtweeting of the century, it has a …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ariss.org/">Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS)</a> team has announced the new ham radio FM repeater is now active aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as of September 2, 2020 at 1:02 GMT.</p>



<h2>Ham radio and the International Space Station</h2>



<p>Ham Radio operators have enjoyed making contact with the ISS for many years. The holy grail has always been<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93z5x_ulQVY"> talking to ISS astronauts on FM simplex (145.800)</a> — but those can be rare chance encounters. Ham radio operators have also enjoyed slow-scan television (SSTV) broadcasts and APRS packet radio via the ISS digipeater. Now we get to work the world’s most expensive FM repeater thanks to the new InterOperable Radio System (IORS) installed on the ISS.</p>



<p>The InterOperable Radio System (IORS) replaces an ancient Ericsson radio system and packet module that were certified for spaceflight over two decades ago. The 5 watt HT that was aboard the ISS was getting worn out after many years of use.&nbsp;The Ericsson radio looks like something from a 1990s episode of Cops.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="669" height="753" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio.jpg 669w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio-267x300.jpg 267w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ericcson_ISS_Radio-300x338.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"><figcaption>5-watt Ericcson radio aboard the International Space Station that has now been replaced by the new InterOperable Radio System (IORS) radio system.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The new IORS was launched from Kennedy Space Center on March 6, 2020 onboard the SpaceX CRS-20 resupply mission. It consists of a custom space-modified Kenwood D710GA transceiver and an ARISS-developed multi-voltage power supply. The equipment was installed by NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy (KF5KDR).</p>



<h2>New Kenwood D710G ‘Space Flight Edition’</h2>



<p>The radio now being used is a Kenwood D710G and was engineered specifically for space flight. JVCKENWOOD USA and the ARISS worked closely to modify the D710G. The upgrades were performed by JVCKENWOOD and include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Output power is hardware limited to 25 watts for the safety of the International Space Station</strong></li><li><strong>Custom firmware and menus tailored for operation onboard the ISS.</strong></li><li><strong>Higher output/high-reliability fan to allow continuous repeater operation.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Continuous fan operation is an important feature in space for the reliability of the radio. There is no convection in microgravity, so all heat-generating components need to be cooled by moving air or conduction. If the radio burns up, there isn’t a Ham Radio Outlet down the street to grab parts.</p>



<h2>Ham radio antennas on the International Space Station</h2>



<p>The ISS features four different vertical antennas on the spacecraft. The reason for four antennas is redundancy in case of an antenna failure.  They are made of flexible metal tape that are coated in Kapton, a polyimide film that can withstand extreme temperatures. The antennas are designed to withstand kick loads of 125 lbs.  </p>



<p>Three of the four antennas are identical and measure 0.5-meter (1.5 foot) in length and each can support both transmit and receive operations on 2 meters, 70 cm, L-band, and S-band. The fourth antenna has a 2.5-meter (8 foot) long vertical whip that can be used to support High Frequency (HF) operations, particularly on 10 meters. However, no HF radio is currently aboard the space station.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Challenges of ham radio in space</h2>



<p>One of the most significant challenges with installing ham radio equipment on the International Space Station is power. The Muliti-Voltage Power Supply (MVPS) that powers the radio has to operate from either 120VDC or 28VDC and meet both NASA and Russian requirements, which are different. NASA also has stringent and detailed safety and engineering requirements.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="451" height="284" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ISS_HamRadio_Power_Supply.jpg" alt="ISS Multi-Volt Power Supply" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ISS_HamRadio_Power_Supply.jpg 451w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ISS_HamRadio_Power_Supply-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"><figcaption>Multi-Volt Power Supply that will power the Kenwood D710 aboard the ISS</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The ARISS had to meet strict power quality and Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility&nbsp;specifications and limits. Even things like fan sound level, temperature rise, specific LED colors, special connectors, and non-flammable wiring. Even air filtering was a massive consideration as dust and lint are a real issue onboard the ISS.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>ARISS and getting ham radio aboard the ISS</h2>



<p>If you’ve made contact with the International Space Station in any way via ham radio you have the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) to thank. The group was created and is managed by an international working group, including several countries in Europe as well as Japan, Russia, Canada, and the United States of America. </p>



<p>The organization is run by volunteers from the national amateur radio organizations and the international AMSAT (Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation) organizations from each country. Since ARISS is international in scope, the team coordinates locally with their respective space agency&nbsp; and as an international team through ARISS working group meetings, teleconferences and webinars. </p>



<p>As you can imagine, the coordination between countries, space agencies, ham radio manufacturers and the ham community at-large is a time-intensive process — and it’s all volunteer. I urge you to consider <a href="https://www.ariss.org/donate.html">donating to the ARISS</a>. </p>



<h2>Trying the new ISS FM repeater</h2>



<p>I couldn’t wait to try the new FM repeater myself. During a recent pass I tried to make contact with my friend Dan, KB0TDW, in Council Bluffs, IA. </p>



<h3>ISS FM repeater information</h3>



<p><strong>Downlink</strong>: 437.800 +/- doppler</p>



<p><strong>Uplink:</strong> 145.990 (67hz PL Tone)</p>

I’ve added half again as many logos as well as updated many existing logos as new reference material has surfaced. I’ve put in quite a few hours, scouring for typefaces that may or may not exist, giving up and making things from scratch, and of course, finding that perfect reference to make something perfect. In the process, I’ve found lots of fun easter eggs, plenty of mistakes, and lots of friends who share the same love as I do of these particular logos and designs. I am so happy that I have been able to do as much as I have and I hope to continue in the coming year. Thanks to all of you who have supported me be it in materials submitted, advice, references, financial aid, linking, etc! I am very humbled by the community and will continue to try to support these as long as I can.</p><p>This is a personal project that I began working on once the Cyberpunk 2077 Gameplay reveal came out, remaking many of the assets that the game has to offer in terms of graphic design. Its diversity in styles makes it such a fantastic game to replicate and I hope that these will come in handy for anyone hoping to make their own custom assets along with any cosplayers, modelmakers, or printers who need these files to lend authenticity to their own work. I truly appreciate the amount of time and effort the team at CD Projekt Red and their designers/artists have put out towards making such a real and visceral world. I am very excited for the game and look forward to finding many more amazing examples of their fine handiwork!</p><p>If there is an asset you would like to see recreated from the game, trailer, or something else, <a href="https://www.valencygraphics.com/contact">please let me know</a>. My WIP list is at the end of this page, but subject to change as new logos are found. These logos are also subject to change due to the fact that I am working with low-res screenshots and odd angles when recreating the logos from reference, thus some proportions might be off, certain designs may be modified, or some fonts might be off completely. Just know that I tried my best and if anything, that’s just my extra “spin” on things for now. :)</p><p>Special thanks to Eli (<a href="https://twitter.com/hey_elium" target="_blank">@hey_elium</a>) for contributing a few of these logos as well as The Madqueen (<a href="https://twitter.com/MadqueenShow">@MadqueenShow</a>), herself!

<p><em>Hey, Aline (founder of interviewing.io) here. We’re trying something new. Up till now, all posts on this blog have been written by interviewing.io employees or contractors. Why? Frankly, it’s hard to find great content in the recruiting space. There’s so much fluff and bad advice out there, and we didn’t want any part of that.</em></p>



<p><em>The other day though, I was reading Hacker News and saw </em><a href="https://medium.com/@meekg33k/14-lessons-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days-7732e4f7608d?source=---------4------------------"><em>an article by Uduak Obong-Eren about how he did over 60 technical interviews in 30 days</em></a><em> and what he learned from that gauntlet of an experience. I thought it was honest, vulnerable, well-written, and brimming with actionable advice. So, I reached out to him to see if he’d want to write something else. Fortunately, he did, and the article below is the inaugural post in what I hope will become our Guest Author series. You can read more about Uduak in the bio below.</em></p>



<p><em>A quick note because this is the first time we’re doing this. One of the things I’m most excited about with this new Guest Author series is the diversity of opinions it will bring to our blog. Technical interviewing and hiring is fraught with controversy, and not everything these posts contain will be in line with my opinions or the official opinions of interviewing.io. But that’s what’s great about it. After over a decade in this business, I *still* don’t think there’s a right way to conduct interviews, and I think hiring is always going to be a bit of a mess because it’s a fundamentally human process. Even if we don’t always agree, I do promise that the content we put forth will be curated, high quality, and written by smart people who are passionate about this space.</em></p>



<p><em>Now, off we go!</em></p>

<p>What is the one thing you would look out for if you had to join a company?</p>



<p>Sometime between January and February 2020, I wanted to change jobs and was looking to join a new company. This, among other reasons, led me to embark on a marathon of technical interviews – <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-i-learned-from-doing-60-technical-interviews-in-30-days/">60+ technical interviews in 30 days</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doing that many number of interviews in such a short time meant I had an interesting mix of experiences from the various companies I interviewed with, each with their unique culture and values that often reflected in the way their interviews were conducted, intentionally or not.</p>



<p>In this article, I will be sharing some of the red flags I observed while I was on this marathon of technical interviews. I will not be mentioning names of any companies because that’s not the intent behind this article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of this article is also not to make you paranoid and be on the hunt for red flags in your next interview, far from it. Rather the goal is to equip you with knowledge to help you immediately identify exactly the same or similar red flags in your next interview<em>,</em> and hopefully identifying them will set you up to better handle them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though the stories I’ll be sharing come from my marathon of <em>technical </em>interviews, these red flags do not apply only to technical interviews. They apply to all kinds of interviews and so there’s a lot to learn here for everyone.</p>



<span>The Red Flags</span>




<span>Your interviewer is only open to solving the problem ONE way</span>



<p>In the world of computing and in life generally, for any given problem, there is typically more than one way to solve that problem. For example, given a sorting problem, you could solve it using a<a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort"> merge-sort</a> algorithm or a<a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/heap-sort"> heap sort</a> algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having this rich number of techniques to solve a problem makes it even more interesting and the general expectation in technical interviews is that you should have the flexibility to solve a problem using your preferred technique.</p>



<p>I had an interview where the interviewer asked me to solve an algorithmic problem. I had started solving the problem using a specific technique when the interviewer stopped me in my tracks and asked that I use another technique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I probed a bit further to know why, it appeared that the reason he asked that I used the second wasn’t to test my knowledge of that second technique; it was because he was more ‘comfortable’ with that approach.</p>



<p>It is different if the interviewer wants to test your knowledge of something very specific. For example, given a problem that can be solved using iteration and recursion, the interviewer may want to test your knowledge of recursion and can ask you to solve the problem recursively. That wasn’t the case here.</p>



<p>I ended up using both techniques and discussed the trade-offs but frankly that experience left a bad taste in my mouth especially because that interview was with the hiring manager — my would-be manager, who is someone that can significantly influence your career growth and trajectory.&nbsp;</p>



<span>Undue pressure to accept an offer letter</span>



<p>It’s very exciting and fulfilling when you go through all preliminary stages of a technical interview, through to the onsite interview (remote or in-person) and then you receive that “<em>Congratulations &lt;insert name here&gt;, we are pleased to offer you…</em>” email.</p>



<p>However, that excitement often becomes short-lived when there is some form of pressure from your soon-to-be employer to accept the offer. It’s a bit more manageable when the pressure comes from someone in HR or the recruiter, but when it’s from the hiring manager, that can be harder to manage.</p>



<p>That was the case for me when I interviewed with a startup based in Palo Alto. They were a small company in terms of staff strength. My onsite interview with them had gone quite well. I had a good conversation with the hiring manager and an even better conversation with the VP of Engineering, so much so that I could tell that I was going to be extended an offer. I asked to know how long I had to accept the offer letter and I was told seventy-two hours.</p>



<p>The offer letter arrived later that evening, and it looked great — a six-figure offer definitely didn’t seem like a bad start. I was also at the final stage of the interview process with other companies too and thankfully, I had enough time to negotiate and accept the offer, or so I thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the pressure started, incessant calls from the hiring manager and the VP of Engineering, back-to-back emails, all within the allotted time. So much was the pressure that it got to a point where I wasn’t sure I wanted to negotiate the offer anymore. I turned down the offer.</p>



<p>I turned down the offer because the experience got me thinking about the company’s work culture. Were the methods employed by the company to get me to accept the offer indicative of their work culture? If they needed to get something done, how far would they go?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now don’t get me wrong, yes the company wants to employ you, yes the recruiting team wants to ‘close the deal’ however, it’s very important to pay attention to how the company does this. Do they remain professional about it?</p>



<p>A company’s values go beyond what they say, it shows in what they do and how they do it.</p>



<span>Not enough clarity about your role</span>



<p>Among the many reasons why you would join a company is your desire to be involved in valuable work. I had the opportunity to join a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. They had contracted a recruiting agency to help them find someone to fill a Software Engineer position in their firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hiring process started with an exploratory interview with the recruiting agency closely followed by a second interview with a recruiter from the company. In both interviews, I couldn’t get a clear sense of the details of my specific role was — what team I would be on, what kinds of projects I’d be working on, what the career growth pathway was, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I understand that sometimes companies can be going through restructuring, but that didn’t seem to be the case here. It seemed more like the company was focused on completing their headcount. Even though there’s nothing wrong with completing a headcount, I think there is everything wrong with not having a clear purpose for a role for a couple of reasons:</p>



<ul><li>It means the role may not be critical to the company’s core business.</li><li>If the role isn’t that important, it may mean when a layoff comes, your position may be impacted.</li></ul>



<p>On a more personal note, I don’t want to be just a number. I want to work at a place where I have the opportunity to contribute in an impactful way, and I like to believe you would too. So it’s important to get clarity about your role, for where you are today and for future career growth.</p>



<span>Consistent lack of interest or low morale from interviewers</span>



<p>When looking to join a company, one of the things you simply must care about is the team you will end up working on. At least 25% of your waking hours will be spent interacting with that team whether in-person or virtually.</p>



<p>Interviews offer you an opportunity to experience firsthand what it will look like to work with your prospective teammates, especially since, unless you’re interviewing at a huge company, your interviewers are likely to become your teammates.</p>



<p>If through all the different stages of the interview process, you experience a <strong>consistent</strong> lack of interest or low morale from your interviewers, you might want to pay attention .&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I experienced that during one of my interviews, I couldn’t exactly tell what the cause was, but I knew something just wasn’t right. After some internal tussle, I decided to trust my gut feelings and ended the interview process with the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward to two months …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How is Google so fast? It’s so fast we take it for granted.  It feels instant from the time you search to when results are displayed.  What can we learn about the techniques they use to make their site so fast?</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="google-search-results-are-fast">Google Search Results are Fast</h2>
<p>The Google homepage is known for it’s speed, but that’s partly a function of how sparse it is.  For this discussion, let’s focus instead on the Google <strong>search results</strong> page.  There’s a lot more functionality and content, and it still loads incredibly fast.  Here we’re searching for “request metrics” from a mobile phone.</p>

<figure>
    <video controls="" muted="" preload="metadata">
        <source src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/results-load.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>Google Search Results for "Request Metrics"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Wow.  That is almost instant. If we compare the speed of Google’s search results to our <a href="https://requestmetrics.com/web-performance/performance-profiling-nike">web performance profile of Nike.com</a>, there’s no question which experience is preferable.  But how does Google load those results so quickly?</p>

<h3 id="search-result-page-statistics">Search Result Page Statistics</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the statistics for this page load (gathered in the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools)</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/page-load-totals.png" alt="Network resources loaded for search results">
</figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>130</strong> requests total to load the search results</li>
  <li><strong>707 KB</strong> of assets over the wire (compressed using gzip)</li>
  <li><strong>9</strong> JS files</li>
  <li><strong>104</strong> image files</li>
  <li><strong>0</strong> CSS files</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to many sites this is a “lightweight” page load, but there’s still over one hundred requests.  And there’s three quarters of a megabyte of assets shipped over the wire.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Google is using <strong>gzip</strong> for compression instead of their own <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">Brotli algorithm</a>, even though my browser will accept either.  In benchmarks <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/02/understanding-brotlis-potential.html">Brotli can be configured to increase compression and performance</a> compared to gzip, so it’s not clear why they’re making this choice.</p>

<p>Overall these statistics are OK, but they don’t explain the speed we see.  The most notable insight here is that there are <em>zero</em> external CSS files.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-the-styles-coming-from">Where are the styles coming from?</h4>
<p>The browser did not request a single CSS file, and yet the page is styled nicely. Let’s look at the HTML that we got back from Google to see if we can figure out where the styles are coming from.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-styles.png" alt="Inline styles">
    <figcaption>Inlined CSS in the page response.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They are inline!  Google is inlining the CSS and sending it out with the page response.  This allows the browser to render the styled content without waiting for an external resource to come back.  But Google doesn’t just inline CSS.</p>

<h2 id="inline-every-static-resource">Inline Every Static Resource</h2>
<p>Google takes inlining seriously.  Not only do they inline the styles, they inline their JavaScript!</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-script.png" alt="Inline scripts">
    <figcaption>Inlining JavaScript too.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In fact, we can run some selectors against the page to see just how pervasive the inlining of scripts and styles is.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-stats.png" alt="Inline scripts">
    <figcaption>Inline vs. external script and style resources.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that of <em>all</em> the scripts and styles on the page, everything is inlined except <strong>2</strong> external JavaScript files.  (<em>Note:</em> those two external scripts dynamically load additional JS files which is how we get <strong>9</strong> total on page load).</p>

<h3 id="what-if-we-dont-load-any-external-assets">What if We Don’t Load Any External Assets?</h3>
<p>To illustrate just how far Google has taken the concept of inlining static resources, let’s <em>only</em> load the HTML.  <strong>No other external assets</strong>.  No external JavaScript, no external images, no external anything.  I saved the HTML response from Google and opened it with my network turned off. How does it look?</p>

<figure>
    <video controls="" muted="" preload="metadata">
        <source src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/doc-only.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>The source HTML only.  No external assets.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It looks great!  There’s even favicons for all the search results.  The hamburger menu doesn’t work, and the images carousel towards the end is missing its images. But everything else looks pretty good.</p>

<p>Earlier we saw that <strong>104</strong> image files were loaded during the real page load.  And yet, we see most of the images working here.  What gives?</p>

<h3 id="inlining-images-with-data-uris">Inlining Images with Data URIs</h3>
<p>Google is using a clever optimization with most of the images.  If we look at the Request Metrics favicon image in the inspector we can see that the image has a special <code>src</code> URI - a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/">Data URI!</a> The binary image content is Base64 encoded and shoved directly into the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/base64-rm.png" alt="Data URI base64 encoded favicon">
    <figcaption>The Base64 encoded Request Metrics favicon Data URI source.</figcaption>

<p>Using Data URIs is yet another way Google shows their committment to inlining assets.  It’s a perfect technique to use when there’s many small images to display. The Data URI approach has diminishing returns for larger images since it bloats the page size. That’s why the “Images” carousel is blank - they are still using externally sourced images to populate that section.</p>

<p><em>Important:</em> It’s worth noting that each one of these Base64 encoded images is counted as a “request” in the Network tab of Chrome developer tools.   This explains why there are so many images “requested” but the page is so fast.  The browser never goes over the network to get them!  Here’s what they look like in the developer tools:</p>

<h3 id="inlining-for-speed">Inlining For Speed</h3>
<p>Google’s dedication to inlining JS, CSS and images shows how important it is for maximizing performance. Every external request the browser makes is a performance problem waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Google is taking no chances here.  Once a user’s browser receives that <em>very first</em> response from Google, it can render <strong>90%</strong> of the UI without going over the wire again.  This speeds things up and also mitigates slow or unreliable networks.</p>

<p>Of course, getting that first response to the user <em>quickly</em> is also important.  And 90% is not 100% - there <em>are</em> other requests necessary for a fully featured experience.  Inlining is not the only thing Google does to be fast.</p>

<h2 id="googles-fast-edge-network">Google’s Fast Edge Network</h2>
<p>Optimizing the content of a page is important, but perhaps equally important is delivering that page and its associated resources quickly over the wire.</p>

<h3 id="a-globally-distributed-infrastructure">A Globally Distributed Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Google runs <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure">a robust network with multiple layers of infrastructure</a> to ensure that requests are handled as close to the end user as possible.  They have numerous <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/net/433">peering arrangements</a> with ISPs around the world, and a comprehensive edge caching setup that ensures static resources are almost always nearby.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Areas with at least one Google Global Cache edge node.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/learn-more/faq">difficult to objectively measure</a> the performance of Google’s network with traditional tools like <code>ping</code>, but we can look at how things perform in our browser.</p>

<h3 id="the-initial-search-results-response">The Initial Search Results Response</h3>
<p>Here’s what the developer tools say about our search results loading times:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/doc-load.png" alt="Search results page load">
    <figcaption>Search results page load timing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial request to Google had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte">time to first byte</a> (TTFB) of <strong>145 ms</strong> (the blue box).  That is, the browser started receiving the response from Google after 145 milliseconds.  <a href="https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/">That’s pretty fast</a>. The overall time to finish reading the response was <strong>880 ms</strong> (orange box).  This includes the time to download the entire response from Google.</p>

<p>Remember, because of Google’s aggressive static content inlining, 90% of the UI can be displayed to the user once the response is finished.</p>

<h3 id="the-static-content-is-even-faster">The Static Content Is Even Faster</h3>
<p>There are a few external JavaScript files retrieved during page load.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/static-load.png" alt="JS file load times">
    <figcaption>JavaScript File Load Times</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These files all have an average TTFB of <strong>~30 ms</strong>. This suggests the server is nearby, with minimal hops between my browser.  Considering I loaded this page over a Comcast internet connection, this is a solid response time.</p>

<h4 id="the-protocol-makes-a-difference">The Protocol Makes A Difference</h4>
<p>Not only are the Google servers nearby, they’re also serving files using a new protocol.  You might have noticed the value <strong>h3-Q050</strong> in the screenshots above. That’s because the browser is talking to Google over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a>.</p>

<p>It’s still a draft standard, but the main difference between HTTP/3 and HTTP/2 is that TCP is no longer the underlying connection protocol.  They’ve adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> instead of TCP because it improves performance:</p>

<blockquote>
[QUIC] does this by establishing a number of multiplexed connections between two endpoints over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This works hand-in-hand with HTTP/2's multiplexed connections, allowing multiple streams of data to reach all the endpoints independently, and hence independent of packet losses involving other streams.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-be-fast-like-google">How to Be Fast, Like Google</h2>
<p>Most companies don’t have access to Google’s network or vast developer pool, but the same ideas they use to make their pages load quickly can be applied to any site.</p>

<h3 id="make-less-requests">Make Less Requests</h3>
<p>Google takes it to a new level, but avoiding network requests is major factor in improving web performance. Even with newer HTTP protocols, bundling assets to coalesce static content is still a good idea.  If you can inline some JavaScript or CSS that’s even better.  Using data URIs to transmit small images can also help. Networks are unreliable, and every request the browser makes has the potential to fail or be delayed.</p>

<p>Webpack is a staple in modern front-end tool chains, and there are several plugins that can help if you want to go the inlining route:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin">html-webpack-inline-source-plugin</a> - for inlining all CSS <em>and</em> JS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/">style-loader</a>- if you just want to inline your styles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/url-loader/">url-loader</a> - building Data URIs from images or other sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-cdns-and-modern-protocols">Use CDNs and Modern Protocols</h3>
<p>It’s unlikely you’ll have access to a network quite as sophisticated as Google’s, but modern cloud providers offer many similar features. Things like purpose-built CDNs and dynamic geo-based DNS routing are available to anyone.</p>

<p>Hosting static content on a CDN is an easy way to get some of the network benefits Google enjoys, including HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 support.  And using a geo-aware DNS solution let’s you take data locality to the next level if that’s important for your use case or customer base.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use the cloud, third parties like <a href="https://www.stackpath.com/maxcdn/">MaxCDN</a> and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> make it simple to deliver static content from around the globe.  And there are DNS providers like <a href="https://easydns.com/dns/pro/">easyDNS</a> offering full GeoDNS routing.</p>

<p>Google is one of the premier web properties on the Internet, and the company is driving many new web standards.  It’s no surprise their site is one of the fastest.  For everyone else, we’ve built <a href="https://requestmetrics.com/">Request Metrics</a>. Now you can see how your users really experience your site.</p>

          <p>We’re excited to release the first preview of Stargate, an open source API framework for data. This project came about because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done. With “read the manual” fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we created a new project, we thought - why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads? From this, Stargate was born.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re a JavaScript developer building a website, saving and searching JSON is great and maybe you also have some GraphQL sprinkled throughout. If you’re a Java or C# developer working on an enterprise application, SQL is likely more your style. The goal of Stargate is to make your data available for you through whatever API you can dream up regardless of the backing datastore.</p>

<p>So far we’ve started with Apache Cassandra as the first backend and implemented the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and a REST API for CRUD access to data in tables and have many more APIs coming soon.</p>

<p>For any project to thrive it needs to be easy to work with and contribute to. We kept that in mind while architecting Stargate and the core codebase is modularized to facilitate extensibility and collaboration. We hope that you’ll join us on this journey to redefine what’s possible when it comes to interacting with data at scale and if you’re interested in getting involved you can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate">GitHub</a>, join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users">mailing list</a>, or follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/stargateio">@stargateio</a>! 🚀</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate.png"></p>

<h2 id="how-does-stargate-work">How does Stargate work?</h2>

<p>Stargate is a data gateway component that is deployed between your client applications and database. We chose Cassandra as the first database because it solves the world’s hardest scale and availability challenges and we think there’s low hanging fruit in terms of APIs for the database.</p>

<p>Stargate itself is based on the concept of a Cassandra <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html">coordinator node</a> and is very similar to the “fat client” that Eric Lubow explains in his <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DataStax/optimizing-your-cluster-with-coordinator-nodes-eric-lubow-simplereach-cassandra-summit-2016">presentation</a> at Cassandra Summit in 2016. This means when Stargate is deployed, it joins the Cassandra cluster as a coordinator node but does not store any data. We chose this design because coordinator nodes in Cassandra already handle most of the request handling and routing that’s needed for a highly available storage proxy and it made sense to reuse that time-tested logic. This architecture allows for compute to be scaled independently of storage; a common model when using cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>The high-level architecture diagram below explains where Stargate fits in the stack and the vision for new APIs and integrations.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png"></p>

<p>Taking a closer look, when a request is sent to Stargate, it is handled by the API Service, translated to the database query, and dispatched to the Persistence Service. The Persistence service then sends the request to the storage replicas of that row using Cassandra’s internal QueryHandler. The Persistence Service processes the request and responds to the client once it receives acknowledgements from the number of storage replicas specified by the request consistency level.</p>

<p>This is a pretty classic implementation of “<a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo-based</a>” coordination. Stargate’s ultimate goal is to have pluggable APIs on the front-end and pluggable storage engines on the <em>back-end</em> with all the Dynamo magic happening in the middle.</p>

<p>To understand how this distributed coordination works a bit more, in a single 6-node datacenter cluster with 3 storage replicas, an incoming request will go to all 3 replicas that own the requested row. In this case, the nodes labeled 1, 3, and 4 are storages nodes that own the data for the request. In the example below, the consistency level is LOCAL_QUORUM which means that Stargate will read or write data to 2 of the 3 storage replicas in order to satisfy the client request and ack the success.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png"></p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
<p>Below is an example of the REST API for CRUD operations that serves the data stored in Cassandra tables over HTTP. You can try this example by downloading <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> and importing the Stargate REST API collection in the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/stargate-rest-api.postman_collection.json">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Pull down the docker image</strong> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio">https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio</a>)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">docker pull stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 2: Start the docker container</strong> using the <code>DEVELOPER_MODE=true</code> env variable. This removes the need to install a separate Cassandra instance.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  docker run <span>--name</span> stargate <span>-p</span> 8081:8081 <span>-p</span> 8082:8082 <span>-p</span> 127.0.0.1:9042:9042 <span>-d</span> <span>-e</span> <span>CLUSTER_NAME</span><span>=</span>stargate <span>-e</span> <span>CLUSTER_VERSION</span><span>=</span>3.11 <span>-e</span> <span>DEVELOPER_MODE</span><span>=</span><span>true </span>stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 3: Generate an auth token</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>-L</span> <span>-X</span> POST <span>'http://localhost:8081/v1/auth'</span> <span>-H</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
    "username": "cassandra",
    "password": "cassandra"
  }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"authToken"</span><span>:</span><span>"{auth-token-here}"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 4: Create a keyspace</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
      "name": "users_keyspace",
      "replicas": 1
    }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"users_keyspace"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create a table</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces/users_keyspace/tables'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
      "name": "users",
      "columnDefinitions": [
        {
          "name": "firstname",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "lastname",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "email",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "favorite color",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        }
      ],
      "primaryKey": {
        "partitionKey": ["firstname"],
        "clusteringKey": ["lastname"]
      },
      "tableOptions": {
        "defaultTimeToLive": 0,
        "clusteringExpression":[
          {
            "column": "lastname",
            "order": "ASC"
          }
        ]
      }
    }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"users"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 6: Add rows</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
    "firstname": "Mookie",
    "lastname": "Betts",
    "email": "mookie.betts@gmail.com",
    "favorite color": "blue"
  }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"firstname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Mookie"</span><span>,</span><span>"lastname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Betts"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 7: Get rows</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>-G</span> <span>--location</span> <span>'http://localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-urlencode</span> <span>'where={"firstname": {"$eq": "Mookie"}}'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"count"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"data"</span><span>:[{</span><span>"firstname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Mookie"</span><span>,</span><span>"favorite color"</span><span>:</span><span>"blue"</span><span>,</span><span>"email"</span><span>:</span><span>"mookie.betts@gmail.com"</span><span>,</span><span>"lastname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Betts"</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

September 15, 2020 | https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/15/emacs-prelude-1-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/15/emacs-prelude-1-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I’ve got a big news to share with you today - after (over) 9 years of
development, <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> finally made it to version 1.0! There’s nothing
really big or groundbreaking there, as Prelude has been in a pretty good place for a very
long time feature-wise, but I felt like tagging a 1.0 release, because it’s 2020 and
all sort of crazy things are happening the entire year. Most of you probably
don’t know this, but Prelude was one of my first open-source projects<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>,
that’s why making it to 1.0 means a great deal to me. Open-source projects are a
product of love, plain and simple.</p>

<p>I know that Prelude has probably lost some of its significance in the era of
Spacemacs, Doom Emacs, and a myriad other great Emacs distributions with more
features, sophisticated plugin systems, bells, whistles, kitchen sinks, and all that jazz, but
I don’t really care. I’m happy that we made it so far, I’m glad that Prelude was
the gateway to Emacs for many people, I’m proud of the community we’ve built,
I’m proud that it inspired many other distributions to go in different
directions, and I’m proud that Prelude always stood true to its core philosophy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simple</li>
  <li>easy to understand and extend</li>
  <li>stable</li>
  <li>a foundation for you to build upon, as opposed to some end-user product that you’re supposed to use as-is</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that it intentionally doesn’t pack all the bells and whistles that it could.
Prelude aims to enhance the classic Emacs experience without deviating a lot from it - e.g.
it would never enable something like <code>evil-mode</code> (vim keybindings) by default and so on.</p>

<p>All the third-party packages that it bundles are carefully vetted and are known to be of
good quality and to have reliable maintainers. That generally means that Prelude’s unlikely
to immediate adopt some shiny new package, that has established tried and true alternatives.</p>

<p>I know some people were pissed/disappointed that in recent years Prelude didn’t
change much, but for me this was never a problem - it was actually a feature, in
the same way that stability is a feature for Clojure. Fewer changes mean fewer
breakages, fewer things to learn, fewer confused users, etc. They also mean that
I believe that in terms of functionality and experience Prelude is where I want
it to be. Believe it or not, from time to time software projects are (mostly)
done.  Yeah, there’s always some room for more improvements, but after a certain
point the return on investment is simply not worth it (or even worse - it
becomes negative).</p>

<p>I’m always amused by how many people come to CIDER’s issue tracker reporting basic
issues with packages like <code>sayid</code> and <code>clj-refactor</code> (CIDER plugins) that were automatically
installed and enabled by their distribution. Most casual CIDER users don’t need those
packages and the complexity that comes with them, and power users can obviously
install and configure the packages themselves. That’s not a good user experience
in my book, and it’s a classic example of the power of the “less is more”
philosophy. Prelude bundles only CIDER (no extensions) and it just works.
Same with many other programming languages.</p>

<p>Rest assured that Prelude will continue to evolve in the future, but don’t
expect anything massive to change.  Lately I’ve been pondering switching to
<code>use-package</code> for the internals, although I don’t see a strong reason to do so,
and to leverage more of LSP here and there. Leveraging some Emacs 27 features is
also on the agenda. Better documentation would be an awesome improvement as
well!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>One thing I’ve vowed to do going forward is to keep a better track of changes
and to tag releases more often. As a result the project finally has a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> and
better contribution templates. I plan (hope) to cut a couple of “stable” releases 2-3
times a year. I also plan to find a couple of co-maintainers to ensure I can
retire quietly down the road, but I’m in no rush to do this.</p>

<p>I guess that was one pretty weird release announcement, but that’s the release
announcement I felt like writing.  Thanks to everyone who helped and used
Prelude for almost a decade! I love you all! Keep hacking!</p>

<p>I try to be a friendly citizen of the web. I try to keep my site in good
   shape. It should load quickly, track nothing beyond your basic server logs,
   not hassle you about cookies, GDPR or my newsletter. I do have a newsletter
   but it won't pop up in your face here. I try to stay firmly on the side of
   friendly and a good experience in how I run this site.
</p>
<p>I do these things because I want my site to be not just bearable but an
   actually great experience in its own quiet way. Just
   as important to me as replying to email in a reasonable timeframe, doing
   what I've told people I will and following up on things that require my
   attention. I try my best and I want this to also be true for my website.
   As a consequence it also happens to have a perfect Lighthouse score most
   of the time.
</p>
<p>A while back I had an idea that smells a bit funny.
   It has the scent of some poor web ethics. But it may also be a very useful.
   I'm not the first to discover it but I also haven't seen a lot about it.
   It seems to be usable for reasonable things but it is also somewhat
   abusable. Also, it definitely breaks the principle of least astonishment
   (or least surprise) in that it makes your browser do things you do not
   expect.
</p>
<p>I'm talking about <strong>tracking users via CSS</strong>. So one of the
   potential downsides of only knowing your traffic via server logs is that
   <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/server-log-analysis#the-total-number-of-unique-visitors">they are not a very good
      indicator of readership</a>
   as outlined by the Plausible Analytics people. Lots of automated traffic
   on the web, bots, crawlers and scrapers. So if there is a way that can
   remove most of the automated traffic without loading any JS, is that a win?
</p>
<p>Consider this CSS:</p>
<pre>    body:hover {
        background-image: url("https://underjord.io/you-was-tracked.png");
    }
</pre>
<p>There are endless ways to do it. This has a certain elegance because it
   actually requires mouse interaction. You could probably cover accessibility
   with some use of <code>:focus</code> as well. CSS won't load the URL until
   the selector is hit and it will only load it once for a given page view.
   You'd want a separate URL per page, which is trivial enough, query params
   would likely be enough. I'm convinced that this would give me better data.
</p>
<p><em>I am</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>going to be implementing it.</em>
   I think it's mostly fine to use things like Plausible or Fathom that are
   privacy-oriented analytics platforms because it is a lot better than what
   was going on before and I think the exchange between visitor and site isn't
   entirely clearcut. The negotiation is implicit and the browsers set the
   outer boundary terms. But what we do within that space is what determines
   our character. And I think the best way to serve my audience is to be
   mindful of this stuff, not stare myself blind at the numbers and keep
   working to maintain the trust and attention I've built up.
</p>
<p>The ugly side is that there are things that you can do to indicate every
   single link your users hover, even if they are blocking all JS. You can
   absolutely use this to do things I consider somewhat of an overstep that
   are probably just table stakes in the analytics space. One could also
   measure how long people stay using invisible animations, doing the same
   thing I believe.
</p>
<p>But it is a neat hack and I hadn't really thought about the possibility
   before. It is already somewhat known. I haven't checked who does and doesn't
   do this. So I figured I'd share. Because I do like a neat hack.
</p>
<p>If you want to register your opinion in the aggregate you can just click one
   of the following links and you and all the bots will be recorded in the
   server logs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://underjord.io/it-is-evil.html" target="_blank">It is evil</a></li>
<li><a href="https://underjord.io/it-is-not-evil.html" target="_blank">It is not evil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you draw your lines on privacy? Are there things sites are fine to
   do to understand their traffic and visitors or should even the server log
   be abolished?</p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious how you feel. Feel free to get in touch via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or just find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><hr><p><em>This is an automatic translation, we apologize for any mistakes. You can read the original spanish <a href="https://auamstrad.es/hardware/mundo-cpc/amstrad-cpc-472/">version here</a>.</em></p><hr><p><strong>The Amstrad CPC 472 is an 8-bit Microcomputer of the Amstrad brand, </strong>belonging to the classic range of <strong>CPC </strong>(<strong>Colour Personal Computer</strong>) and sold exclusively in Spain between 1985 and 1986. It is a personal computer almost identical to its predecessor, the CPC 464.</p><p>At the sight, it is only distinguished by the screen printing of the case, where the «64» is replaced by a «72», however, it has a particularity that <strong>makes it special: those extra 8 KB of RAM</strong> that indicates its name and that are accompanied by a hilarious and sometimes even crazy story. A succession of anecdotes, occurrences and arguing that will delight the most curious by the history of microinformatics.</p><p>For example, not everyone knows that <strong>t</strong>he CPC 472<strong> owes its existence to another 8-bit microcomputer: the Dragon</strong>. Had it not been for the emergence of Dragon computers in the Spanish computer scene, the Range of the Amstrad CPC would have gone from version 464 to 664 and completed in the 6128 (not counting the plus range). However, the Dragon brand was decisive for Amstrad to take out in Spain, and only in Spain, its version 472.</p><p><strong>How and why did it all happen?</strong> It’s a fascinating story, full of ambitious characters, business odagos, influence-trade and even palatial intrigue. But let’s start at the beginning….</p><h3>Dragon, the microcomputer made in Spain</h3><p>In 1982<strong>, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Data" target="_blank" aria-label="Dragon Data (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dragon Data</a> was a subsidiary of a British toy company called Mettoy,</strong> which then had financial problems. They get more funding from a number of sources, one of them bein<strong>g the Welsh Development Office</strong>. As a result, this UK-constituting nation moves the Dragon factory and began producing mass microcomputers.</p><p>However, after various commercial vicissitudes, in 1984 the majority distributor decided to abandon its distribution and try to settle the brand. Several bids from companies such as Tandy or Philips come into play, but eventually it was <strong>Spain’s</strong> Eurohard who bought Dragon’s<strong> right</strong>s for 150 million pesetas (almost one million euros), which accounted for less than a third of its real value. In principle, it seemed like a good deal.</p><figure><img width="640" height="499" src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg" alt="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-src-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w" srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w"><figcaption>Dragon 32</figcaption></figure><p>Eurohard’s di<strong>rective</strong> moved in the high circles of Spanish politics.

An appetizing and hearty candy for any company.</p><blockquote><p><em>Dragon computer ad in 1985</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, <strong>Eurohard’s leaders failed </strong>to convince the Minister of Education and Science, socialist <strong>José María Maravall</strong>, and the<strong> </strong>Athena project was eventually nurtured with mostly foreign teams (Olivetti, IBM, Fujitsu…), with MS-DOS-compatible PCs being preferred as an operating system. To be sure, foreign brands also had their contacts in important circles of power.</p><p>Despite the clarity of the technical specifications (including the 5 1/4 floppy disk), we can find on the Internet <a href="http://www.elmundodelspectrum.com/proyecto-atenea-conoceis-a-atenea/" target="_blank" aria-label="testimonials from people (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">testimonials from people</a> who had at their <strong>Amstrad CPC 6128 schools and even Spectrum without a disk drive</strong>, so it follows that the application of Project Athena was also not very strict. In any case, <strong>Eurohard’s management failed</strong> to take over this succulent business for its <strong>Dragons</strong> and, at most, a few microcomputers of the brand would manage to enter the Spanish classrooms, which was a major economic blow to the company’s ambitions.</p><h3>The Spanish tariff policy</h3><p>However, not all aces had fallen out of their sleeves. What <strong>Eurohard</strong> did<strong> </strong>get from the Spanish government, in this case the Minister of Economy and Finance<strong>, Carlos So<em>lchaga</em></strong><em>, was <a href="https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1985/07/25/pdfs/A23677-23677.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Royal Decree 1215/1985, of 17 July, amending certain subheadings of the customs tariff (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Royal Decree 1215/1985, of 17 July, amending certain subheadings of the customs tariff</a>,</em> which imposed the importation of a wide range of electronic machines and, in this way, it was intended to curb the interferences of foreign computer manufacturers on the Spanish market.

They had been overly ambitious with their tariff move. Business pressures from foreign groups did not wait. They counterattacked and forced the Spanish government to rectify its policy. As a result,<strong> something decisive happened </strong>for the appearance of the Amstrad CPC 472. Here’s how it happened.</p><h2>CPC 472 and Royal Decree «<em>express</em>«</h2><p>After the government’s summer holidays ended on August 28, 1985 and just a month after the first decree, there was a council of ministers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1058"><div><p>I spend a lot of time working remotely, and while I have a decently sized laptop, I often miss having a second monitor. I looked at USB monitors, but then I remembered my old 2014 Galaxy Tab. Could I use it as a second monitor? The answer is: yes!</p><p>This setup works via virtual output devices and VNC. It essentially creates a remote desktop session on your laptop, which you can view and even interact with from your tablet. It’ll technically work with any network-ready computing device for that matter, whether it’s a tablet, a phone, a Raspberry Pi, or even another laptop.</p><p>These instructions are for Linux. Any Linux distribution should work, but you <em>must</em> be using X.org, not Wayland. You’ll also need to install the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">Android Debug Bridge</a> (adb) and <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a>.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175">download the full script from GitHub</a>. This post explains how the script works and provides setup instructions.</p><h2>Step 1: Create a Virtual Output Device</h2><p>First, we need to create a virtual output device by configuring Xorg. Create a file named <code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-virtual.conf</code> and add the following contents:<br> <code>Section "Device"<br> </code><code>&nbsp;Identifier "intelgpu0"<br> Driver "intel"<br> Option "VirtualHeads" "1"<br> EndSection</code></p><p>The Identifier and Driver options will be different if your GPU is AMD or Nvidia. You can add more virtual outputs by changing the <code>VirtualHeads</code> option, but for now let’s keep it at one. Save the file, then log out and log back in to apply the changes. To confirm, run the <code>xrandr</code> command. You should see a line starting with <code>VIRTUAL1 disconnected</code>.</p><h2>Step 2: Configuring and Enabling the Virtual Display</h2><p>Now, we need to configure the virtual display by setting its resolution and placement relative to the primary display (i.e. the laptop screen).</p><p>Open the <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175"><code>create-android-display.sh</code></a> file in a text editor and change the following lines to match your specific setup:</p><ul><li><code>W=1920</code> and <code>H=1080</code> set the width and height of the virtual display. Set this to your tablet screen’s resolution.</li><li><code>VIRTUAL1</code> should match the name of the virtual display as reported by xrandr.</li><li><code>eDP1</code> should match the name of your primary display. You can use xrandr to confirm this as well.</li></ul><p>The line starting with <code>PW</code> uses xrandr to get the width of the primary display. We’ll use this later on when creating the VNC session.</p><p>The lines starting with <code>gtf</code> configure the display and set its position relative to the primary display. In the third line, you can change where the display is located by changing <code>--right-of</code> to <code>--left-of</code>, <code>--above</code>, or <code>--below</code>.&nbsp;These instructions assume you’re using <code>--right-of</code>, so if you decide to change the placement, note that you’ll need to change the crop options when running x11vnc.</p><h2>Step 3: Create a VNC Session</h2><p>For VNC, we’ll use <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a> because it can expose an existing Xorg session without requiring root permissions. We’ll use the <code>-clip</code> option to restrict the visible area to the virtual monitor.&nbsp;We’ll also use <code>-localhost</code> to prevent x11vnc from exposing the session over the network for better security.</p><p><code>x11vnc -localhost -clip ${W}x${H}+${PW}+0</code></p><p>Some 3D applications and compositing window managers don’t work well over VNC, so if your screen isn’t updating, try adding <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/faq.html#faq-beryl"><code>-noxdamage</code></a>&nbsp;to the command.</p><h2>Step 4: Create an ADB Session</h2><p>VNC software uses port 5900 by default. However, since we ran x11vnc with <code>-localhost</code>, only software running on the laptop itself can access the VNC session. Fortunately, we can use adb to forward port 5900 on our laptop to port 5900 on our tablet. With port forwarding enabled, our tablet can access x11vnc as if it was coming from localhost.</p><p>We’ll forward the port with the command:</p><p><code>adb reverse tcp:5900 tcp:5900</code></p><h2>Step 5: Connect From Your Tablet</h2><p>The final step is to use a VNC viewer app on your tablet to open the x11vnc session. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.freebVNC&amp;hl=en_US">bVNC</a>, but any viewer app will work.</p><p>From the app, enter <code>localhost</code> as the target and click connect. In a moment, you should see your virtual monitor appear on screen. Move your cursor around, drag windows, and watch them appear on your tablet! Once you disconnect, the script automatically turns off the virtual display on your laptop so you don’t have “invisible windows” floating off-screen.</p><figure id="attachment_1062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1062"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;ssl=1" alt="Using an Android tablet as a second monitor" width="656" height="875" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1062">Kate and Konsole on an Android tablet via VNC.</figcaption></figure><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>VNC isn’t a perfect protocol, and it can be slow even over USB. It’s alright for web browsing and Slack/Discord, but I wouldn’t use it to watch movies. You <em>can</em> use VNC over the network, but this comes with some severe security implications. Make sure you enable encryption and password protection before exposing your desktop to <em>any</em> network.</p><p>One problem I couldn’t completely resolve was black bars appearing on my tablet when the tablet resolution was different from the laptop resolution. The bars completely covered the desktop and any windows I had on the screen. My only solution was to use the same resolution for both the laptop and the tablet, but this was workable for me.</p><p>Have any issues, thoughts, or suggestions? Leave a comment!</p></div></article></div>]]>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
Let's say we want to reduce the number of colors in an image. For example consider the image of fruit below:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit.jpg" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
If we run a count of how many colors are in the above image we get a whopping 157376 (for a 900 x 450 pixel image). Are all those colors really necessary?
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The image above has 16 colors and the one below only has 8.
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-8-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The problem of color palette reduction has been studied extensively and the typical approach works roughly as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a reduced color palette of size N by dividing the color space up into N distinct regions where each region is represented by one color. This is usually accomplished by one of several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_quantization">popular approaches</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dither</a> the image. The process of dithering eliminates color banding and creates the illusion of more colors through a stippling like effect. If you are not familar with dithering we will explore it in more detail later. Given a fixed color palette there are specialized algorithms for dithering such as <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/559-s2004/docs/floyd-steinberg.pdf">Floyd Stienberg</a>.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of the usual approach, we are going to solve both of these problems at the same time using gradient descent.  </p>
<p>First of all let's define a palette of N colors. For this article the colors will be 3 component vectors in rgb space. A quick warning to graphics nerds, for portability and simplicity we do not take <a href="http://xahlee.info/img/what_is_gamma_correction.html">gamma correction</a> into account.</p>
<p>Now how do we assign a discrete set of colors to pixels in a differentiable way? I decided to do this using probability distributions. Each pixel is represented by a vector containing the probabilities of each palette color being chosen for that pixel. When actually generating an image we just sample each pixel's color from it's distribution.  </p>
<p>The above formulation is pretty general. Importantly both the colors in the palette and the mapping of image pixels to palette colors are variables which we can optimize over simultaneously. Now all we need to do is attach any one of a number of loss functions.   </p>
<p>The loss function I chose to use at first was just the squared difference between the original image and the expected value of the output image:  </p>
<p><span>\(loss(output, target)=\sum_{i\in pixels}(target_i\)</span> <span>\(-\)</span> <span>\(E[output_i])^2\)</span> (equation 1)  </p>
<p>So what's the idea here? Basically the expected output allows our image to pretend it has more colors than it really does.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/dither-grey.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>For example let's pretend our palette has only two colors, black and white. Also suppose our target image is a 50% gray square. Consider the following three possible representations of the image. One is an all black image, one is all white and the third has 50% black and 50% white pixels randomly distributed across the image. If we look from far away the third image will look better. This is because the black and white pixels will blur together and appear gray. This effect is called dithering.   </p>
<p>By the above reasoning we want to make sure that the dithered pixel assignment (each pixel has a 50% chance of being black or white) should appear more desirable than the other two candidates to our loss function. Taking the squared error between the target image and the expected color of each pixel does exactly this.   </p>
<p>You might be asking, why not take the expected value of the whole squared error? This would look like:</p>
<p><span>\(loss(output, target) = E[\sum_{i\in pixels}(target_i\)</span> <span>\(-\)</span> <span>\(output_i)^2]\)</span>    </p>
<p>This actually does not work. To see why, let's look at the same setup as above and consider the expectation of an individual pixel (for math sticklers we can do this because expectation is linear). The loss function for a pixel denoted by the random variable <span>\(X\)</span> that always chooses black is: </p>
<p><span>\(E[(0.5 - X)^2] = (0.5 - 0)^2 = 0.25\)</span>   </p>
<p>And the loss function for a pixel denoted by the random <span>\(X\)</span> which is 50% black and 50% white is:</p>
<p><span>\(E[(0.5-X)^2] = (0.5-0)^2 * 0.5\)</span> <span>\(+\)</span> <span>\((0.5-1)^2 * 0.5 = 0.25\)</span>  </p>
<p>Unfortunately the values here are the same in both cases which rules out this loss function.  </p>
<p>Let's try using the loss from equation 1 with a palette of two colors:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-2-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>Hey! Not too bad! As we can see, different shades are captured by different densities of darker pixels. For a starker example let's try this image of a vertical black and white gradient:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/bw-grad.png" width="25%"> 
        <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/bw-grad-2.png" width="25%">
    </p> 


<p>Now let's try 16 colors:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-noisy.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The above image highlights one weakness of our current loss function. It's very noisy, even when it doesn't have to be.   </p>
<p>To give an extreme example, consider an image with three colors red, blue and purple (a mix of 50% red and 50% blue). Let's say we have room for 3 colors in our palette. In the eyes of equation 1 both of the following solutions would have the same loss:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The red pixels are red, the blue pixels are blue and the purple pixels are purple. We are using all three colors in our palette to the best of our ability and the image is reproduced perfectly.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each red pixel is red, each blue pixel is blue, each purple pixel has a <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of being red and a <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of being blue. Notice here we only use two out of three possible colors and the final image is clearly lower quality.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To control for this weakness, I added an additional term to the loss function which penalizes the sum of the pixel variances. Right now I just hand tune the coefficient of the variance penalty. A good rule of thumb seems to be larger palettes should weigh variance more heavily. Applying this penalty (variance coefficient = 0.25) gives us the 16 color image from the top of this post:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p>   
<p>The tradeoff is that too little variance removes noise which, due to the absence of dithering, makes the final image appear to contain fewer colors and also creates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding">banding effects</a>. The image below has 16 colors and variance coefficient = 1.0. It demonstrates both of these problems:<br>
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-saturated.png" width="50%"> 
</p>   
<p>Note there are many valid choices of loss function here and I'm not claiming mine is perfect at all. For example <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/12/23/c-differentiable-programming-searching-for-an-optimal-dither-pattern/">this article</a> on creating optimal dither patterns blurs both images and takes the difference between those. We could try to use this idea or search for something else to replace our simple squared error. It would also be interesting to try to use a real image quality metric like <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/">SSIM</a> to measure image quality instead of using variance as a proxy.   </p>
<p>Another place for improvement is that our approach is sloooow (up to several minutes). It also does not scale well memory wise to large palettes (when I try using more than 200 colors for the 900x450 pixel fruit image my colab notebook runs out of ram). This is because in that case there are more than 200x950x450 variables to optimize over. We could potentially tackle these problems in two ways. To address speed we could try to break the image up into mini batches. To address memory usage we could try to use a neural network to output probabilities at each pixel location instead of storing them all explicitly.   </p>
<p><strong>Why do I think this approach is interesting?</strong><br>
Although this approach is not state of the art by any means in either speed or quality I think it's interesting that we can optimize both the palette selection and dithering at the same time.  </p>
<p>As far as I know dithering and palette selection aren't really part of state of the art lossy compression today. However it would be neat if these same concepts could be applied to something like the color space transform, discrete cosine transform and weight quantization steps of <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~web6140/TopTenAlgorithms/JPEG.html">jpeg compression</a>.  </p>
<p>A pipedream would be an entirely differentiable image compression pipeline where all the steps can be fine tuned together to optimize a particular image with respect to any differentiable loss function.</p>
