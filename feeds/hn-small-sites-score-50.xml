        <p><span>At Uber, real-time analytics allow us to attain business insights and operational efficiency, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to improve experiences on the Uber platform. For example, our operations team relies on data to monitor the market health and spot potential issues on our platform; software powered by machine learning models leverages data to predict rider supply and driver demand; and data scientists use data to improve machine learning models for better forecasting. </span></p>
<p><span>In the past, we have utilized many third-party database solutions for real-time analytics, but none were able to simultaneously address all of our functional, scalability, performance, cost, and operational requirements. </span></p>
<p><span>Released in November 2018, AresDB is an open source, real-time analytics engine that leverages an unconventional power source, graphics processing units (GPUs), to enable our analytics to grow at scale. An emerging tool for real-time analytics, GPU technology has advanced significantly over the years, making it a perfect fit for real-time computation and data processing in parallel. </span></p>
<p><span>In the following sections, we describe the design of AresDB and how this powerful solution for real-time analytics has allowed us to more performatively and efficiently unify, simplify, and improve Uber’s real-time analytics database solutions. After reading this article, we hope you try out AresDB for your own projects and find the tool useful your own analytics needs, too! </span></p>
<h3>Real-time analytics applications at Uber</h3>
<p><span>Data analytics are crucial to the success of Uber’s business. Among other functions, these analytics are used to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Build </span><b>dashboards</b><span> to monitor our business metrics</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>automated decisions</b><span> (such as </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/drive/partner-app/how-surge-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>trip pricing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/advanced-technologies-detecting-preventing-fraud-uber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>fraud detection</span></a><span>) based on aggregated metrics that we collect</span></li>
<li><span>Make </span><b>ad hoc queries</b><span> to diagnose and troubleshoot business operations issues</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We can summarize these functions into categories with different requirements as follows:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>Dashboards</b></td>
<td><b>Decision Systems</b></td>
<td><b>Ad hoc Queries</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Pattern</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Well known</span></td>
<td><span>Arbitrary </span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query QPS</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Query Latency</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>Low</span></td>
<td><span>High</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Dataset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>Subset</span></td>
<td><span>All data</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span>Dashboards and decision systems leverage real-time analytical systems to make similar queries over relatively small, yet highly valuable, subsets of data (with maximum data freshness) at high QPS and low latency.</span></p>
<h4>The need for another analytical engine</h4>
<p><span>The most common problem that real-time analytics solves at Uber is how to compute time series aggregates, calculations that give us insight into the user experience so we can improve our services accordingly. With these computations, we can request metrics by specific dimensions (such as day, hour, city ID, and trip status) over a time range on arbitrarily filtered (or sometimes joined) data. Over the years, Uber has deployed multiple solutions to solve this problem in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the third-party solutions we’ve used for solving this type of problem include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Apache Pinot</b></a><span>, an open source distributed analytical database written in Java, can be leveraged for large-scale data analytics. Pinot employs a lambda architecture internally to query batch and real-time data in columnar storage, uses inverted bitmap index for filtering, and relies on star-tree for aggregate result caching. However, it does not support key-based deduplication, upsert, joins, and advanced query features such as geo-spatial-filtering. In addition, being a JVM-based database, query execution on Pinot runs at a higher cost in terms of memory usage.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Elasticsearch</b></a><span> is used at Uber for a variety of streaming analytics needs. It was built on Apache </span><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Lucene</span></a><span> for full-text keyword search that stores documents and inverted index. It has been widely adopted and extended to also support aggregates. The inverted index enables filtering, yet it is not optimized for time range-based storage and filtering. It stores records as JSON documents, imposing additional storage and query access overhead. Like Pinot, Elasticsearch is a JVM-based database, and as such, does not support joins and its query execution runs at a higher memory cost. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>While these technologies have strengths of their own, they lacked crucial functionalities for our use case. We needed a unified, simplified, and optimized solution, and thought outside-of-the-box (or rather, inside the GPU) to reach a solution.</span></p>
<h3>Leveraging GPUs for real-time analytics</h3>
<p><span>To render realistic views of images at a high frame rate, GPUs process a massive amount of geometries and pixels in parallel at high speed. While the clock-rate increase for processing units has plateaued over the past few years, the number of transistors on a chip has only increased per </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Moore’s law</span></a><span>. As a result, GPU computation speeds, measured in Gigaflops per second (GFLOP/s), are rapidly increasing. Figure 1, below, depicts the theoretical GFLOP/s trend comparing NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs over the years:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5345"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="314" srcset="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2.png 1999w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-300x157.png 300w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-768x402.png 768w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1024x536.png 1024w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-696x365.png 696w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1068x559.png 1068w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-802x420.png 802w, https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image11-2-1920x1006.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5345">Figure 1: Comparison of CPU and GPU single precision floating point performance through the years.

<p><span>When designing our real-time analytics querying engine, integrating GPU processing was a natural fit. At Uber, the typical real-time analytical query processes a few days of data with millions to billions of records and then filters and aggregates them in a short amount of time. This computation task fits perfectly into the parallel processing model of general purpose GPUs because they:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Process data in parallel very quickly. </span></li>
<li><span>Deliver greater computation throughput (GFLOPS/s), making them a good fit for heavy computation tasks (per unit data) that can be parallelized. </span></li>
<li><span>Offer greater compute-to-storage (ALU to GPU global memory) data access throughput (not latency) compared to central processing units (CPUs), making them ideal for processing I/O (memory)-bound parallel tasks that require a massive amount of data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Once we settled on using a GPU-based analytical database, we assessed a few existing analytics solutions that leveraged GPUs for our needs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kinetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Kinetica</b></a><span>, a GPU-based analytics engine, was initially marketed towards U.S. military and intelligence applications in 2009. While it demonstrates the great potential of GPU technology in analytics, we found many key features missing</span> <span>for our use case, including </span><span>schema alteration, partial insertion or updates, data compression, column-level memory/disk retention configuration, and join by geospatial relationships.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.omnisci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>OmniSci</b></a><span>, an open source, SQL-based query engine, seemed like a promising option, but as we evaluated the product, we realized that it did not have critical</span><span> features for Uber’s use case, such as deduplication. While </span><span>OminiSci</span> <span>open sourced their project in 2017, after some analysis of their C++-based solution, we concluded that neither contributing back nor forking their codebase was viable.</span></li>
<li><span>GPU-based real-time analytics engines, including </span><a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/gpuqp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUQP</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://cogadb.dfki.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>CoGaDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p817-yuan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GPUDB</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p709-heimel.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Ocelot</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol6/p1374-he.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>OmniDB</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://github.com/bakks/virginian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Virginian</span></a><span>, are frequently used by academic institutions. However, given their academic purpose, these solutions focus on developing algorithms and designing proof of concepts as opposed to handling real-world production scenarios. For this reason, we discounted them for our scope and scale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Overall, </span><span>these engines</span><span> demonstrate the great advantage and potential of data processing using GPU technology, and they inspired us to build our own GPU-based, real-time analytics solution tailored to Uber’s needs. With these concepts in mind, we built and open sourced AresDB.</span></p>
<h3>AresDB architecture overview</h3>
<p><span>At a high level, AresDB stores most of its data in host memory (RAM that is connected to CPUs), handling data ingestion using CPUs and data recovery via disks. At query time, AresDB transfers data from host memory to GPU memory for parallel processing on GPU. As shown in Figure 2, below, AresDB consists of a memory store, a meta datastore, and a disk store:</span></p>

<h4>Tables</h4>
<p><span>Unlike most </span><span>relational database management systems (</span><span>RDBMSs), there is no database or schema scope in AresDB. All tables belong to the same scope in the same AresDB cluster/instance, enabling users to refer to them directly. Users store their data as fact tables and dimension tables.</span></p>
<h5>Fact table</h5>
<p><span>A fact table stores an infinite stream of time series events. Users use a fact table to store events/facts that are happening in real time, and each event is associated with an event time, with the table often queried by the event time. An example of the type of information stored by fact tables are trips, where each trip is an event and the trip request time is often designated as the event time. In case an event has multiple timestamps associated with it, only one timestamp is designated as the time of the event displayed in the fact table.</span></p>
<h5>Dimension table</h5>
<p><span>A dimension table stores current properties for entities (including cities, clients, and drivers). For example, users can store city information, such as city name, time zone, and country, in a dimension table. Compared to fact tables, which grow infinitely over time, dimension tables are always bounded by size (e.g., for Uber, the cities table is bounded by the actual number of cities in the world). Dimension tables do not need a special time column.</span></p>
<h4>Data types</h4>

<p>It’s a common narrative in tech to design products with the assumption that users are stupid and lazy. I think that is both disrespectful and wrong.</p>



<p>The idea is rooted in a lot of research around product usability, but it has been bastardized. Thing of it as a perversion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think">Don’t Make Me Think</a> thesis.</p>



<p><em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, the seminal web usability book by Steve Krug, tells us that products should be as simple as possible for users to use. Products shouldn’t be self-explanatory (ie understandable given a set of instructions), they should be self-evident (ie so obvious that they can be used <em>without</em> having to read instructions). A good door has a push/pull sign to make it self-explanatory, but it still requires you to read and think. An even better door wouldn’t even need that label at all—you know what to do instinctively.</p>



<p>But somehow, we’ve perverted that idea. Users are lazy, even stupid, we say. They just want to flick their fingers down an infinite feed, letting their eyes wander from item to item.</p>



<p>But in <em>Don’t Make Me Think</em>, Krug never refers to users in a derogatory way. He tells us how good products should work, and why basic psychology supports that. People want to reduce cognitive friction as much as possible. People don’t like unneeded cognitive friction. People skim quickly and “muddle through” products. And, most of all, people won’t undertake effort unless they believe it’s worth the cost. These are all facts backed by usability research and psychology.</p>



<p>In other words, he tells us <em>what</em> good products should look like, and <em>how</em> people use them. But he doesn’t pass judgment on users. That’s up to us.</p>



<p>And so naturally, we apply our view of the world, our values. If you view your users with contempt, then the reason behind why people don’t like complicated products is because they are stupid and lazy. If, on the other hand, you <em>respect</em> your users, you might view things differently.</p>



<p>Firstly, our brains have been wired, through millions of years of evolution, to conserve effort and time. That’s actually not being lazy, it’s being smart and protective of one of our most valuable assets. Naturally, we don’t undertake an activity unless we believe it’s worth the cost (though there are ways to trick us, more on that later). And if it takes effort to even figure out how much effort an activity will require, we’ll avoid that activity altogether. That’s the functional, practical piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>Secondly, we are a complex bundle of emotions. Even if we’re smart, we don’t like <em>feeling</em> stupid. And complex, difficult things makes us feel stupid. They strike at our very identity and self-worth. So we try to avoid them like we avoid that hard topic we were never good at in school. <em>That</em> part is the emotional piece of our brain at work.</p>



<p>So what explains the rise of products like Facebook, which have gotten a large part of humanity mindlessly scrolling through feeds of what can most easily be described as garbage content? Well, we humans aren’t perfect. If you’ve got billions of dollars, some of the brightest minds, and a lot of data at your disposal, you can get a lot of people to do what you want. If you treat users as stupid and lazy, you can turn them into stupid and lazy people in the context of your product… but that’s a subject for another post.</p>



<p>So here’s how I think about people and product design.</p>



<p>Firstly, products should definitely be as simple as possible. Because I <em>respect </em>users’ time, not because I look down on their intelligence.</p>



<p>Second, have a theory of how people behave. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory">Self-determination Theory</a>, which states that people value autonomy, relatedness, and competence. And I love building product that help people improve all those three dimensions.</p>



<p>Three, have a set of principles for your product. For instance, of the three axes of self-determination, I particularly care about autonomy (control). And I’ve found that good products, ones that respect their users, <em>give them more control</em>. Bad products <em>take away control</em>. Simplicity can fulfill both of those purposes. It can give people control by abstracting away things they don’t care about and helping them focus. Or it can take away control by only letting users do things the product’s designers want them to do. So that’s one of my principles: give people control. Help them do things <em>they </em>want to do, not things <em>you</em> want them to do.</p>



<p>Let’s respect our users. Technology can bring out the best or worst in us, both individually and collectively. Let’s focus on the best.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The above article is what I wrote, in its half-formed state on a Sunday morning. It looks like it’s blowing up on HackerNews, so I wanted to just add a few points.</p>



<ul><li>I know I can come across as idealistic. I’ve even gotten that as feedback on a formal performance review (but also, I’ve gotten that I’m cynical, so *shrug*). I’m not saying people can’t be lazy, entitled, or stupid. We can. We have that <em>capacity</em>. But we have the <em>capacity</em> for so much more than that. And we should focus our tools, our technology, on our best capacities.</li><li>If Self-determination Theory resonates with you, I’d urge you to think about how it applies to building teams or even parenting. Your employees and colleagues, or your children and family members, have all the human capacities as well (though obviously, for children, they are still under development). Since I’m much more experienced at managing teams (dozen years) than being a parent (two years), I’ll just say that companies that view employees as lazy and incompetent are a scourge. If you can afford to avoid working at companies like that, try your best. And if you’re tasked with building companies or teams, you get to choose. You still need rules, hierarchies, and processes, but if you give people autonomy and relatedness/purpose, and trust their competence, I hope you’ll be pleasantly surprised. If you treat employees as stupid and lazy, they will be.</li><li>On simplicity vs. control/flexibility: I’m a big fan of the Alan Kay quote that “<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible</a>.” I think great products find a way of achieving both those objectives. You keep things simple, but don’t throw out the baby with the bath-water. Like the word processor. 99% of the time, you just want to type some text, so you get a cursor and WYSIWIG typing. But sometimes, you want to style, you want to indent, you want to program macros. We apply this principle often at <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/">Monarch Money</a> (personal finance platform that I’m working on) and so far have found it to be quite successful.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post covers why I believe local and national governments should
adopt and invest in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free and Open Source Software</a> (FOSS).</p>

<p>This has been in the news recently due to the city of Munich renewing 
it’s <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-not-windows-why-munich-is-shifting-back-from-microsoft-to-open-source-again/">LiMux Linux distribution</a>
thanks to an agreement between the local SDP and Green politicians, and
the efforts of the <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money, Public Code</a> campaign.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>

<h2 id="limux">LiMux</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux">LiMux</a> is a project by the German city of Munich to migrate its desktop
infrastructure to FOSS solutions, specifically to the LiMux Linux
distribution (based on Ubuntu) and LibreOffice (initially to OpenOffice). The project was started in 2004, and
migration began in 2006.</p>

<p>By the end of 2013, 15,000 desktops had been migrated successfully.
However, in September 2016 <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-germany-moves-into-a-new-headquarters/">Microsoft announced the opening of a new headquarters in Munich</a>, and then
in 2017 the <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/end-of-an-open-source-era-linux-pioneer-munich-confirms-switch-to-windows-10/">city council decided to switch back to Microsoft Windows and Office</a>.
The timing of this decision led to many accusations of effective
bribery, using the potential office opening to pressure the council in to using
Microsoft products (note that there is no evidence of a kick-back scheme
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-pay-25m-to-doj-and-sec-in-hungary-bribery-case/">like practiced by Microsoft Hungary</a>).</p>

<p>Fortunately <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200506-01.en.html">this decision has now been reversed</a>, and LiMux 
development and roll-out will continue.</p>

<h2 id="other-cities">Other cities</h2>

<p>Munich is not the only city choosing Free Software solutions, many
others are beginning to see the potential benefits too. In Catalonia,
Barcelona’s <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/es/transformacion-digital/tecnologia-para-un-gobierno-mejor/software-libre">Digital Transformation programme supports Free Software</a>.
From first-hand experience this means that the government transport /
road organisation use LibreOffice for all documents - so local driving
schools, etc. do not need a copy of Microsoft Office to handle the
necessary digital paperwork.</p>

<p>In Valencia, <a href="https://www.muylinux.com/2013/08/22/generalitat-valenciana-libreoffice/">the local government migrated its administration and
schools to LibreOffice</a>
saving 1.5 million euros per year, and saving students and other
end-users from having to purchase their own copies of Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>However, it is not always straightforward. <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/737818/">Munich faced a lot of push-back in some areas</a>, and the <a href="https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/politica/colau-gasta-4-5-millones-en-microsoft-mientras-promete-software-libre_32165_102.html">city of Barcelona still pays almost 5 million
euros</a>
in license costs to Microsoft.</p>

<p>The main issue here is not so much the direct cost to the city itself
(which is substantial, but not critical compared to other costs -
especially since any migration will incur a significant short-term
cost), but more that the cost must be paid over and over again by all
users separately. Barcelona continues to pay millions to Microsoft every
year, but so will other cities in Spain and across Europe, and then so will all
users of those services that may have to use a copy of Microsoft Office for
compatibility reasons (i.e. students and small businesses).</p>

<p>The same cost is paid over and over again to a foreign company that will
not hire local developers or invest in the local economy, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft#Vendor_lock-in">uses vendor lock-in</a>
to eventually control all of the critical infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-foss">Benefits of FOSS</h2>

<p>The most commonly cited benefit of Free Software is certainly the cost
savings vs. proprietary licensing. Whilst this can be a benefit
in some circumstances, I think it overlooks many greater far-reaching
benefits, and may not actually manifest itself in the short-term due to
the additional costs of the actual migration (i.e. costs of deployment
and training).</p>

<h3 id="shared-investment">Shared investment</h3>

<p>The main benefit of using FOSS solutions is that any investment in the
development and improvement of the software also benefits all other
users of the software.</p>

<p>That is, whilst the city of Munich might need <a href="https://github.com/WollMux/WollMux">some improvements in
handling templates</a>, other cities
might need other improvements - however they can all benefit from
each others’ investment, with no need to pay again just to keep a license.</p>

<p>This helps to build up a commonwealth of high-quality, well-maintained
software which anyone can use. There is no central, unique
owner of the projects (any project could be forked if necessary), so
there is no company that can demand payments just to allow you to keep using the
existing software.</p>

<p>Any investment in development made is truly an investment, leading directly
to project improvements, rather than just money sent to a foreign
company whilst the customers have no ownership of the actual product,
allowing the company to charge even more in the future just for the
right to keep using it (usually this is done by giving discounts for the
early migration which then result in higher prices later once the
customer is locked in).</p>

<p>Note that this initial investment might be higher than the current costs
of existing proprietary software licensing, when considering the
migration and training costs and possible development costs. However,
unlike those licensing costs it is a one-time cost, and the customer
retains some ownership over the resulting product (i.e. there is not a
license that can be revoked).</p>

<h3 id="freedom-for-development">Freedom for development</h3>

<p>There is also more freedom in the development process. The fact that the
products aren’t owned by a company means that contributions can be made
by anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Users of the software (such as the cities mentioned above) could fund
<a href="https://github.com/hng/tech-coops">local co-operatives of developers</a> to add desired features and maintain
the projects, instead of being forced to fund a foreign corporation with
no local investment.</p>

<p>In the long-term this might also help to break up some of the monopolistic
Big Tech companies, and result in a freer society and business
environment for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="national-security">National security</h3>

<p>In Europe especially, the current dependence on proprietary software
often means a dependence on foreign corporations which operate in
co-operation with their country’s intelligence service. As revealed by
Edward Snowden, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data">Microsoft provided backdoor access to encrypted messages</a> to
the NSA, CIA and FBI as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM programme</a>.</p>

<p>It is indefensible that such a company can run the critical infrastructure
of the vast majority of local and central government administrations, as
well as personal computers. Especially when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/08/nsa-tapped-german-chancellery-decades-wikileaks-claims-merkel">NSA has been proven to
intercept communications of supposedly allied nations</a>.</p>

<p>With FOSS software there is no central company to be pressured by
intelligence services or build in backdoors. All of the code can be
scrutinised by developers and users. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus’s Law</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same concept applies to introducing backdoors to access private data. It
might be possible to pressure or bribe one company to do so, but it
isn’t possible to do the same to tens of thousands of independent users and
developers.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture">Bigger picture</h2>

<p>The effects of co-ordinated FOSS adoption are much more far-reaching and
positive than solely saving the costs of current software licenses.</p>

<p>The adoption of FOSS and investment by many governments (at all levels)
would help to create a commonwealth of quality Free Software for all
citizens and government bodies to benefit from.</p>

<p>It would also allow development of these projects to be done from
anywhere, allowing users to fund local developers or co-operatives. This
would help to break up the massive, monopolistic Big Tech companies, and
could also be used as a way of bringing investment and jobs to parts of
the country/region that require it.</p>

<p>This would also be highly beneficial to developers, as they would have
more control over their own work (as they are not tied to the few
employers that own these popular products), and would also likely be
able to negotiate a larger portion of the compensation directly since
there would not be the overhead of salespeople and lawyers, etc. present in
current large software companies.</p>

<p>All Free Software users would benefit from the greater usage and
investment - GNU/Linux users could expect better hardware support for
example, as it becomes more commonplace.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h2>

<p>Whilst the benefits of adopting FOSS are clear, the cases in Munich and
Hungary show that it will not be an easy path to greater adoption. We
cannot just rely on central government eventually carry out the adoption
as the few representatives are easily pressured by the beneficiaries of
the status quo, and are serving a much larger political platform.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think the solution lies in applying “Linus’s Law” to
politics itself. It is no coincidence that the successes in FOSS
adoption so far have been concentrated in local government - in specific
city councils and regional administrations, because it is easier for
engaged groups of citizens to have a direct effect in local government.</p>

<p>At a national level, it might be possible for a large software company
to pressure a few political leaders and policy makers, however, it is
much harder to do the same to a whole board of a dozen or more local
councillors (especially across the multitude of different counties and
regional administrations). There is “safety in numbers” as it becomes
unfeasible to pressure and manipulate large groups of
politically-engaged citizens.</p>

<p>It it is the responsibility of every citizen in a democratic society not
only to inform themselves and vote in national elections, but also to really partake in the
political system: by joining a political party, taking part in local and
regional elections, and ensuring that the democratic standards are
upheld both inside the party and in political institutions.</p>

<p>This should have support from across the political spectrum, as
guaranteeing the security and privacy of citizens’ data whilst also
cutting out the middlemen of massive foreign corporations, shouldn’t be
a controversial policy.</p>

<p>Efforts in local politics have already proven successful, such as the
LiMux project and others mentioned previously. So if you agree with the
points raised here I hope you will join whichever local political party
you agree most with, and help to bring about FOSS adoption by your
government.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Greater FOSS adoption by our governments benefits the administrations
themselves by being free …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>There is a common view that extracting text from a PDF document should not be too difficult. After all, the text is right there in front of our eyes and humans consume PDF content all the time with great success. Why would it be difficult to automatically extract the text data? </p><p>Turns out, much how <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">working with human names is difficult</a> due to numerous edge cases and incorrect assumptions, working with PDFs is difficult due to the extreme flexibility given by the PDF format.</p><p>The main problem is that PDF was never really designed as a data input format, but rather, it was designed as an output format giving fine grained control over the resulting document.</p><p>At its core, the PDF format consists of a stream of instructions describing how to draw on a page. In particular, text data isn’t stored as paragraphs - or even words - but as characters which are painted at certain locations on the page. As a result, most of the content semantics are lost when a text or word document is converted to PDF - all the implied text structure is converted into an almost amorphous soup of characters floating on pages.</p><p>As part of building <a href="https://www.filingdb.com/">FilingDB</a>, we’ve extracted text data from tens of thousands of PDF documents. In the process, we have seen how every single assumption we had about how PDF files are structured was proven incorrect. Our mission was particularly difficult as we had to process PDF documents coming from a variety of sources, with wildly different styling, typesetting and presentation choices.</p><p>The list below documents some of the ways PDF files have made it difficult (or even impossible) to extract text contents.</p><h2>PDF read protection</h2><p>You may have come across PDF files which refuse to let you copy their text content. For example, here is what SumatraPDF shows when attempting to copy text from a copy-protected document.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tCFgGsFAVfhZQqJx.png" alt="copy denied.png"></p><p>Interestingly, the text is already visible, yet the PDF viewer is refusing to populate the clipboard with the highlighted text.</p><p>The way this is implemented is by having several “access permissions” flags, one of which controls whether copying content is allowed. It’s important to keep in mind that this restriction is not enforced by the PDF file - the actual PDF contents are unaffected and it is up to the pdf renderer to honour this flag.</p><p>Needless to say, this offers no real protection against extracting the text out of the PDF, as any reasonably sophisticated PDF handling library will allow the user to either toggle the flags or ignore them.</p><h2>Off-page characters</h2><p>It is not uncommon for PDF files to contain more textual data than is actually displayed on the page. Take this page from the 2010 Nestle annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/rWwxfWHHBcjvZQul.png" alt="Nestle hidden text.png"></p><p>There is more text associated with this page than meets the eye. In particular, the following can be found in the content data associated with this page:</p><blockquote>“KitKat celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010 but remains young and in touch with trends, having over 2.5 million Facebook fans. It is sold in over 70 countries and enjoys good growth in the developed world and emerging markets, such as the Middle East, India and Russia. Japan is its second biggest market.”</blockquote><p>This text is actually positioned outside the page’s bounding box, so it is not displayed by most PDF viewers, but the data is there and will appear when programmatically extracting the text.</p><p>This occasionally happens due to last minute decisions to remove or replace text during the type setting process.</p><h2>Small / invisible characters on page</h2><p>PDFs occasionally introduce very small or hidden text on the page. For example, here is a page from the Nestle 2012 annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/kqduhxcugDRKTbDC.png" alt="hidden characters.png"></p><p>The page contains small white text on white background with the following contents:</p><blockquote>​“Wyeth Nutrition logo Identity Guidance to markets</blockquote><blockquote>Vevey Octobre 2012 RCC/CI&amp;D”</blockquote><p>This is sometimes done for the benefit of accessibility, similar to how the alt attribute is used in HTML.</p><h2>​Too many spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs include extra spaces between letters in a word. This is most likely done for kerning purposes. (“Kerning” is the process of adjusting distances between characters during the type setting process)</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: the 2013 Hikma Pharma annual report contains the following text:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LNAUhbShXUkPbOhc.png" alt="an_excellent.PNG"></p><p>Copying the text gives:</p><blockquote>“ch a i r m a n ' s s tat em en t”</blockquote><p>Reconstructing the original text is a difficult problem to solve generally. Our most successful approach has been applying OCR techniques.</p><h2>Not enough spaces</h2><p>Sometimes PDFs do not contain spaces or replace them with a different character.</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: The following extract from the 2017 SEB annual report.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/byRVQrWFscgwqUbM.png" alt="global trends.PNG"></p><p>The extracted text shows:</p><blockquote>“Tenyearsafterthefinancialcrisisstarted”</blockquote><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: The 2013 Eurobank annual report shows the following</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/cNjRRWVALUGfSnRl.png" alt="eurobank.PNG"></p><p>Extracting the text gives:</p><blockquote>“On_April_7,_2013,_the_competent_authorities”</blockquote><p>Again, our most successful solution was to run OCR on these pages.</p><h2>Embedded fonts</h2><p>PDF font handling is complex to say the least. To understand how PDF files store text data we must first know about glyphs, glyph names, fonts.</p><ul><li>A glyph is a set of instructions describing how to draw a symbol or character.</li><li>A glyph name is the name associated with that glyph. For example “trademark” for the “™” glyph and “a” for the “a” glyph.</li><li>Fonts are lists of glyphs with associated glyph names. For example, most fonts have a glyph that most humans would recognize as the letter “a”, with different fonts showing various ways of drawing that letter.</li></ul><p>In a PDF, the characters are stored as numbers, called “codepoints”. To decide what to draw on the screen, a renderer has to go:</p><p><code>codepoint -&gt; glyph name -&gt; glyph</code></p><p>For example, a PDF document can contain codepoint 116, which it maps into the glyph name “<code>t</code>” which, in turn, maps into the glyph describing how to draw “<code>t</code>” on the screen.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/boPNiRoKrNIlOHHD.png" alt="unicode glyphs.png"></p><p>Now, most PDF files use a standard codepoint encoding. A codepoint encoding is a set of rules that assign meaning to the codepoints themselves. For example:</p><ul><li>ASCII and Unicode both use codepoint 116 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”.</li><li>Unicode maps codepoint 9786 to “<code>white smiley face</code>”, rendered as ☺, whereas ASCII is not defined at that codepoint. </li></ul><p>However, PDF documents occasionally use their own custom encoding together with custom fonts. It might seem strange, but a document can use codepoint 1 to represent the letter “<code>t</code>”. It will map codepoint 1 into the glyph name “<code>c1</code>”, which will map into a glyph describing how to draw the letter “<code>t</code>”.</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/oLGIEmjOegjUtsiQ.png" alt="custom glyphs.png"></p><p>While for a human the end result looks the same, a machine will get confused by the codepoints it is seeing. If the codepoints do not follow a standard encoding, then it is virtually impossible to programmatically know what codepoints 1, 2 and 3 represent.</p><p>Why would a PDF document contain nonstandard fonts and encodings?</p><ul><li>One reason is to make text extraction more difficult.</li><li>Another is the use of subfonts. Most fonts contain glyphs for a very large number of codepoints and a pdf might only use a subset of these. To save space, a PDF creator can strip away all unneeded glyphs and create a compact subfont which will most likely use a non-standard encoding.</li></ul><p>One workaround is to extract the font glyphs from the document, run them through OCR software and build the map from font glyph to unicode. This then lets you translate from the font-specific encoding to the unicode encoding e.g: codepoint 1 is mapped to name “<code>c1</code>” which, based on looking at the glyph, should be a “<code>t</code>”, which is unicode codepoint 116.</p><p>The encoding map that you’ve just generated, the one going from 1 to 116, is called a ToUnicode map in the PDF standard. PDF documents can provide their own ToUnicode map, but it’s optional and many do not.</p><h2>Word and paragraph detection</h2><p>Reconstructing paragraphs and even words from the amorphous character soup of PDF files is a difficult task.</p><p>The PDF document provides a list of characters on a page and it is up to the consumer to identify words and paragraphs. Humans are naturally effective at doing this as reading is a widespread skill.</p><p>The common approach is to have a grouping or clustering algorithm which compares letter sizes, positions and alignments in order to determine what is a word/paragraph.</p><p>Naive implementations can easily have complexity larger than O(n²), resulting in long processing times on busy pages.</p><h2>Text and paragraph order</h2><p>Deciding on text and paragraph order is difficult on two levels.</p><p>First, sometimes there is no correct answer. While documents with conventional, single column typesetting have a natural order of reading, documents with more adventurous layouts are challenging. As an example, it is not clear if the following inset should appear before, after, or during the article it is placed next to:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/tdNisrVDTpYeRiVU.png" alt="paragraph order.PNG"></p><p>Second, even when the answer is clear to a human, determining robust paragraph order is a very difficult problem to solve, perhaps even AI-hard. This might sound like an extreme statement, however there are cases where the correct paragraph order can only be decided by understanding the text content.</p><p>Consider the following two-columns layout, describing how to prepare a vegetable salad:</p><p><img src="https://landen.imgix.net/blog_HFohGeonJNaiykXv/assets/LVpxBZtdQdXIYMfv.png" alt="recipe.png"></p><p>In the western world, a reasonable assumption is that reading is done left to right and top to bottom. So the best we can do without looking at the contents is to reduce the answer to 2 options: A B C D and A C B D.</p><p>By looking at the content, understanding what it is talking about and knowing that vegetables are washed before chopping, we can determine that A C B D is the correct order.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Jugaad is an attitude towards delivery which originated in India and consists of three simple tenets:</p>



<ul><li>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</li><li>Openness: keep your options open</li><li>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</li></ul>



<p>Jugaad is agility taken to the extreme and most suitable for projects with a high degree of change, risk and uncertainty. Nothing demonstrates the essence of jugaad better than the homonymous improvised vehicles built in India. All essential mechanical parts lay open and are easily accessible instead of being enclosed in casings. The vehicle can be assembled from commonly available, repurposed parts. It can be customised and extended to fit a variety of personal and professional needs, workloads and environments. The choice of parts can adapt the jugaad vehicle to different types of terrain, usage, fuel and availability of parts.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>



<p>This post is not the result of studying literature, most of which seems to have been written around the peek of the jugaad hype in 2010. It rather distils the experience of a decade working with delivery teams in India, what I learned from their approach to delivery and from being immersed in Indian corporate culture. Through large parts of this post it may seem that I advocate the adoption of jugaad and the abolition of other agile methods; the opposite is true – I will try to make the point that the wholistic approach of jugaad to solution design should be paired with the tactical discipline of a framework like agile or XP.</p>



<h2>The tenets work together</h2>



<p>The three tenets (Humility, Openness, Frugality) complement and contradict each other in a beautiful way: Humility <em>generates</em> options for a solution, openness <em>guides</em> and <em>combines</em> them and frugality <em>eliminates</em> them. Only solutions adhering to all three tenets are built in the jugaad spirit.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1741" data-permalink="https://blog.georgovassilis.com/options/" data-orig-file="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png" data-orig-size="607,165" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="options" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=607" src="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=607" alt="" srcset="https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png 607w, https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=150 150w, https://georgovassilis.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/options.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"><figcaption>Tenets refine options</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Humility: use whatever works without prejudice</h2>



<p>Delivery methods like Waterfall, Scrum and XP wage religious wars over definitions (eg. what is the right sprint length?), processes (eg. degree of upfront planning), skills (eg. which framework should we use) and tools (eg. Maven or Gradle) all of which are more or less derivatives of adherence to a method. Jugaad replaces those definitions, processes, skills and tools with a central guidance: <em>be conscious about the shortcuts taken</em> with respect to the two other tenets. Jugaad frequently comes with a high degree of “out of the box” thinking and requires, for it to work, the humility to let go of technical and methodological preconceptions about what is the “appropriate” way and focus solely on the result.</p>



<p>Humility is the starting point in jugaad in that using “whatever works” generates a plethora of options. So how do we choose amongst these options? That is where Openness takes over.</p>



<h2>Openness: keep your options open</h2>



<p>The ostensible carelessness with which jugaad approaches delivery is built on the solid foundation of Openness. Whatever we build should be easy to extend, change or reverse. Openness often lacks elegance and conciseness, the inner workings of things are exposed, there is not much polish and one can see the parts a solution is made of – not to mention the security concerns arising from such solution. Just think of the jugaad vehicle we talked about earlier if you need a mental picture. But those trade-offs enable easily modifiable solutions and are exactly that: conscious trade-offs, not shortcomings. A solution which is open to change is a solid project or product foundation as it can adapt to unforeseen changes and doesn’t require much up-front design. Openness takes Humility’s options and guides them into coherent patterns. Not all options will form a good solution and not all combinations of options will work; Openness tells us which of them <em>might</em> work without losing an arm and a leg in the process of finding out.</p>



<h2>Frugality: small expenses keep regrets small</h2>



<p>Frugality is about risk management: reducing upfront costs <em>now </em>allows exploring more value propositions and solution approaches <em>now</em> while spending resources <em>later</em> on improving the solution. A low cost incurred early jeopardises a project less than a large cost incurred at the same time, especially if whatever that cost bought us turned out to be the wrong thing. Frugality is a holistic view on the patterns guided by Openness – it takes into consideration synergies between options and maximises value, both in terms of business value created for the solution (how many of the requirements were implemented at what effort) as well as value added to the project delivery (how much delivery and quality was improved, what was learned etc).</p>



<h2>Comparison by example</h2>



<p>Jugaad is illustrated best with a couple of examples which contrast traditional, “proper” design with improvised jugaad design.</p>



<h3>Example: receipt system</h3>



<p>Design a system that generates, stores and sends receipts via email to customers. Customer support should be able to retrieve receipts.</p>



<p>The traditional, “proper” solution:  we program a system that stores receipts in a relational database, generates receipt PDFs, stores those PDFs in the database, sends the PDFs to customers. We program a web interface for use by customer service which can query the database for receipts.</p>

<p>The jugaad-engineered solution: we program a system that generates HTML receipts, emails them to customers and BCCs a customer support email account with the same receipt. Customer support can use their email client to retrieve receipts. These components are either packaged and require no development effort (Customer support E-Mail client, E-Mail server), there a only few components and they are easy to implement.</p>

<p>Let’s evaluate the jugaad-engineered solution against jugaad’s tenets and compare it with the “traditional” solution.</p>



<p>Humility: the design relies on packaged components which probably already exist and it only minimally invades the existing IT landscape. It reuses high quality packaged solutions (e-mail server, e-mail client) which may already exist in the organisation and reduces implementation tasks to e-mail server and e-mail client configurations. The traditional delivery method places several requirements on how the solution is built: it mandates formal APIs, probably a particular technology platform, a pre-defined method according to which components are structured (eg. SOLID), technical documentation and thorough test automation long before it is clear that the project will make it into production, but nevertheless increasing conceptional and real complexity of the solution and the delivery process and requiring an increased skill set for project participants. </p>



<p>Openness: the e-mail protocols between the application, e-mail servers and e-mail clients are well understood and extensible. Using E-Mail clients requires low to no training and the IT department probably maintains them already. The components themselves can be substituted without affecting much the rest of the solution; eg. a new field can be added to future receipts without modifying already issued receipts. Because many components can be operated by human agents (the e-mail server and e-mail clients), many new features and workarounds can be implemented as manual processes before coding and automating them into software. Since not much effort has been put at the initial stage into upfront design there isn’t much effort wasted when requirements change and implementations follow.</p>



<p>Frugality: the use of packaged components, especially when they are already familiar, reduces implementation effort and speeds up delivery at the cost of the finished product showing incongruities where different components interface.  New requirements needing larger changes can be implemented by exchanging existing components for components better fitting the requirements or even rewriting them from scratch, if needed. In many cases the early progress made thanks to the low initial effort should more than make up for the higher, later cost. The traditional solution contrasts badly with jugaad in terms of effort. For example, it will mandate a particular API design such as a REST API for the receipt generator and receipt retrieval or even a REST API between the receipt generator and the email server, because… principles. Technical documentation will be written for the components long before it is clear that the project will ever go live, not considering that any effort spent on non-value adding features jeopardises a go-live. And last not least unit tests will be written to achieve an arbitrarily agreed upon test coverage before it is clear that they generate business value eg. by catching regressions. The jugaad-engineered solution will produce formal APIs, documentation and test automation when their added value outweighs the implementation effort.</p>



<h2>Contrast with agile</h2>



<p>Jugaad has no processes like Scrum or XP. It talks about the values worth striving for. It doesn’t talk about velocity or quality; even the focus on low cost introduces the discipline to achieving openness, thus being able to revisit a previously built solution. Agile highlights <em>reactiveness</em>, it’s main point being the ability to react to unforeseen changes, but it uses a predefined process such as Scrum or Kanban. The process must adapt to organisational changes or changing skill sets. Jugaad does not dictate any delivery process, so in a way it is orthogonal to existing agile practices. By adding formalised steps to it, a mature jugaad practice may evolve into Scrum or Kanban if that seems useful.</p>



<p>But jugaad is not about agile without …</p></div></div>

How Sisyphean it is, the prospect of searching interminably for new solutions to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140801022058/http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordination problems</a>! I lament that positive-sum possibilities can barely be glimpsed through a tangle of innumerable constraints.</p><p>The fact is... it's true. There is tremendous suffering, beyond my ability to convey and beyond the auspices of the word "fix." Nothing can be said, no conclusion can be reached, that will negate that. It is what it is.</p><p>Reality does not have a human value system. The most you can say about the association between the two is that human value systems are figments within reality, gesturing at its structure. Sometimes the gesture is 🙏, sometimes it's 🖕, and everything in between.</p>

Likewise, I would still grieve.</p><p>For unnameable reasons I find it therapeutic to examine the facets of pain closely, specifically, and in depth. I want to know how bad it can be.

We're talking very seriously awful, so click with caution.) These days I scarcely have the stomach for extended revelry in prurient gore, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_120_Days_of_Sodom">de Sade's work</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogg_(novel)">Samuel Delany's <em>Hogg</em></a>.

                      <p>After his dugout suffers a direct hit from a German shell in the last days of the Great War, 20-year-old American infantryman Joe Bonham gradually comes to in a French hospital. As his thoughts become more lucid, he realises he has been left deaf, dumb and blind and that all four of his limbs have subsequently been amputated. His face, meanwhile, has been obliterated by the shell and what is left — "a red gash ... with mucus hanging from it" — is now covered by a mask to avoid distressing the nurses.</p>
<p>Despite his injuries, his mind still functions as well as ever, letting him think back to his childhood in small-town Colorado and allowing him to contemplate the full horror of his situation.

<p>I am not one to cry from reading, but I imagine many a reader would when reading of the despair of life with a young family during a famine and of what they witness. There is much more emotional engagement elsewhere in the story, whether it is the despair of poverty; the frustration of the inequities between rich and poor, men and women, workers and freeloaders; the fear of violence and disappointment in the character's choices. [...]</p>
<p>Wang has known nothing other than the hardworking, precarious, life of a peasant. The life within the House of Hwang is as alien to him as the life of a Westerner. He does not consider how different his life might have been if he had been born into privilege. Nor does he realise, since upward financial and social mobility is his dream, how, if he were to succeed, it would change the way he feels about his wife, the way he would raise his sons or the life he would choose to lead. The thought that his sons might grow up in a completely different environment to himself, with personalities, opportunities, ambitions and wants completely foreign to his own would baffle him.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We live in an incredible time in human history where the basic infrastructure for many of us is so good.</p><p>In today’s world it is possible to get ahead and achieve a lot all by yourself. You can be a writer with 1mn readers, a social media star with 1mn followers, or a SaaS business with $1mn in ARR.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the mindset Sankalp and I both embodied when we first started on our journey. We had faith that just the 2 of us working together towards our shared goal is enough to get us really far.</p><p>Thankfully that faith turned into reality and lead to the success of SuperLemon.</p><h3>Challenging our beliefs</h3><p>But any great mindset or philosophy is only as great as the people who practice it, and people are always evolving and getting better. Mindset and philosophy evolves too.</p><p>The people in our lives who believed in us and wanted us to do even better challenged us on our beliefs of doing things amongst just the 2 of us.</p><p>One of them said - we are setting small goals, because we are afraid of hiring. If we had the confidence that we can put together a great team, we would think bigger and set higher goals.</p><p>We knew in our hearts that the challenge was genuine. Due to our poor experiences with hiring in the past, we started favouring the path of least resistance, which is to not try to hire anyone. Automatically our goals would only be as lofty as how much the two of us can achieve together. </p><p>We had to change this about ourselves. And so we immediately set out to <a href="https://twitter.com/hipreetam93/status/1296089975818055680" target="_blank">hire someone amazing</a> into our team. It was an exercise to prove to ourselves that we have what it takes to do this.</p><h3>An updated mindset</h3><p>Less than a month later, we hired an amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/akashjdotcom" target="_blank">first engineer</a> and have made an offer to another. This exercise has turned out way better than we anticipated, and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It allowed us to dream bigger.</p><p>Our mindset and philosophy has thus been updated - We can get far in today’s world just by ourselves, but if we want to get really really far with our next venture <a href="https://delight.chat/" target="_blank">Delight.chat</a>, we need more than just the two of us.&nbsp;</p><p>While we suddenly haven't started wanting to build a 400 person company, our mindset has evolved enough to accept and understand how building a team of 5-15 people could produce a 100x result of what we had previously set out to achieve.</p><h3>People on the inside</h3><p>We need people on the inside (a team) who are aligned with our shared vision, and working together using their mind and abilities towards achieving that goal. </p><p>It's not just having more hands in the engineering team in building the product, or marketing team in creating content or distribution channels.</p><p>Their consciousness, ideas, problem solving abilities, attitude and values get added into a collective pool with our own. The sum is greater than the parts.</p><p>The people joining our team are entrepreneurial minds whose values align with ours, who want to build and grow something new and challenging from the ground up, learn from the experience, and eventually start their own companies. We will be their first supporters when they do. Psst, <a href="https://www.notion.so/Join-our-tribe-at-Delight-chat-dfb896c946a843ebb58bbb1cc161fe33#dfa80f89af17410e9076d1d4fbfcff35" target="_blank">we are hiring</a>.</p><h3>People on the outside</h3><p>We need people on the outside (advisors, investors) who are aligned with our end goal of building a great company, and are going out of their way in helping us get there. </p><p>They align with our mindset of building a real business that thrives without burning $1 for 70 cents,&nbsp;delivers real value to end users, and grows to a reasonably large size while being profitable.</p><p>Their experience observing other entrepreneurs and companies will help us avoid common pitfalls, make better connections like key hires, and open up doors that we can't even imagine today, because we don't know those doors exist. Serendipity.</p><h3>Onwards</h3><p>I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that we have a handful of such people who believe in us, and who are now working with us towards achieving our shared goal.</p><p>Together, we will reach farther than we previously dared to imagine.</p><p>Off we go towards the next milestone in this great adventure.</p></div></div>]]>

  <article>
    <p>I use <a href="https://goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> a lot because I like to read books and want to find more books to read. This morning I was reading a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24451428">thread on hackernews</a> on <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/08/better-goodreads-possible-bad-for-books-storygraph-amazon">Sarah Manavis’s NewStatesman article</a> and it reminds me of how much I want, I yearn, for useful book recommendations. I think about this pretty much every time I open the goodreads page or app and hope that maybe this is the day they finally fix recommendations, so I figure I would capture some ideas I have for fixing their recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="i-love-goodreads">I Love Goodreads</h2>

<p>First, I love Goodreads. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9499790-brian">profile</a> says I joined May 2012. But I think that’s just whenever I started this profile and I have multiple, old profiles that I can’t find. My memory says I started using them soon after launch, but maybe I’m misremembering. But I’ve used them for a long time because I like to read books. I love browsing bookstores and libraries looking for new books. I experience joy finding a 50 or 100 year old book that I didn’t know about. One of my favorite things is reading a book so good that I can’t go to bed, or want to walk an extra mile. But that’s pretty rare for me, I’m lucky if I get one of those a year.</p>

<p>I have goodreads on my <a href="http://prepend.com/stack.xml">link stack</a> with the tag <a href="https://www.prepend.com/future/technology/2020/01/purdah.html">“purdah”</a> that I think means it is part of the stuff I do that uniquely identifies me.</p>

<p>Any time I get a recommendation from a friend or article or wherever, I add it to my “to read” shelf on goodreads. That helps me when I’m trying to buy a new book. So at least I can read through the 245 books that at least a past me wanted to read. This works well and is better than a vanilla list.</p>

<p>I also like seeing what my friends read and especially what they like or dislike. My friends have different tastes so it’s not as simple as just reading everything they read, but it helps a little. It’s one of the few places that I think facebook helps because at least I get to find out facebook friends who also are on goodreads. Every once in a while I find a new book through this feed, maybe once every 2 years. This might be because I don’t have many friends on goodreads (only 42), but I think it’s also because different people have different tastes in books.</p>

<p>I also like that goodreads will tell me when an author I’ve read releases a new book, or is having a book chat or something. Although I wish they would tell me when they come to a local book signing.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-as-i-see-it">The Problem As I See It</h2>

<p>This gets me to what I think is wrong and want to fix. I have read and rated 802 books with my average rating of 3.97. This makes sense as I’m probably only going to read books I think I’ll like, but I think this is the average goodreads rating, not the average of my ratings. Looking at what I rated, I’ve only given out 3 one stars, 42 two stars and tons of five stars. I keep scrolling on and on.</p>

<p>The user interface for goodreads is pretty bad- information is hard to find, layout is wasted, search doesn’t work well, hard to tell ads from user content- but that’s not what I’m talking about here. The main problem is in finding books that I will like. Maybe a UX overhaul from a great designer would help, but not that much. A craigslist interface would be great if they could just solve this one problem…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is the single book that I will love most in all the world?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to find the next amazing experience. Books are great because they are cheap and portable. It’s not like wine where the best is more than I’ll ever pay. Or travel where a first class flight can cost $20k. If I can find a book, I can read it. And maybe someone I know can read it too.</p>

<p>If I can mix in more wonderful books, my life will be better. My family’s life will be better. Etc etc. Maybe this is the answer to world enlightenment. Probably not, but it will be great, I think.</p>

<p>When I click on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/recommendations">recommendations</a>, goodreads shows me five books that I don’t want to read. And it’s weirdly bad. Some of it makes since why it’s bad. They recommend different versions of books I’ve read. They recommend two different versions of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (one of my favorite books), but I guess they don’t know these are the same book. That’s just a waste of time and it’s weird that amazon isn’t smart enough to avoid duplicative books.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/goodreads_recommendations.png" alt="Screenshot of goodreads recommendations page"></p>

<p>But then they recommend stuff like Stephen King’s <em>The Long Walk</em>. This is perplexing because I only have one book that goodreads knows I’ve read from King and I rated it two stars. I don’t have any of his books in my “to read” list. Why would they recommend this book? Two of my friends rated it four stars and one even wrote a recommendation. So maybe that’s why. I’m aware of this book and don’t want to read it. But other books like <em>Shoe Dog</em> by Phil Knight has no relationship to me. Why would they recommend this? I also know about this book and don’t want to read it. I wish there was some way to note books that I don’t want to read. Then at least they would stop showing me the same book over and over.</p>

<p>So it seems like goodreads is making pretty basic, rules-based recommendations. And they don’t help me pick new books.</p>

<h2 id="my-perfect-wish">My Perfect Wish</h2>

<p>My idea for an 11-star experience <sup id="fnref:brian_chesky" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:brian_chesky">1</a></sup> in finding new books is that Goodreads knows me even better than I know myself and constantly recommends the perfect book. They recommend books that teach me, that spark enlightenment, that I hate but teach me to appreciate other books, books for when I want to be happy, and books for when I need to be sad. I want something like Jane from Ender’s Game who experiences everything I know but is fixated on finding me a good book. So the output of a book sommelier whose passion is seeing me sit there and love a book.</p>

<p>That’s what I would like.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-story-about-jeff-bezos">A Little Story About Jeff Bezos</h2>

<p>Once I was lucky enough to go to TED. It was great on so many levels, I highly recommend it and 2/3 of the cost was tax deductible. It was full of great stuff. I got to wait in the registration line in front of Neil Gaiman and Amanda Palmer, that was neat.</p>

<p>Anyway, one night Neil Gaiman was doing in a midnight ghost story reading in some neat four story townhouse type building <sup id="fnref:vancouver_club" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vancouver_club">2</a></sup> that was totally empty and spooky and a great place for the event. The reading was on the top floor and there was a huge crowd waiting for the single elevator in this place. The lights were off and there weren’t any staff around so it was maybe 100 people waiting to go up three at a time. So I looked around the corner and took the stairs. About 2 or 3 other people had the same idea so we started racing up the stairs to get to the top and avoid the crowds.</p>

<p><img src="http://prepend.com/assets/images/vancouver_club.jpg" alt="Vancouver Club street view">
<em>photo by <a href="https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/2-joe-fox">Joe Fox</a></em></p>

<p>This building was awesome. It seemed 100 years old, rare in Vancouver, and as we went up the stairs we saw each floor. The stairwell opened up to a big room that could probably seat a 50 person wedding dinner. The lights were off, and someone had opened a few windows and the white, wispy curtains were blowing with a little breeze. Even though it didn’t feel like a breeze. I said “cool, haunted house” and stopped climbing the stairs to look around. The person next to me said “yeah, cool” and we started quickly running around checking out the empty room. We did this on the third floor too and me and this random person did quick 60 second explorations of this spooky house.</p>

<p>It all happened quickly. Maybe 3 minutes to go up the stairs, run around each floor, and get to the top. About halfway through I realized this random dude was Jeff Bezos. I thought that was neat. I’ve bought books from Amazon since 1995 and I’m pretty sure I telnetted into it to order some books (although maybe that was cdnow before they bought them), so it was cool to think that Jeff Bezos likes haunted houses and still likes exploring empty buildings.</p>

<p>We got to the top and went into the venue and were maybe the first 10 people. Comically got there maybe after two or three elevators full of people. We went to the front where Gaiman was setting up at the podium. I got a comfy chair right in the front about five feet in front of Gaiman. Jeff Bezos sat in the chair to my left. The chair on my right had Neil’s wife, Amanda Palmer, who was carrying a ukelele case. I didn’t know it was a ukulele case until she told me. She also said she might play, but she didn’t.</p>

<p>Gaiman finished setting up and came up to talk to Bezos. Bezos asked if Gaiman got the books he sent. Gaiman said he did and they were really great and he enjoyed reading them. It seemed like this was the most recent in a series of book shipments.</p>

<p>Aside from nerd joy from getting to witness this small talk of people who interest me, I thought, at the time and many times since,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How cool is it that Neil-freaking Gaiman is still finding new books that are great, and how cool would it be to get book recommendations from Jeff Bezos. I bet he has access to the best book recommendations in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, TED has something called the “TED book club” where they mail you this box of books a month before the conference. This was the closest I’ve come to my dream. They maybe sent 10 and 5 are still on my bookshelf. But not the shelf behind me, so I don’t remember them specifically. I’ll look them up one day.</p>

<p>That’s probably better than Jane making recommendations. Amazon had just bought goodreads a year earlier and I was hopeful that any day, goodreads would roll out a wonderful recommendation engine any day now.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-do-to-fix">What I Want to Do to Fix</h2>

<p>What I would like to do is to just get a data dump of mine and everyone on goodreads recommendations. I don’t need to know the identities, just to know what recommendations go with what individual. It would be neat to protect privacy and find individuals to potentially follow them on goodreads, but I think for the analysis I want to do, I don’t need to know the actual identities.</p>

<p>I think if I have this data, I could try to find people who rate a few hundred books like I have, then look at what books they’ve read the most, or books that they’ve rated highest. I think that would be a good signal that I might like it.</p>

<p>It would also be cool to see …</p></article></div></div>

<li>*fixes in Getting Rid of Exceptions snippet 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was introduced to Rust in 2018 and has been enamored since. Rust is a system programming language, much like C++. Unlike C++ though, being relatively new, its language design is more modern and sophisticated. Writing with can feel more like writing TypeScript or Haskell. Not surprising since, despite being a language with a very minimum runtime and no GC, it derives many principles of functional programming such as immutability, type inference, higher-order functions, pattern-matching, etc. Over the course of tinkering things with Rust, I realized that writing Rust code makes me a better coder in other languages. This article will describe how my attempt to push the best in Rust's language design into TypeScript, my main language, without altering the language itself.</p>
<h2>Getting Rid of Exceptions</h2>
<p>The first thing that strikes me the first time I learnt Rust is that there are no straightforward to write exception-like code in Rust. For someone used to exceptions after using many languages like C++, Java, JavaScript and TypeScript, this seems like an incomplete language. But Rust's lack of straightforward exception-like is actually thought out in advance.</p>
<p>Exceptions feel neat the first time you understand it. A thrown exception skips code execution into the <code>catch</code> block. By doing that you can ignore the rest of code in the function. The rest of the code in the function represents positive case, which may seem irrelevant when an error happens. Here's a piece of code:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span> </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>"Error: foo"</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>}
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>someNumber</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;
}
</span><span>baz</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>When <code>baz</code> is called it will throw an uncaught exception. By reading the code you know that <code>foo</code> throws an Error. Debugging this snippet is a piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Now let's see another snippet. In the snippet below you are importing a function that can throw exception.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>callMe</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"somePackage"</span><span>;

</span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>callMe</span><span>();
}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>exception</span><span>.</span><span>message</span><span>);
}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Compared to the first snippet, this one is harder to debug. It seems so because 1.) You don't know that <code>callMe</code> will throw an error or not. 2.) If it throws an exception you will not know what is the type of the exception. The more modular your code is, the harder it is to debug exceptions.</p>
<p>Why is that? If you noticed, in the first snippet, you know which function is throwing what because the <code>throw</code> and the caller are in one file. You don't need to switch files or even scroll that far to see what's wrong. Furthermore, unlike in other language like java, TypeScript exceptions are not typed. Because of that, unlike return values, the compiler could not deduce if a function will throw an exception or not, and that's bad. Combined with the fact that an exception propagates up until they are caught. That means exception can be n-level deep. The deeper it is from, the harder it is to debug it.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with statically-typed language, deferring what's supposed to be done in compile-time to run-time is bad. It hands over problems from the compiler to the user.</p>
<p>There are best practices for writing <code>try/throw/catch</code>, such as developers should throw <code>Error</code> objects instead of nullish values. But pushing everyone to apply best practice is not enough. You cannot assert control toward what is being written in external dependencies. There are not many points introducing law when enforcers are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Only when you have dealt with complex codebase you will understand why <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontUseExceptionsForFlowControl">we should not use exception for flow control</a>.</p>
<p>So how Rust does this? Rust encourages us to return errors instead of throwing it by providing a data type called <code>Result</code>. It is a tagged union which can either be <code>Ok(IdealData)</code> or <code>Err(NonIdealData)</code>. With this, a function can communicate the situation of a a call to its caller. For example:</p>

    <div data-language="rust">
      <pre><code><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span> () {</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"1"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>non_number</span><span>: </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>number</span><span>);      </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>, &amp;</span><span>non_number</span><span>);  </span><span>
</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>The function <code>.parse()</code> converts a <code>string</code> into <code>u8</code>. There are scenarios where parsing a <code>string</code> into a <code>u8</code> can result in failure, one is if the parsed string is not a numeric string. Because <code>.parse()</code> has a negative case, it returns <code>Result&lt;u8, _&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In Rust, <code>Err</code> does not jump like exceptions. Regardless the result is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>, the program will simply execute the next line. To handle the error the programmer has to check the return value is <code>Ok</code> or <code>Err</code>. Early return is encouraged instead of throw. Rust has the <code>?</code> syntax which help making early returns more concise to write and read.</p>
<p>To adopt this feature to TypeScript, these are the important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Errors are returned instead of thrown</li>
<li>Errors types are known</li>
</ol>
<p>To simulate this behavior I am going to use tagged union too. I found this helpful library, <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">fp-ts</a>. It covers a great deal of functional programming experience by leveraging TypeScript's type system, but I will only use a small portion of it.</p>
<p><code>fp-ts</code> has <code>Either&lt;Left, Right&gt;</code> data type. It is like Rust's <code>Result</code> but more flexible. <code>Either</code> is a tagged union value container. <code>Either</code> is <code>Left</code> or <code>Right</code>, usually <code>Right</code> represents the ideal case and <code>Left</code> represents the non-ideal case but both can be used with any types. Below is the type definition of <code>Either</code>.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Left</span><span>&lt;</span><span>L</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"left"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>L</span><span> </span><span>};
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Right</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>_tag</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"right"</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>What's cool about <code>Either</code> is that TypeScript actually supports deducing tagged union from its tag. For example inside this block <code>if (someEither._tag === "left") { }</code> TypeScript knows that <code>someEither</code> is a <code>Left</code>. If there's a <code>return</code> in that block, TypeScript will deduce that for the rest of the function block, <code>someEither</code> data type is <code>Right</code> and not <code>Either</code> anymore.</p>
<p>Let's make a called <code>tryCatch</code>. It is used to wrap a function into Either. <code>fp-ts</code> actually provides this function, but let's write it so that we know what's under the hood.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>tryCatch</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>onError</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unknown</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>E</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fn</span><span>());
</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>onError</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));
</span><span>  </span><span>}
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>With our newly created <code>tryCatch</code>, creating a URL from string for example can be done like this.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>tryCatch</span><span>(
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>URL</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>),
</span><span>    </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span>()
</span><span>  </span><span>);</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Calling the function will look like this. The following snippet receives a string called <code>maybeUrl</code>. If <code>maybeUrl</code> is not a valid URL it returns an error. If the URL is not calling "example.com" it returns an error. Otherwise, it returns a promise from the <code>fetch</code> call.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>callThisMaybeUrlIfItIncludesExampleDotCom</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(
</span><span>  </span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>
):</span><span> </span><span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>InvalidURLError</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Promise</span><span>&lt;</span><span>any</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>makeURLFromString</span><span>(</span><span>maybeUrl</span><span>);
</span><span>  </span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>isLeft</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>))</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>left</span><span>;

</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>url</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>urlResult</span><span>.</span><span>right</span><span>;
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>.</span><span>origin</span><span> </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>"example.com"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>left</span><span>(</span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>NotExampleDotComError</span><span>());

</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>right</span><span>(</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>urlResult</span><span>));
};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>There's a bit more line of codes here, but it is great that the TypeScript compiler now can deduce the error type and you have more control over the flow. You can even deduce if the variable <code>error</code> is <code>instanceof</code> <code>NotExampleDotComError</code> or <code>InvalidURLError</code> for cases like printing different errors.</p>
<h2>Safe TypeScript</h2>
<p>If you have played an early 2000s FPS games and tried to cheat, usually you will find the <code>noclip</code> command. It makes your avatar fly through walls and grounds. Sometimes, though, you take a shortcut and triggers the wrong script. When that happens, you can't finish your level and must restart to make it work again.</p>
<p>That's how I see Rust's <code>unsafe</code> and TypeScript's <code>any</code>.</p>
<p>These two features solve a similar problem. In Rust's case, it enables developers to temporarily unlock the power of handling raw pointer in case someone needs it. In TypeScript's case, someone might need to escape into the free-typed JavaScript world. And in both, it is the programmer's responsibility to make sure everything is fine before the program goes back to the safe system.</p>
<p>Unsafe to safe Rust is like <code>any</code> type to typed TypeScript. Unlike Rust, TypeScript's type only works until you compile it to JavaScript code. Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/conversion/try_from_try_into.html">TryInto/TryFrom</a> trait to convert raw data into a data type. But in TypeScript's case, if you inject a value that does not match TypeScript's type annotation, TypeScript can't do anything. This comes from TypeScript team's decision to make it only a thin layer on top of JavaScript. They thought it is best if for people to write TypeScript like JavaScript and the compilation result to look almost the same as the source code.</p>
<p>My approach for this would be securing all external hole of my application, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebAPIs, which consist of DOM, deserializable user inputs, fetch API, etc.</li>
<li>External Dependencies which returns <code>any</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was trying this approach, I was lucky to find <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a>, created by the same author as <code>fp-ts</code>. This library helps me create a runtime type checker, or "codec" as the library's author calls it. Instead of writing:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>};</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>I wrote the codec for User:</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>const</span><span> </span><span>UserCodec</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>({</span><span> </span><span>username</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>userId</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>});
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ioTs</span><span>.</span><span>TypeOf</span><span>&lt;</span><span>typeof</span><span> </span><span>UserCodec</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
    </div>
<p>Again, this is longer, but this is very useful if we want to secure those holes.</p>

    <div data-language="text/typescript">
      <pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>InvalidTypeError</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span> </span><span>{}
</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Fet…</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

          <p><span>In my journey learning 9 languages over the years, I tried all sorts of different methods to make my learning more effective. Here are some of the notable approaches, along with why they work (or don't work). It </span> <a href="https://knowledgeartist.org/article/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-a-language" target="_blank"><span>will be a long learning journey</span></a> <span>, I hope this article will make yours more fun and effective. </span></p> <p><span>Let's jump right in.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Moving to the Target Country</span></h3></p> <p><span>In my experience learning a language, immersion is powerful. Being in a country where your target language is spoken is ideal. Your learning becomes always on, even if you don't realize it. </span></p> <p><span>I moved to Tokyo and worked at an all-Japanese company a few years ago. At the beginning I knew very little Japanese. But with this sink-or-swim approach and the daily immersion, I became comfortable with basic conversations within three months.</span></p> <p><span>Now, it is not always possible to just pack up and move to a different place. Read on for other tips I tested from my own experience. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Language Exchange Meetups</span></h3></p> <p><span>You can only get so good at speaking a language without talking to native speakers. Language exchange groups are a great way to get that conversational practice. In a typical event, you would get paired up/grouped with native speakers of your target language, who are themselves looking to level up on your native tongue. </span></p> <p><span>For half of the time, the group would converse in one language, and then switch to the other language half-way. If you live in a major city, there are usually quite a few of these groups for the common languages. </span> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank"><span>Meetup</span></a> <span> is a great place to look for these events. This is an effective way to practice in your home city, or when you are already in your target country. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Online Language Exchange</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you are unable to attend in-person meetups, online language exchange can be effective as well. Though in-person conversations would always feel more organic, you still get the instant feedback and practice with online language exchange calls. </span></p> <p><span>I have made a few friends along the way, while practicing my German, French, and Japanese. I previously had a pleasant experience using </span> <a href="https://www.italki.com/" target="_blank"><span>iTalki</span></a> <span>, where I could easily find language partners and schedule 1-1 Skype calls with them. It was entirely free. But at the time of writing, it appears they may have removed the free partner option.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Learning Entire Phrases</span></h3></p> <p><span>I found it effective to memorize entire sentences, and pull them out when I need to. There are several benefits to this. When you are communicating in realtime, having phrases already memorized can reduce your stumbling. It can make you appear fluent and keep the conversation flowing. This also makes you feel more comfortable, knowing what to say or how to respond in a given situation.</span></p> <p><span>These familiar phrases serve as important anchors as well, for learning about the structure of the language, and for easily swapping out components to adapt to new situations. For example, after memorizing the phrase "After a few months of travelling, I am happy to finally be able to work with everyone", you can substitute some of the words and use it in a new scenario.</span></p> <p><span>Phrase books can be somewhat useful for this purpose, though it can sound scripted and unnatural. What feels more natural is writing down and remembering the response of native speaker in a real-life situation or in a movie.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Movies/Shows in Your Target Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>Movies and TV shows are a great source of natural-sounding phrases (though overly dramatic sometimes) to add to your knowledge bank. This is great for a number of reasons: </span></p> <p><li><span>You can usually figure out what the movie is about (especially if you first watch it in your native language).</span></li></p> <p><li><span>It is enjoyable, which means you will stick with it</span></li></p> <p><li><span>You get to learn about the culture behind your target language</span> <strong> </strong> <span>as well.</span></li></p> <p><span>And if you are watching it on TV, I find that even the commercials in your target language are interesting. Not only is it good practice, you get a better sense of what kinds of products local people buy and the messaging that appeals to them. With the growing selection of international shows/movies on Netflix, along with audio and/or subtitles, this is a fun and easy way to make progress.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Interviews with Subtitles and Translations</span></h3></p> <p><span>In addition to movies/shows, interviews are the perfect content for getting exposure to natural conversations, where people use casual everyday language. </span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/magauchsein" target="_blank"><span>Easy Languages</span></a> <span> on YouTube is hands down one of my favourite language resources. They interview people on the streets on a different topic each episode, and provide subtitles in the original language + English. Over the years, they have built up an amazing collection of content in many (!) languages.</span></p> <p><span>Here's a taste of their content for German learners: </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLoatpfE7VM?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Passive Background Looping</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is one of the most effective hacks I developed to maximize my time spent learning a language. As I work, I would put on a familiar track of native speakers talking (much of the time it would be Easy Languages) in the ground. This way, I can get a lot of listening practice without spending much time. By picking content that you are already familiar with, you already know what is being talked about. And the looping gets you more "reps" for each phrase. It also helps you memorize entire phrases that you can use with ease later.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Podcasts </span></h3></p> <p><span>This one can be tricky. I have tried quite a few podcasts and many podcast formats aren't that conducive to learning a foreign language. Either I don't understand what's going on, or there is too much repeating over the often dry content. But for Japanese learners, I highly recommend </span> <a href="https://bilingualnews.libsyn.com/" target="_blank"><span>Bilingual News</span></a> <span> hosted by Michael and Mami. It features the hosts talking about interesting topics in the news, with Michael speaking only English and Mami speaking only Japanese. The conversation always moves forward and remains engaging, and you can usually easily fill in the words you missed from the context. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Ask a Native Speaker "How do I say X?" Wherever Possible</span></h3></p> <p><span>If you have friends (or better yet, roommates) from other countries, you can definitely get some practice in as you hang out. When you are trying to say something, why not learn to say it in your target language too? Anytime is learning time! You'll remember it much better than other methods because the learning takes place in real-life expeirences. I used to worry this may come off as annoying, but in my experience most people are happy to help, and appreciate the ernest effort you make to understand their language/culture. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Changing Your Phone's Language</span></h3></p> <p><span>One easy way to squeeze out an extra bit of language immersion is to simply change your mobile phone to your target language. Doing so should automatically update the language in all your apps as well. Since you likely already know how to navigate through most apps anyway, in most cases you can guess the meaning of new words that you don't yet know. With this, even Facebook notifications become good practice. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Taking classes</span></h3></p> <p><span>I have never been a fan of learning a language in a classroom, having taken Russian, French and Mandarin classs. This one is a bit of a hit or miss. The classroom environment has always felt a bit too artificial for this purpose. Typically, there is also limited practice, limited individual attention (and hence </span> <em>feedback</em> <span>). And the separation between the classroom learning context and the real-life situations makes it hard to apply the knowledge.</span></p> <p><span>That said, there are some amazing teachers out there who excel at teaching and building curriculum. And for some people, the structure of learning in a group guided by a competent instructor is just what they need. For Chinese learners, </span> <a href="https://www.excelmandarin.com/" target="_blank"><span>Excel Mandarin</span></a> <span> is an example of educators who have created an effective learning system for their students. Though not from my personal experience, I have heard nothing but positive reviews about these folks. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Duolingo</span></h3></p> <p><span>There was a time when I would have a long-running practice streak on the popular free app </span> <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank"><span>Duolingo</span></a> <span>. I would use the app daily, and almost completed the curriculum for Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, and German. I felt great. I felt engaged. I felt like I was making progress. But that's the dangerous part about apps like these that try to "gamify" the language learning process. it makes you feel productive, even if it may not reflect reality. </span></p> <p><span>It is all too easy to slip into auto-pilot mode, where you just rush to the finish line of each exercise. This is similar to how one would "speed read" a book in an hour and retain nothing from it. The app also trains you to get used to the machine-generated bad pronunciation, which is counter-productive for your listening skills. On the bright side, Duolingo can be helpful for exposure to new words, and adding some structure to your learning, especially if you are not following a curriculum or textbook.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Reading Textbooks</span></h3></p> <p><span>Reading a textbook for the purpose of language learning is perhaps the best way to learn the formal structure of a language. But it is not effective for conversational purposes. Grammar rules are clean, but conversational languages are messy. Similar to the discussion above about taking classes, textbooks tend to give a similar passive understanding of rules, as opposed to the ability to apply that knowledge in real-time. </span></p>  <p><span>The best approach is the one you actually take and follow through with. One that fits your learning objectives and learning style. The more you can align your learning with your intrinsic motivation, the more likely it is that it will stick. </span></p>

<p>After the sudden and miraculous shift to remote work in March – the office fightback has well and truly begun.</p>



<p>Four months ago I wrote that – surprisingly- there was no fightback from technophobe hold-outs barricading themselves into their offices. They simply packed up their laptop and went home with the rest of us. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank">How </a><a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/">premature</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/04/06/did-a-virus-just-bring-about-the-end-of-the-office/" target="_blank"> I was</a>. </p>

<p>If you thought that 2020 couldn’t get any crazier – it seems some people really are suggesting that businesses should alter their workplace strategies in order to save…sandwich shops.</p>



<p>OK, I’m exaggerating for effect. But there really has been a hand brake applied to the move to remote/hybrid working , or my favoured term,<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/work-futures/the-future-is-minimum-office-not-zero-office-821928abdba2" target="_blank"> minimum office</a></em> in recent weeks. </p>



<p>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/27/go-back-work-risk-losing-job-major-drive-launched-get-people/" target="_blank">article in the Daily Telegraph</a>&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that employees who continue to work at home will be more vulnerable to redundancy, with bosses finding it far easier get rid of people they don’t physically see.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/KirstieMAllsopp/status/1290987043829489666?s=20" target="_blank">Kirstie Allsopp</a> led the anti-remote work charge on Twitter, suggesting that if your job can be done from home, it can be done from anywhere in the world. Who would have thought that a couple of months of working in shorts and a T-Shirt has made us more susceptible to being replaced by less expensive folk in India, Myanmar and China? </p>



<p>A debate that is framed around saving sandwich shops and an already dying high street isn’t helpful or progressive. Cynically I might suggest the real subtext here is about propping up commercial property investment portfolios. Realistically though, we won’t see anything like a return to the same number of offices, and although few will shed tears for commercial real estate investors many small businesses will suffer a big hit and go out of business unless they can pivot very rapidly.</p>



<p>Clearly there are two groups emerging, those who are desperate for the pandemic to be viewed as a temporary event before everything returns to ‘normal’ and those embracing the true long term disruption that is occurring.</p>



<p>Thank heavens then for more balanced thinkers like Tom Cheesewright who has an uncanny ability to pan back and take the long view. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tomcheesewright.com/were-still-human/" target="_blank">Writing on his website</a> about the current over-confidence in the possibilities for remote working he says:</p>



<p><em>“There is something different about being there, in person, with all of your senses engaged. It’s what I called a few years ago, ‘<a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/the-unbeatable-bandwidth-of-being-there/">the unbeatable bandwidth of being there</a>‘. What gets transmitted and received through the screen and headset, mediated by a million miles of fibre optic cable, is not the full experience of meeting. Nor does it allow for all the things that happen around those meetings. <a href="https://tomcheesewright.com/aftershocks-and-opportunities/">I’ve talked at length about the need for peer support, the subtler parts of staff training, and the mutual inspiration that happens when you’re sharing a physical space</a>.”</em></p>



<p>I’m a remote working, or at least a minimum office, enthusiast. I’ve written on this site for years about the worst aspects of office life and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2014/07/31/why-the-death-of-the-office-cant-come-too-soon/" target="_blank">the most popular post on here applauds its impending doom</a>.  Six years on though I’d admit it’s a deeply flawed argument. The idea that constant interruptions and back to back meetings were a symptom of being in a corporate building has been well and truly busted by…Microsoft Teams. </p>



<p>In truth the problem with work is not the tools or the physical location, but <a href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/01/03/ending-our-obsession-with-leadership/">the obsession with leadership</a> , an undue focus on work about work, an overbearing hierarchy and the lack of true digitisation of the enterprise. Deeper, more complex problems.  </p>



<p>It’s ironic that it has taken a pandemic to reveal what was good about the office. “The things that happen between meetings” that Tom writes about reveal our innate desire for human contact – the need to get <em>our senses fully engaged</em>. Wasteful? Quite often. But we dismiss this at our peril. It may seem logical that workplace chatter stifles productivity, but studies show the opposite to be true. </p>



<p>A narrow focus on efficiency in the workplace and a flawed view of what makes people productive is similarly regressive and likely to drag people back to the old normal. As Stowe Boyd writes the backlash against minimum office is in full flow , as detailed in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-start-to-think-remote-work-isnt-so-great-after-all-11595603397?mod=trending_now_pos1">Companies Start to Think Remote Work Isn’t So Great After All</a>, as executives want to get people back in the office:</p>



<p>“<em>An increasing number of executives now say that remote work, while necessary for safety much of this year, is not their preferred long-term solution once the coronavirus crisis passes.</em></p>



<p><em>“There’s sort of an emerging sense behind the scenes of executives saying, ‘This is not going to be sustainable,’” said Laszlo Bock, chief executive of human-resources startup Humu and the former HR chief at Google. No CEO should be surprised that the early productivity gains companies witnessed as remote work took hold have peaked and leveled off, he adds, because workers left offices in March armed with laptops and a sense of doom</em>.”</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s simply we haven’t yet matched our colleagues roles, and their specific work preferences, within our existing organisational design never mind considered a future state. Working from home (managed and supported appropriately) <strong>can</strong> be more productive than going into the office.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUMuOwyAM_JpySwQkNHDgsJf9jYiA27BNIDKmVf5-aStZHsv2-DHeEdwznvbIhVgtgHMMdtRSX1nDILTSLJb5hgC7i5slrMCOumzRO4o5vdu1Mdqw1YZJTmJYQC9SaR8kv3IlBmcmM_qgRsXeS2ZXQ4TkwcIT8MwJ2GZXoqNchp-L_G22LthnvLdIcskbcN0cQgGHfu0eKb82CHfoXhkfgKVzCN2emzswh-opPqG7Yd67Ne_Aon2P4YYPQiiteC_6M_0JzqezJnMZ-X6XfalLIecfvc87Q3u4up0kWnGhmAgwAX1K7fW54V5TpHOG5JZ2ylcV-or4eZLOA2yCV9mAGvubbFIZOWmuWNsWctMzfShljTf6B3tch00" target="_blank">A HBR study published in August</a>&nbsp;contrasted surveys of knowledge workers from 2013 and 2020, found that remote working was in fact helping address long-held frustrations about the rhythm of office work. </p>



<ol><li>Lockdown helps us focus on the work that really matters. We are spending 12% less time drawn into large meetings and 9% more time interacting with customers and external partners.</li><li>Lockdown helps us take responsibility for our own schedules. We do 50% more activities through personal choice — because we see them as important — and half as many because someone else asked us to.</li><li>During lockdown, we view our work as more worthwhile.&nbsp; We rate the things we do as valuable to our employer&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;to ourselves. The number of tasks rated as tiresome drops from 27% to 12%, and the number we could readily offload to others drops from 41% to 27%.</li></ol>



<p>The key phrase here is: <em>managed and supported appropriately</em>. Certainly managers need to reinvent themselves as mentors to this style of working and then – forgive me – get the hell out of the way. </p>



<p>The office as the default way of working is dead. But the office itself isn’t dead. With working from home, what we gain in work-life balance we might lose in innovation and creativity. There are people who could directly challenge that sentence but I suspect they will come from highly mature companies who have fully mastered the remote working learning curve. Many of us are still at the stage of doing what we did in the office , just remotely. The timorous amongst us may use the lack of productivity net gains as a reason to regress rather than push through the ‘pain barrier’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://paulitaylor.com/2020/07/11/nirvana-or-business-as-usual-navigating-the-new-future-of-work/" target="_blank">as Matt Mullenweg describes it.</a> </p>



<p>We can do so much better, for ourselves, our customers and society if we stop being so frightened or so certain of the future. </p>



<p>We are going to have fewer offices and spend more time at home. </p>



<p>Our efforts would be a lot better spent improving the experience and outcomes of both rather than arguing about preserving a status quo whose time has truly run out. </p>



<p><em>The office versus remote work?</em> It’s not a binary choice we need to make. </p>



<p>The best thing you can do in any period of change is to bet on neither black or white. The future will be made up instead of shades of grey where few things are certain and <em>the best you can do to prepare is to be endlessly adaptable</em>. </p>
