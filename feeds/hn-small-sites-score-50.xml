February 23, 2021 | https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tailscale.com/blog/modules-monoliths-and-microservices/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Lately, I get people asking me when microservices are a good idea. In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227">systems design explains the world</a>, I talked about big-picture issues like second system effect, innovator’s dilemmas, and more. Can systems design answer the microservices question?</p>
<p>Yes, but you might not like the answers. First, we'll need some history.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-microservice">What is a microservice?</h4>
<p>You can find various definitions on the Internet. Here's mine: microservices are the most extreme possible backlash against <em>monoliths</em>.</p>
<p>Monoliths are what happen when you link everything your entire app needs into one giant program and deploy it as one big blob. Monoliths have a long history, going back to frameworks like CGI, Django, Rails, and PHP.</p>
<p>Right away, let's abandon the assumption that a monolith and a fleet of microservices are the only two options. There's a wide and nuanced continuum from "one giant service that does everything" to "infinite tiny services that each do nearly nothing."</p>
<p>If you follow fads, you'll have built a monolith at least once (whether on purpose or because that's what traditional frameworks encouraged you to do), then discovered some problems with monoliths, then heard that microservices are the answer, then started rearchitecting everything as microservices.</p>
<p>But don't follow fads. There are many points in between those extremes. One of them is probably right for you. A better approach starts with where you want to put your <em>interfaces</em>.</p>
<h4 id="boxes-and-arrows">Boxes and arrows</h4>
<p>An interface is the connection between <em>modules.</em> A module is a collection of related code. In systems design, we talk about "boxes and arrows" engineering: modules are the boxes, and interfaces are the arrows.</p>
<p>The deeper question then is: how big are the boxes? How much goes in each box? How do we decide when to split one big box into two smaller ones? What's the best way to connect the boxes? There are many approaches to all this. Nobody quite knows what's best. It's one of the hardest problems in software architecture.</p>
<p>Over the decades, we've evolved through many kinds of "boxes." <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">Goto statements were "considered harmful"</a> largely because they prevented any hierarchy at all. Then we added functions or procedures; those are very simple boxes, with interfaces (parameters and return codes) between them.</p>
<p>Depending which branch of programming you go down, you then discover recursive functions, combinators, static function prototypes, libraries (statically or runtime-linked), objects (OOP), coroutines, protected virtual memory, processes, threads, JITs, namespaces, sandboxes, chroots, jails, containers, virtual machines, supervisors, hypervisors, microkernels, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernels</a>.</p>
<p>And that's just the boxes! Once you have boxes isolated from each other, then you need to connect them with arrows. For that, we have ABIs, APIs, syscalls, sockets, RPCs, filesystems, databases, message passing systems, and "virtualized hardware."</p>
<p>If you tried to draw a complete boxes-and-arrows diagram of a modern Unix system (which I won't), it would be wild: functions inside threads inside processes inside containers inside userspace, layered under a kernel, inside a VM, running on hardware in a rack in a datacenter in a cloud provider tied together by an orchestration system, and so on.</p>
<p>Each of those boxes at each of the abstraction layers is somehow isolated from and then connected to some of the others, at the same or other layers. Some are inside others. You couldn't draw an honest version of this picture in a mere two dimensions without lines criss-crossing hopelessly.</p>
<p>This all evolved over decades. Fancy people call it "path dependence." I call it a mess. And let's be clear: most of the mess no longer provides much value.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on what became very ugly evolutionary results, let's talk about what people were <em>trying</em> to do while they invented all that stuff.</p>
<h4 id="the-quest-for-modularity">The quest for modularity</h4>
<p>The top-line goals of module systems are always the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate each bit of code from the other bits.</li>
<li>Re-connect those bits only where explicitly intended (through a well-defined interface).</li>
<li>Guarantee that bits you change will still be compatible with the right other bits.</li>
<li>Upgrade, downgrade, and scale some bits without having to upgrade all the other bits simultaneously.</li>
</ol>
<p>The computer industry spends an absolutely immense amount of time messing around, trying to find the perfect balance of all these modularity issues, while still trying to keep development as painless and easy as possible.</p>
<p>We are, in short, not succeeding.</p>
<p>By far the part we're worst at is #1, isolation. If we could truly and efficiently isolate one bit of code from another, the other goals would mostly fall into place. But we simply do not know how.</p>
<p>Isolation is a super hard problem. Goodness knows people have tried. Yet browser sandbox escapes still happen regularly, undetected privilege escalation attacks are simply assumed to exist on every OS, iOS still gets jailbroken periodically, DRM never works (for better or worse), virtual machines and containers regularly have vulnerabilities discovered, and systems like <a href="https://blog.alcide.io/insecure-by-default-kubernetes-networking">k8s have their containers configured insecurely by default</a>.</p>
<p>People have even been known to <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/04/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles/">figure out encryption keys on remote servers by sending well-timed packets</a> to them over the Internet. Meanwhile, the most spectacular isolation failures in recent memory were the <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre attacks</a>, which allowed any program on a computer, even a javascript app in a web browser, to read the memory of other programs on the same computer, even across sandboxes or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Every new isolation technology goes through a cycle like the following, from optimism to despair:</p>
<ul>
<li>New idea: we'll finally get it right this time, once and for all!</li>
<li>Initial experiments seem to work.</li>
<li>(Users complain that it's even slower and more tedious than the last thing we tried.)</li>
<li>Early fatal flaws are discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Widespread deployment.</li>
<li>Ever-more-subtle flaws are successively discovered and fixed.</li>
<li>Eventually, we find flaws that we simply don't know how to patch.</li>
<li>Lose hope that efficient isolation is even possible with this method.</li>
<li>But also we can never retire this isolation method because now too many people are depending on it.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, at this point security people simply don't believe that any of the following (each one the very best technology available at the time) is totally safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process isolation and memory protection on a Unix system.</li>
<li>Privilege separation between OS processes when remote code execution ("RCE" for security people) is allowed.</li>
<li>Filtering syscalls to isolate a process.</li>
<li>Mutually untrusted processes sharing a CPU hyperthread.</li>
<li>Memory isolation between virtual machines on a CPU core.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know, the state of the art, the very best isolation, is something like the Chrome sandbox or <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">gVisor</a>. The big browser vendors and cloud providers all use tools like these. The tools remain imperfect, but providers do chase down every new breach as fast as they can, and the rate of new flaws is fairly slow.</p>
<p>Isolation is better than it's ever been before… if you put all your isolation at the virtual machine (VM) level so that your cloud provider can do it for you because nobody else knows how, or updates often enough.</p>
<p>If you trust your cloud provider's VM isolation, you can have hope that all known problems are mitigated; but we have every reason to think more problems will be found.</p>
<p>That's… actually pretty good, all things considered. At least we have <em>something</em> that works.</p>
<h4 id="great-vms-for-everything">Great! VMs for everything!</h4>
<p>Well, hold on. Spinning up an isolated VM for every little module is a pain. And how big is a module?</p>
<p>Long ago, when Java first came out, the dream was that every line of every function in every object could have permissions enforced, even between objects in the same application binary, so that CPU-enforced memory protection wouldn't be needed. Nobody believes anymore that they can make that work. And marketing claims like "cloud functions" aside, nobody really thinks you should try.</p>
<p>None of the currently-known isolation methods work <em>perfectly</em>, but each of them works to <em>some approximation</em>. Increasingly skilled attackers, or increasingly valuable targets, require better and more annoying isolation. The best isolation we know right now is inter-VM sandboxing provided by tier-1 cloud providers. The worst, well, it goes down to zero.</p>
<p>Let's also assume, skipping over the evidence, that most systems are so tightly coupled that <strong>a reasonably skilled attacker can break through laterally between modules.</strong> So, for example, if someone can link a malicious library into your Go or C++ program, they can probably take control of that entire program.</p>
<p>Similarly, if your program has write access to a database, attackers can probably make it write <em>anywhere</em> in the database. If it can contact the network, they can probably contact <em>anywhere</em> in the network. If it can execute arbitrary Unix commands or system calls, they can probably get Unix root access. If it's in a container, they can probably break out of the container and into other containers. If malicious data can <a href="https://imagetragick.com/">crash the png decoder</a>, they can probably make it do anything else the decoder program is allowed to do. And so on.</p>
<p>An especially powerful form of attack is getting the ability to commit code, because that code will eventually be run on developer machines, and some developer or production machine somewhere probably has access to do what you want to do.</p>
<p>The above is maybe a little too pessimistic, but making those assumptions can help avoid overcomplicating your systems without improving actual security. In <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf">Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0</a>, Daniel J. Bernstein points out (if I may heavily paraphrase) that many of the defenses he added in qmail, particularly isolating the different components from each other using chroot and different Unix uids, were not worthwhile and have never paid off.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's take it for granted that attackers with the ability to execute code can "usually" jump …</p></div></div>

<a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">Subscribers</a> have been following this series over the

edited, emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>The biggest unknown for me is: How do I start?</strong> What does the process of
creating a game look like? Should I build the scenes first? Should I design
the gameplay mechanics first? With business software, it’s much more familiar.
It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>While there is no single correct answer, we can still make some distinctions
that can help get us oriented. The answer will also undoubtedly depend on <em>who</em>
is doing the development: an individual, small indie team, or larger studio? If
an individual, the answer will also depend on their primary skillset: a
developer, artist, or designer?</p><p>Here, I’ll give heuristics especially helpful for individual Software Engineers
building a game on their own as a side project, hobby, or proof-of-concept.</p><figure><p><span>

Do you have a sense of what game mechanics
your game will have? Do you know what genre, controls, and themes this game will
have?</p><p>If <em>yes</em>, you’re ready to decide <strong><a href="#start-coding">where to start coding</a></strong>.
Otherwise, you have a few more questions to ask yourself.</p><h3>Do you <em>want</em> to know what you’re building?</h3><p>It’s totally fine not to have a project in mind! Maybe you’re prototyping.
Perhaps you’re throwing a bunch of mini-games on the wall and seeing what
sticks. Or you’re looking for inspiration and trying to implement random
mechanics to see what feels fun.</p><p><strong>If you’re hoping to begin working on a specific, cohesive game</strong>, you will
likely want to know what you’re building. Consider brainstorming and sketching
out an informal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document">game design document</a>.
There are
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=game+design+document+template">plenty of templates</a>
of various levels of detail you could decide to use. Especially as a software
engineer toying with abstract ideas in my brain, I’ll start with a super
high-level GDD, covering the feel, themes, genre, and mechanics of the game I
have in mind. Maybe a few pictures or sketches for inspiration, and that’s it.
The key part of this exercise will be the list of mechanics I’m working on.</p><p><strong>If you want to prototype and experiment</strong>, you should already have a vague
sense of 1-2 mechanics that could be fun: Maybe unusual movement or a different
control scheme. It could be a traditional mechanic that you’re wondering how to
implement. For instance, I might decide to build a 3rd Person character and
camera controller to see the “feel” of it, experiment with it a tiny bit, and do
something smooth and polish that I feel good about. I might end up keeping that
code in my back pocket for later, or I might use play-through sessions with that
controller to move around a scene, add a few assets, and use that as a starting
place to see the “feel” various mechanics and designs.</p><h2 id="start-coding">I know the mechanics I care about. Now what?</h2><figure><p><span>

development. You do that by failing fast and getting feedback early. In game
development, the primary metric for success is a feeling: the game should be
fun. So, when deciding what to start with when working on a game, one good
question to ask is: <em>“How can I see if this game is fun as soon as possible?”</em>
or <em>“How can I implement the ‘fun’ part of the game ASAP?”</em></p><p>One way to do that is to look at a game’s mechanics and implement them in some
order. The advice that resonates with me is implementing game mechanics in order
of what the most <em>“core”</em> mechanic first.</p><figure><p><span>

plane shooting game—as an example. Here’s my attempt at writing its main
mechanics in descending order of importance:</p><ol><li>Movement: Navigate a vertically scrolling world</li><li>Obstacles &amp; Dodging: Player can collide with stationary obstacles and debris</li><li>Shooting: Player can shoot straight ahead to defeat obstacles</li><li>Enemies: Enemies are moving obstacles that can shoot back</li><li>Player Health: A player can take a finite number of hits before losing the
game</li><li>Enemy Health: Some enemies take multiple shots to destroy</li><li>Boosts: The player can pick up boosts that improve health, shooting, etc.</li></ol><p>… and so on.</p><p>If I’m trying to develop <em>1945</em> from scratch, I will implement that list in that
order. The game’s mechanics build on each other, so I can only tell if shooting
is “fun” is if I can move around the screen and if there are obstacles I’m
trying to clear (otherwise, there’s no urgency to just pressing <em>Space</em> and
seeing projectiles coming out of a plane).</p><p>In simpler games, we might order our mechanics so that every new feature adds to
a game’s feel. So, with every new mechanic you add, you can play the game and
tell if it’s adding what you hope for it to add.</p><p>In more complex games, some of the “core” mechanics might be too ‘standard’ to
be “risky” <em>per se</em>, but you’ll still need the core mechanics implemented to
assess how fun the other mechanics are. You might choose to use a simpler
throwaway implementation, like a few lines of input-handling code and Unity’s
<code>CharacterController</code> component. You’ll want your core mechanics just smooth
enough that they don’t ruin the fun of the things you’ll layer on top of it.
Another approach here is to use the asset store. I’ve previously mentioned the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-106748?aid=1011leWs6">Ultimate FPS (UFPS)</a>
asset, which you might choose to use when building an FPS game, and move on to
implementing the combat or some more unique (but still “core” feature of the
gameplay first).</p><h2>So I picked a mechanic, but where do I start programming <em>within</em> this mechanic?</h2><p><em>Within</em> a mechanic, your traditional software engineering intuition becomes
helpful. I hope to spend subsequent articles discussing patterns that are
especially helpful in Unity, but here are a few to consider:</p><ul><li>Work within Unity’s Object-Component paradigm. If you’re adding a new
<em>capability</em> to your player, write it as its own component.</li><li><em>Tuning</em> is especially important in game development; representing a
mechanic’s interesting pieces as <em>configurable</em>, <em>serializable</em> data that
can be input to a component will help you playtest and iterate.</li><li>Don’t shy away from using plain-old data objects to represent core concepts
you’re working with. E.g., health, ammo information, or powerups. Make it
serializable if you want it passed around in the editor (or saved to disk
across sessions).</li><li>Where pieces of a concept don’t correspond to a single object in a scene,
consider using Scriptable Objects to do the jobs. Scriptable Objects
introduce many patterns that might help represent what you’re doing.</li></ul><p>A few articles I have already written might prove helpful:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts/">Basic Concepts in Unity for Software Engineers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices/">6 Software Practices to Keep, Shed, and Adopt in Unity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/09/patterns-in-unity-adventure-tutorial/">Making Sense of Patterns in Unity’s Adventure Game Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt5-object-component/">Understanding Unity Engine Objects</a></li></ul><p>You might also take a look at patterns covered in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">Three ways to architect your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,
via the Unity Blog (based on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">his talk</a>)</li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt3-input-system/">Unity Input System, from Basic Principles</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/11/unity-for-engineers-pt10-1-pathfinding/">Pathfinding with NavMesh</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/11/unity-for-engineers-pt10-2-raycasting/">Physics Raycasting</a></li></ul><p>Once you have a stronger intuition of <em>how</em> you can represent different kinds of
data and abstractions, the reader’s initial comment also becomes the answer:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond learning about useful patterns and abstractions in game development to
make development clearer and cleaner, the real takeaway is to decide <em>what</em> to
work on at a macro-level.</p><h2>How much time should I spend on one mechanic?</h2><p>As you’re developing a mechanic, what’s a good signal you should move on to the
next on your list? Generally, that would be when you’re convinced:</p><ul><li>This mechanic <em>feels fun</em> and <em>adds to the game</em>,</li><li>Your implementation adds <em>just the
<a href="https://www.e4developer.com/2018/11/21/having-just-the-right-amount-of-technical-debt/">right amount</a></em>
of technical debt.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, folks will often say to worry about polish at the later stages of
your development. In his GDC 2016 micro-talk <em>“Pizzazz First, Polish Later”</em>,
Lee Perry makes a distinction in this traditional wisdom.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8QAVGeEj-U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Certain levels of pizzazz might give you a better sense of your mechanic and how
fun it feels. A certain amount of polish or pizzazz can also help you see your
game in a new light and motivate you to keep going.
<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design/">Juice</a>
is another form of pizzazz; in certain dull moments of your game design, adding
juice might be a low-cost way to get back into the groove of things.</p><p>I hope the conflicting advice shows there isn’t a silver bullet on what to add
when. Rather—as in traditional software development—this choice is about a
series of trade-offs that depend on the developer, the project, and lots more.</p><h2>Are you developing a game or architecting systems?</h2><p>For some software engineers, we’re often drawn to writing code for systems that
seem <em>interesting</em>. Sometimes, I have a game in mind, but <em>really</em>, I’m
interested in implementing a cool inventory system where <em>everything</em> in the
game is an item. It might not be the core mechanic, but it might be the thing I
want to build.</p><p>It’s important to recognize when you’re not building a game but building a
system. If you just quit your job to be a full-time indie gamedev and have a
year of runway before your run out of cash, it is probably a bad idea to start
building a complex inventory system that you don’t even know you’ll need<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
But if you’re programming on the side to flex your game development muscle, then
go right at it.</p><hr><p>I don’t think I’m qualified <em>per se</em> to answer the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div class="page"><nav id="navbar"></nav><h2>A Practical Analysis</h2><hr><hr><h2 id="a-quick-introduction">A quick introduction</h2><p>The Playstation 2 was not one of the most powerful consoles of its generation, yet it managed to achieve a level of popularity unthinkable for other companies.</p><p>This machine is nowhere near as simple as the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/">original Playstation</a> was, but we will see why it didn’t share the same fate of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/sega-saturn/">previous complicated consoles</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>At the heart of this console we find a powerful package called <strong>Emotion Engine</strong> or ‘EE’ designed by Sony and running at <strong>~294.91 MHz</strong>. This chipset contains multiple components, one of them being the main CPU. The rest are at the CPU disposal to speed up certain tasks.</p><h4 id="the-leader">The leader</h4><p>The main core is a <strong>MIPS R5900-compatible</strong> CPU with lots of enhancements. This is the first chip that starts executing instructions after the console is turned on. The processor provides the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>MIPS III ISA</strong>: A 64-bit RISC instruction set. <em>Wait, is it me or this is the same ISA found on a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#cpu">competitor’s console</a>?</em>. Not quite, Sony enhanced the ISA by adding some instructions from <strong>MIPS IV</strong> (prefetch and conditional move) along with their own SIMD extension called <strong>multimedia instructions</strong>.</li><li><strong>32 128-bit extra registers</strong>: Another enhancement. They are better managed using multimedia instructions and are very useful for vector processing.<ul><li>These registers are accessed through a 128-bit bus, while the rest of the CPU uses an internal 64-bit bus.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2-way superscalar</strong>: Up to two instructions are executed in parallel.</li><li><strong>24 KB L1 cache</strong>: Divided into 16 KB for instructions and 8 KB for data.<ul><li>It also implements a <strong>prefetch function</strong> to cache instructions and data before they are requested. This is done by including extra circuitry that can identify which places in memory are more often requested.</li></ul></li><li><strong>16 KB of Scratchpad RAM</strong>: Also known as ‘Fast RAM’.</li><li><strong>Memory management unit</strong>: Interfaces memory access with the rest of the system.</li></ul><p>The core is complemented with a <strong>dedicated floating point unit</strong> (identified as ‘COP1’) that accelerates operations with 32-bit floating point numbers (also known as <code>floats</code> in C).</p><h4 id="a-recognisable-memory-choice">A recognisable memory choice</h4><p>Next to the Emotion Engine are two blocks of 16 MB of RAM, giving a total of <strong>32 MB</strong> of main memory. The type of memory used is <strong>RDRAM</strong> (<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#ram-available"><em>déjà vu!</em></a>) which is accessed through a 16-bit bus.</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/MemoryArch.b34c74b38be1ed34237a641ee12d48fafbb98ad28688c4ebb79fc723d8e0ab24.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="605" height="269" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/MemoryArch.b34c74b38be1ed34237a641ee12d48fafbb98ad28688c4ebb79fc723d8e0ab24.png" loading="auto"></picture></a><figcaption>Memory design of the Emotion Engine<br>You can guess where the congestion is gonna appear</figcaption></div><p>At first, this can be a little disappointing to hear, considering the internal bus of the Emotion engine is as wide as 128 bits. However, the RAM chips are strategically placed by following the <strong>dual-channel architecture</strong>, which consists in connecting both chips using two independent 16-bit buses (one bus per chip) to improve data throughput. The resulting setup provides a theoretical 3.2 GB/sec, so rest assured that memory latency is not an issue in this console!</p></div><p>At one corner of the Emotion engine there is a powerful <strong>DMA Controller</strong> or ‘DMAC’ that transfers data between main memory and Scratchpad; or between main memory and any component inside the EE.</p><p>Data transfers are done in batches of 128-bits, but here is the interesting part: Every eight batches, the main bus is temporarily unlocked. This leaves a small window to perform other DMA transfers in parallel (up to ten) or let the CPU use the main bus. This <em>modus operandi</em> is called <strong>slice mode</strong> and is one of the many modes available on this DMA unit. Bear in mind that while slice mode reduces stalls on the main bus, it does so at the cost of slowing down the overall DMA transfer.</p><h4 id="preventing-past-mishaps">Preventing past mishaps</h4><p>Whether we want it or not, with the amount of traffic happening inside the Emotion Engine, this design will eventually suffer the consequences of the <strong>Unified memory architecture</strong> or ‘UMA’. That is… multiple independent components trying to access main memory at the same time, causing congestion. Well, to correct these issues, Sony alleviated the constant need for memory by:</p><ul><li>Wrapping their processors with <strong>lots of cache</strong>. Thus, only requiring access to main memory if absolutely necessary.<ul><li>99% of cache/scratchpad mentions in this article will be for this reason.</li></ul></li><li>Adding a 128-byte <strong>Write Back Buffer</strong>: Very similar to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#ibms-enhancements">Write Gather Pipe</a>, but instead of waiting until it’s 25% full, it will check the state of the bus (i.e congested or free) first.</li></ul><p>This sounds very convenient for applications that can benefit from cache, but what about those tasks, such as manipulating Display Lists, which shouldn’t use cache at all? Luckily, the CPU provides a different memory access mode called <strong>UnCached</strong>, which <strong>only</strong> uses the Write Back Buffer. Thus, it will not waste cycles correcting the cache (product of <em>cache misses</em>).</p><p>Furthermore, the <strong>UnCached accelerated mode</strong> is also available. This one adds a buffer for speeding up read of continuous addresses in memory.</p><h4 id="other-interesting-bits">Other interesting bits</h4><p>Inside the same Emotion Engine package, there is yet-another processor called <strong>Image Processing Unit</strong> or ‘IPU’, this time designed for <strong>image decompression</strong>. The IPU can be useful when a game needs to decode an MPEG2 movie without jamming the main CPU.</p><p>Long story short, the game sends compressed image streams to the IPU (hopefully using DMA) which is then decoded in a format that the GPU can display. The PS2’s operating system also relies in the IPU to provide DVD playback.</p><p>Finally, the IPU also operates compressed <strong>High-resolution textures</strong>, which saves CPU usage and reduces large transfers.</p><hr><h2 id="co-cpus">Co CPUs</h2><p>It’s been two years since the rivals presented their <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/">latest offering</a>. If you read the former article and just started reading this one, I presume you are <em>still</em> waiting for ‘the thing’ that makes the PS2 as powerful as it seemed back then. Now, let me introduce a <em>very</em> important set of components Sony fitted in the Emotion Engine, the <strong>Vector Processing Units</strong> or ‘VPU’.</p><p>A Vector Processing Unit is a small independent processor designed to operate vectors. In particular, vectors made of four <code>floats</code>. These processors are so fast that they only spend only <strong>one cycle per operation</strong>, which can be extremely convenient for geometry processing.</p><p>VPUs are made of the following components:</p><ul><li>Some <strong>Vector Unit Memory</strong> or ‘VU Mem’: Used as a working space for the Vector unit. It stores values needed to be operated and/or the results of previous operations.</li><li>A <strong>Vector Unit</strong>: The core of the processor. It contains some memory (called <strong>Micro Memory</strong>) to store a program (called <strong>Microprogram</strong>) which instructs the unit on how to operate the data found in ‘VU Mem’.<ul><li>It implements a <strong>64-bit ISA</strong> and the execution unit is <strong>split into two parallel sub-units</strong>. The first one multiplies or adds floats, while the other one divides floats or operates integers. This enables to operate both floats and integers <strong>concurrently</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Vector Interface</strong>: Automatically decompresses vertex data coming from main memory in a format the Vector unit can understand. This unit can also transfer microprograms to Micro Memory.</li></ul><p>To start working, the vector unit needs to be ‘kickstarted’. For this, the main CPU is in charge of supplying the microcode.
There are <strong>two VPUs</strong> fitted in the Emotion engine, but they are arranged differently, giving way to different uses and optimisations.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0">Vector Processing Unit 0</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1">Vector Processing Unit 1</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0"><h4>Vector Processing Unit 0</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VU0.300aa8f5034941872e5a56f84ab61dfa3f3b2c71ede208b85d7edc99e6dd38a5.png"><picture><img name="image_cover" alt="Image" width="881" height="429" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VU0.300aa8f5034941872e5a56f84ab61dfa3f3b2c71ede208b85d7edc99e6dd38a5.png" loading="auto"></picture></a><figcaption>Architecture of VPU0</figcaption></div><p>The first VPU, the <strong>VPU0</strong>, is positioned between the CPU and the other vector unit (VPU1). It provides an ‘assisting’ role to the main CPU.</p><p>The VPU0 has two modes of operation:</p><ul><li><strong>Micromode</strong>: This is the ‘traditional mode’.

<p><small>February 23, 2021 • Reading time: 12 minutes</small></p>

<p>At this point, most developers use Git as a tool for collaboration. We have our
rote-learned commands to pull, commit, and push. And of course, there's <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">that
one coworker</a> who knows a bit more about Git than
everyone else, who helps get us back on track whenever our local repos end up in
a strange state.</p>
<p>But what if I told you that Git can be a valuable tool without ever setting up a
remote repository? I'm not just talking about having a working version of your
code base to roll back to if you mess something up, although there's that too.
Used correctly, Git can help to structure your work, identifying gaps in your
test coverage and minimizing dead code.</p>
<p>There are two subjects I'm going to avoid for the purposes of this blog post:
other developers, who are the most compelling but least interesting argument
for keeping your commit history clean, and <code>git bisect</code>, which does factor
heavily into my workflow but deserves its own blog post.</p>
<p>As with any ubiquitous developer tool, the Git user base has a lot of strong and
conflicting opinions about the one "correct" way to use it. My goal is simply to
introduce a workflow that I've been using and refining for much of my career;
take from it what you will. And, importantly, it's a workflow that has become a
vital part not just of my collaboration process, but of the way I write code.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these principles serve two purposes: they focus my work onto a
particular bugfix, feature, or goal, and they ensure that my Git history isn't
set in stone. With proper hygiene, commits can be dropped, rearranged, and split
off into other branches painlessly and without merge conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="principle-1-a-branch-must-do-one-useful-thing">Principle 1: A branch must do one useful thing</h2>
<p>When I'm managing my own projects, I have a lot of ideas that I want to see
happen. If I'm just throwing one commit after another into <code>main</code>, I'll get
halfway through implementing one feature and then jump off to hacking on
another. If any of the features get completed, it will be at the expense of a
wasteland of half-completed features that are now taking up space in my code
base.</p>
<p>In a brand-new project, sure, I'll throw a bunch of garbage commits into <code>main</code>.
My rule of thumb for when to stop this is when I can write my first effective
integration test. If there is <em>something</em> useful to test, there is now enough
substance to my project that I can have distinct tasks on the go. Trying to
break into branches too early just results in me throwing my garbage commits
into a branch instead of main.</p>
<p>In the early stages of a project, articulating the purpose of a branch can be as
simple as giving it a descriptive name. If a commit isn't moving the code base
in that direction, it can always get cherry-picked into a different branch.</p>
<p>As the project matures, I'll start using some sort of issue or bug tracking
software to flesh out what I'm trying to accomplish in more detail and
coordinate the branches for multiple related useful things.</p>
<p>I find that descriptive branch names also help to refocus my attention on what
I'm trying to accomplish. For instance, my command prompt currently looks like
this:</p>
<pre><span>10:02:19 </span><span>max</span> <span>~/Projects/mikkel.ca</span> <span>blog-post-git-as-a-solo-developer</span><span>|</span> <span>R</span><span>%</span></pre>
<h2 id="principle-2-every-commit-must-be-independent">Principle 2: Every commit must be independent</h2>
<p>So much for branches, let's zoom into a commit level. I've articulated what
concrete thing I want my branch to add, now how do I add it? Usually, there's
some poking around my code base involved in figuring that out. Sometimes I take
a wrong turn, sometimes I just get distracted. That's okay, it's part of the
process.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that every commit I make right now is going to end up
getting merged in this branch. By keeping my commits independent from one
another, I ensure that I can rearrange or cherry-pick them into new branches
if I discover that they really don't have anything to do with what I'm working
on right now.</p>
<p>If my commits are not independent, I am essentially stuck with the exact history
as it was written. Trying to tease out a commit into a different branch or move
it to the beginning of my branch history will become fraught with merge
conflicts as later commits that modified code introduced in this commit fall
like dominoes.</p>
<p>Obviously, I'm still allowed to call code written in one commit from a later
commit. That's the reason I'm doing this particular work in this particular
branch, after all. But I never touch the same code multiple times. If I have to
go back and fix something, maybe add a validation check or field that I hadn't
thought of, I'll go back to the commit where it was created rather than amending
it in a later commit.</p>
<p>Obviously, this could go on forever, which is why the "one useful thing"
principle exists. Once I've settled on what I want the code to look like for the
purposes of this branch, I merge and then start a new commit in the next branch
for further changes to the same.</p>
<h3 id="principle-2a-every-commit-must-include-its-own-tests">Principle 2a: Every commit must include its own tests</h3>
<p>Here's where keeping commits small starts to pay dividends. If the code in each
commit is small enough for me to reason about, it's small enough for me to
visually ensure that its test coverage is good.</p>
<p>And of course, if I do end up rearranging this commit or splitting it off to a
different branch, I want its tests to come along with.</p>
<p>The exception to this is integration and functional/behavioural tests, which can
and should have their own commits. In that case, the tests are really tied to
the branch level rather than the commit level, since Principle 1 implies that
there should be exactly one new test to add as a result of this branch.</p>
<h2 id="principle-2b-every-commit-must-pass-all-tests">Principle 2b: Every commit must pass all tests</h2>
<p>Again, breaking something in a commit (even if I <em>really definitely</em> intend to
fix it in a later commit) locks me into the git history as written. And
introducing a breaking change with the intention of fixing things later always
carries the risk that I'll get distracted and end up merging the breaking
change.</p>
<p>If there's some prerequisite to get this change to pass tests - say, a
preexisting bug that snuck through a hole in my test coverage - that gets its
own commit.</p>
<p>Speaking of holes in test coverage, there's another (temporary) exception here.
I don't normally practice strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven
development</a>, but if I do
fix a long-standing bug, I normally temporarily put its test in a separate
commit. I'll then rebase so that the test appears before the fix, ensure that
the test fails <em>without</em> the fix, then complete the rebase and validate that the
test now passes. Once the due diligence to validate my test is done, I can go
ahead and squash the bugfix with its test.</p>
<h2 id="principle-3-draft-commits-are-fine">Principle 3: Draft commits are fine</h2>
<p>If I know that I'll be coming back to a change later, I'm much more comfortable
setting it down and moving on to roughing in the next part of the process,
rather than finishing, polishing, and unit testing code that might need to
change before my branch gets merged.</p>
<p>In fact, I find that I waste much less time on writing tests for things that
I'll later change when I'm following this workflow to the letter than I do when
I get "lazy" and start dumping everything into big catch-all commits.</p>
<p>Some people favour TODO comments in their code, occasionally supported by
automated checks that prevent code containing "TODO" from merging. I prefer to
annotate my commit messages and leave my code clean. Normally, this looks
something like "add controller class - TODO test me". (I always put my TODOs on
the first line of the commit message, so that they show up even in short log
views.)</p>
<h2 id="principle-4-it-s-okay-to-discard-commits-completely">Principle 4: It's okay to discard commits completely</h2>
<p>Often I start a task by tidying up the surrounding code, in the same way I might
organize my desk before starting work. (I don't, but I <em>might</em>.) Sometimes that
cleanup turns out to be a valuable part of the groundwork for this change, but
sometimes it's just dead weight. Keeping my commits independent makes it easy to
discard or cherry-pick out code that turned out to be unnecessary, along with
any unit tests that went along with.</p>
<p>(I do still consider the tidying to be a valuable part of the process. It clears
my mind and refreshes my knowledge of the problem space with some simple rote
tasks before I dive into something more complex. And occasionally it results in
cleaner code.)</p>

<p>I'm not perfect.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> Obviously, it's not practical to
maintain this level of commit hygiene by making each change sequentially.
Instead, I jump around <em>constantly</em>. Doing so requires me to be comfortable in
navigating my commit history. (Conversely, it's also a good way to <em>become</em>
comfortable with navigating history.)</p>
<p>In that vein, here are some tools beyond your standard
<code>checkout</code>/<code>branch</code>/<code>pull</code>/<code>commit</code>/<code>push</code> workflow that come in handy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit --amend</code></a> – A quick and easy
way to update the most recent commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit"><code>git commit --fixup [hash]</code></a> – When
changing history, I used to find myself making a lot of commits with messages
like "merge me with xyz" if I need to revisit commits before the most recent
one. It turns out that <code>git commit</code> has flags to help with this: <code>--fixup</code> and
<code>--squash</code> will automatically suggest a fixup or squash with another commit
during rebase if the <code>--autosquash</code> flag is provided to that command. (To
enable this behaviour by default, run <code>git config --global rebase.autosquash true</code>. It won't behave any differently if there are no commit messages in the
history being edited that contain "squash!" or "fixup!".) A surprise bonus:
since the fixup operation inherits the message of the previous commit, you
won't be prompted to enter a new one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase"><code>git rebase --interactive main</code></a> – I can
also use <code>git rebase --interactive HEAD~5</code> to edit the last 5 commits, but I
find rebasing directly on <code>main</code> (or <code>master</code>, or whatever my upstream branch
is) kills two birds with one stone. It will show me all commits since I
branched off from <code>main</code>, and will simultaneously bring my branch up to date
with my latest local copy of main.</p>

		  Wouldn't it be nice if more JSON tools supported a truly
		  pretty JSON format? Demand options for truly pretty JSON
		  now! Viva la revolucion!
		</p>
		<p>
		  If only it were that easy. JSON format has become wildly
		  popular over the last decade easily passing XML as the
		  format of choice. For us humans JSON is much easier to read
		  than XML if the JSON is properly formatted. Sadly most tools
		  for viewing or formating JSON seem to be stuck on one of two
		  formats. One format is the single line format and the other
		  is a simple expanded format. There are other options though
		  with some tools.
		</p>
		<p>
		  One tool that offers more options is
		  the <span>oj</span> application
		  which is part of the
		  golang <a href="https://github.com/ohler55/ojg">OjG</a>
		  package. The <span>oj</span>
		  application will be used to illustrate the range of JSON
		  formats from the ugly up to the beauty of pretty
		  JSON. Follow along and try out your favorite JSON sample on

		<p>One Line</p>
		<p>
		  The tight one line JSON format is used when trying to
		  minimize the size of a JSON document. It is the preferred
		  format for transmitting and storing JSON as it takes less
		  bandwidth and less disk space. For viewing, it is hard for
		  the eye to find elements of interests and difficult to
		  determine element boundaries. It has to be the ugliest of
		  all JSON formats.

		  What many packages refer to as pretty is an expanded format
		  where every element and each array and object start are on
		  separate lines. The core
		  golang <code>json.MarshalIndent()</code> function produces
		  an example of this format. The format takes up so much
		  vertical space the example on the right had to be cut off to
		  avoid filling up this article with just large amounts of
		  white space.
		</p>
		<p>
		  With the expanded (pretty?) format it is certainly easier to
		  determine element boundaries but you need a large screen or
		  to be good at scrolling to find what you are looking for. So
		  the expanded format is a step up from the one line format
		  which makes it a bit prettier but it is a weak effort that
		  is not without flaws.

		<p>Sorted Object Keys</p>
		<p>
		  In many implementations JSON objects, whether implemented as
		  a golang map, Ruby Hash, Python dict, or what ever your
		  language of choice uses, the order of object elements is
		  random. That makes it more difficult to visually scan a set
		  of elements and pick out the same keyed element in each JSON
		  object. The brain is good at picking out visual or spacial
		  patterns but if the layout changes each each time there is
		  no pattern to pickup on. A visual scan has to be done,
		  looking at each key until the target is identified. JSON can
		  be made prettier by sorting the JSON object members by
		  element keys.
		</p>
		<p>
		  A sorted expanded format is a step up from just the expanded
		  format but it still suffers from taking up lot of vertical
		  space. If someone was writing the JSON by hand they would
		  probably not elect to expand the JSON to quite the level
		  that most packages or libraries do.

		  The ideal pretty JSON pretty is to have the format look like

		  make mistakes. Just like Goldilocks, the optimum middle
		  ground between a single line and a fully expanded format is
		  the goal. The
		  algorithm <span>oj</span> uses
		  considers a suggested edge to not exceed and a maximum
		  element depth allowed on a single line. Those two parameters
		  are specified as a float where the whole number part is the
		  edge and the fractional part or the number of 10ths is the
		  maximum depth on a single line. With those two parameters a
		  reasonable human style format can be achieved and the
		  results are looking rather pretty.

		  option or the <code>-b</code> option the formatted JSON now
		  has colors. While colors do make the output prettier they
		  also make it easier for the eye to discern keys, string,
		  boolean, and numbers more easily. Try it, look at the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
When developing a system,
it is important to be able to run the system in its entirety.
<p>
"Run the unit tests" doesn't count.
The complexity of your system is in the interactions between the units.
</p><p>
"Run an individual service against mocks" doesn't count.
A mock will rarely behave identically to the real dependency,
and the behavior of the individual service will be unrealistic.
You need to run the actual system.
</p><p>
"Run an individual service in a shared stateful development environment running all the other services" doesn't count.
A shared development environment will be unreliable as it diverges more and more from the real system.
</p><p>
"Run most services in a mostly-isolated development environment,
calling out to a few hard-to-run external services" doesn't count.
Those few external services on the edge of the mostly-isolated development environment are often the most crucial ones;
without the ability to run modified versions of them, your development process is crippled.
Furthermore, being dependent on external services greatly complicates where and how you can run the system;
it's much harder to, for example, run tests with the system on every commit if that will access external services.
</p><p>
"Run all the services that make up the system in an isolated development environment" counts;
it's the bare minimum requirement.
Bonus points if this can be done completely on localhost,
without using an off-host cluster deployment system.
</p><p>
Without the ability to actually run the entire system in this way while developing,
many evil practices will tend to become common.
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Testing is harder and far less representative,
    and therefore many issues can only be found when changes are deployed to production.
  </li><li>
    In turn, production deployment will cause issues more often,
    and so deployment will be more slow and less frequent.
  </li><li>
    Deploying the system to new environments is more difficult,
    since the developers aren't able to actually run the system.
    Existing practices in production will be cargo-culted and copied around indefinitely,
    even when they are unnecessary or actively harmful.
  </li><li>
    Exploratory usage of the system is very difficult,
    so it will be harder to consider using the system for purposes outside what it was originally developed for,
    and new use cases will become rare.
  </li><li>
    Downstream clients who depend on the system will also suffer all these issues,
    since without the ability to run the upstream system in development,
    they can't run their own entire system, which is a superset of the upstream system.
</li></ul>
Running the entire system during development is the first step to preventing these issues.
Further steps include writing automated tests for the system (which can be run repeatedly during development),
and using, as much as possible, the same code to run the system in development and in production.
<p>
Developers of large or legacy systems that cannot already be run in their entirety during development
often believe that it is impractical to run the entire system during development.
They'll talk about the many dependencies of their system,
how it requires careful configuration of a large number of hosts,
or how it's too complex to get reliable behavior.
</p><p>
In my experience, they're always wrong.
These systems can be run locally during development with a relatively small investment of effort.
Typically, these systems are just ultimately not as complicated as people think they are;
once the system's dependencies are actually known and understood rather than being cargo-culted or assumed,
running the system, and all its dependencies, is straightforward.
</p><p>
Being able to run your entire system during development is just about the most basic requirement for a software project.
It's not, on its own, sufficient for your development practices to be high quality;
but if you can't do this, then you're not even in the running.

									<p>When you watch documentaries about early computer innovations, particularly the late 70s, early 1980s, most of the documentaries tend to focus on Apple and Microsoft, and maybe IBM as the big innovators. But, I think often companies like Commodore, and Atari, and Tandy don’t get nearly enough credit for the role that they played.&nbsp; Let’s take a look at the Commodore PET!</p>
<p>Most of my readers are familiar with the Commodore 64, one of the best selling computers of all time. Well renowned for its great graphics and sound, but Commodore history didn’t start with this machine. So, let’s go back a little bit to the late 1970s and figure out where it all started!</p>
<h2>Commodore History Part 1 Video</h2>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eP9y_7it3ZM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>The Processor that Started it All</h2>
<p>It all began in 1974 when Chuck Peddle and a group of engineers started up a chip fabrication company called MOS Technology. Most of these guys had worked at Motorola on the 6800 processor, and so they set out to develop a compatible CPU known as the 6501 that could simply be substituted for the much more expensive Motorola CPU. As you might imagine, Motorola sued and to make a long story short, the 6502 was born, which was pretty much the same chip but changed just enough that it was no longer completely compatible with the 6800.</p>

<p>Since the chip was no longer compatible with the 6800, customers would need some way to test the chip. In 1976 Chuck Peddle also designed the KIM-1 development computer. This was a single board computer that used the 6502, and could be programmed in machine language from the keypad on the top. However, later it was possible to connect a dumb-terminal display and actually run BASIC. Programs could be saved to a cassette tape. The computer proved to be popular with hobbyists as well as engineers.</p>
<p>The 6502 would go on to be a huge success and eventually found its way into the Apple II series, the Atari 2600, the Nintendo Entertainment System, the entire line of Atari 8-Bit computers, the BBC Micro, and of course the entire line of Commodore 8-Bit machines. But back to 1976 for the moment. MOS Technologies was bought up by Commodore Business Machines, who at this point was primarily in the calculator business. Chuck Peddle managed to convince Commodore boss Jack Tramiel that calculators were a dead-end business and that they needed to produce a computer to compete with the upcoming Apple II.</p>
<h2>The MOS Technology KIM-1</h2>
<p>In 1977 the Commodore PET 2001 was born, using much of the same design as the KIM-1. Much like the Apple II, the PET was all inclusive, having an integrated monitor, keyboard, and cassette tape storage device. 1977 was a big year for the personal computer revolution. With the market introduction of the big 3, the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 computer, it was the first time that a regular person could buy an affordable computer without having to assemble it themselves.</p>

<p>The cool thing about the PET is that it was actually designed by the same guy who designed the 6502 processor. If you look at the prices of the big 3, you’ll see the PET was competitively priced. Although the Apple II did have superior hardware, which we’ll get into shortly, the PET did have the advantage that it came with a monitor and tape drive, where the Apple II required those as separate purchases.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look at the PET</h2>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the design of the Commodore PET. The first thing I want to draw your attention to is the keyboard. It’s insane, and it will drive you insane if you actually try to type on it. One thing that isn’t communicated well by video and pictures is just how small this keyboard is. The main part, excluding the number pad measures just 6in. by 2.75in. Just to put that into perspective, my iPhone 6 will essentially cover the entire keyboard. The Apple mini keyboard is actually huge by comparison.</p>

<p>The keyboard size isn’t the only problem. They layout is crazy. While the keys are technically in a QWERTY arrangement, normally the rows are offset creating diagonal lines. Not so on the PET. They are squared up. The weirdness doesn’t end there. The space bar is tiny! Normally you would expect numbers across the top row of keys, but there aren’t any. Instead you have just symbols. If you want to type a number, you have to use the number pad.</p>

<p>What is even more infuriating is the symbols. For example, if I want to type a Dollar sign or a number sign, I would instinctively press shift before the key. However, when I do that I wind up with a totally different character instead of the one I wanted. Then there’s the cursor keys. Notice that there are only 2 of them. One key cursors down, and the other key cursors right. If you want to reverse that, you have to hold down the shift key. So by using the combination of the cursor keys and shift you can cursor anywhere on the screen.&nbsp; The little back arrow? You might think that’s a backspace key. But, it’s not. It actually prints that character on the screen, and so when you make a mistake, and believe me you will, you’re going to go to push this key and it’s not going to fix your mistake and you’re going to go even more insane than you were before. The actual delete key is all the way over at the other side of the number pad.</p>
<p>To be fair, when this computer came out in 1977, most of the customers had never even used a personal computer before or a computer of any kind and so they didn’t have any pre-conceptions for what a keyboard layout should be – like we do today. It probably wasn’t quite as weird for them as it would be for us.</p>
<h2>Opening the Commodore PET</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look inside the PET, it opens like the cab of a semi truck, and even gives you a little kick stand to hold it open. Looking at these 16 RAM chips, you might think the PET came with a lot of RAM. But, you’d be wrong. The original PET only came with 4K of RAM. These are 1K by 4-bit static RAM chips. Being that cost was such a consideration for this computer, you might be wondering why they didn’t use the cheaper dynamic RAM, or DRAM? Well, static ram was and still is today much more expensive than dynamic RAM. However, DRAM has one drawback, it requires that it is refreshed every so often, which requires additional circuitry to handle that. When you’re dealing with only 4K, it actually ended up being cheaper just to use static RAM.</p>

<p>OK. So 4K is a ridiculously small amount or RAM, but it’s worse than that because the operating system actually needs at least 1K of that, leaving about 3K left over for the user. So how much is 3K of RAM? Well, the screen on the pet is 40-characters by 25-lines, meaning you need 1,000 bytes of RAM, or almost an entire kilobyte just to store one screen full of text. Essentially you had enough RAM for about 3 screens of text! To be fair though, the Apple II and TRS-80 only had 4K when they came out as well.</p>

<p>This particular PET has been upgraded a little daughter board. It’s an aftermarket 32K RAM expansion module, and that’s why it shows 31K available to BASIC on the boot screen. Let’s take a closer look at this cassette drive. This was actually just an off-the-shelf cassette recorder that Commodore bought and slightly modified. You can see the whole unit is actually mounted, in a rather clunky way in my opinion. The cassette drive was really the only storage device available for the PET at first. And with 4K of RAM, this wasn’t much of a problem.</p>
<h2>The PET Disk Drives</h2>
<p>It wasn’t until 1979 that Commodore came out with a matching disk drive. Since the PET was never really designed to use a disk drive, they decided to use the IEEE-488 parallel port as a means to connect the disk drive.&nbsp; Unlike the Apple II, the Commodore PET has no card slots inside so there’s nowhere to add a floppy disk controller card. So, what they had to do was essentially design an entire computer inside the floppy drive unit, which would handle controlling the floppy drives as well as an entire disk operating system.</p>

<p>Indeed if you take a look inside the disk drive, you’ll see it’s quite sophisticated, having it’s own 6502 processor, RAM, ROM, and I/O controllers. The PET didn’t really interact with information on the disks directly, rather it would send commands to the disk drive, such as telling it to fetch a file, and then the disk drive would take care of all of the work of finding the right data on the disk. In fact, it could even copy files or even entire disks from one drive to the other all by itself, just with a single command.</p>
<p>The PET was popular with schools and found its way into many computer labs. And while the disk drive was expensive, one of these floppy drive units could actually be connected to multiple PETs at the same time, thus saving space and money. In fact, you can see this arrangement being used in this photo from a computer lab where each table has 8 PETs connected to a single floppy drive and printer.</p>

<h2>The Commodore PET’s Display</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about the screen on the PET. The original model here is black and white. A lot of people assume it’s green, but that actually wasn’t until later models. The original one was black and white. In fact, there’s not even any grayscale. It’s just literally two colors, black and white. The screen was controlled by a clone of the Motorola 6845 CRT controller, which was also used in the IBM CGA card, among other computers. However, there was no circuitry here for color.</p>

<p>There are also no graphics modes. I mean, literally <em>none</em>. There is no way to put graphics on this machine at all. And what’s worse is that the character set is in ROM and it cannot be moved, so there’s no way to modify what the characters look like. So, you are pretty much stuck with putting characters on the screen and only the characters that came built into ROM. And that’s it.</p>
<h2>PETSCII</h2>
<p>However, there are 256 characters using a special character set called PETASCII or later just shortened to PETSCII. The character …</p></div></div></article></div>

                            <p>After <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2018/making-a-smartmeter.html">building my own smart meter using 4$ in parts</a> I started checking my electricity usage every day, which made me realize how expensive it is to heat your home. Especially since all heat and warm water in my low-energy house is made with electricity. I do have 4.8 kwp solar panels on my roof but in winter they don't cover too much for obvious reasons.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/3de1wj.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/3de1wj.png"><figcaption>On cold days I pay up to 6€ for electricity per day</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>My house is heated (and cooled) with a central ventilation system powered by a heat pump. Basically my heat pump is pulling in fresh air from outside, heating it and blowing it in all rooms and making hot water. Also I have infrared panels in every room for the <em>really</em> cold days.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/gc0kss.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/gc0kss.jpg"><figcaption>Central heating</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>It's pretty smart and even uses the absorbed heat of the house before venting it out to warm the fresh air but it has a major downside during cold days:</p>
<h4>The outside temperature has to be warmed up to room temperature by the ventilation system</h4>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/giinr0.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/giinr0.png"><figcaption>Heat exchanger in the Nilan Compact P</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>Since the air has to be heated to room temperature every °C counts. Many heat pumps take heat from the ground to pre-heat (in winter) or pre-cool (in summer) the outside air before sending it to the heat pump but that would have been too expensive for me so I chose the simple method of just using the outside air as-is.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/sbmusz.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/sbmusz.jpg"><figcaption>How a central ventilation system works - from [meco](https://www.meco.at/produkte/wohnraumlueftung/)</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Since laying about half a kilometer of air or salt tubes in my back yard was not an option I was looking for better solutions and I found it in the world of crypto currencies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/1flj1s.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/1flj1s.jpg"><figcaption>Crypto currency miner</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Some crypto currencies (don't call them "crypto", that's lame and wrong) are generated by thousands of people who run dedicated hardware to basically calculate random numbers until one cryptographically correct one is found. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/">Read more about how it actually works</a></p>
<p>Never mind how it works on a technical level, the main takeaway is that you can put some device in your house that uses electricity and produces heat. In exchange you get shares of that crypto currency coins like Ethereum or Bitcoin which you can sell on a trading platform.</p>

<p>I had 4 older AMD <strong>R9 390 GPUs</strong> laying around (for the nVidia crowd that's basically on a level with a GTX 970) and I thought it could work. They are not ideal for mining because even though they have a good hash rate (30MH/s), they are very power hungy and will use about 900 Watts combined. Mordern cards would perform much better. To see if they could still make a profit I checked the <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/eth">Cryptocompare Mining calculator</a>, put in my electricity price, the consumption and the hashrate of these cards and was surprised by the results.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/024r92.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/024r92.png"><figcaption>Not just worth it - If the price is stable I would even make a profit of <strong>4000$ a year</strong></figcaption></a></figure>
<p>So at the time I was making about <strong>3.8$ profit a day</strong> with the miner. Meaning on cold days I'd half my power bill even after paying for the electricity the miner is using. But that's just step one of the plan.</p>
<p>Now that we know it <em>is</em> worth it while the Ethereum price is higher than 900$, let's see what we can do with the heat.</p>

<p>Each of these cards are running at about 80°C (176°F). I can just harvest this heat and send it to my heatpump so it would need less energy warming the outside air. Basically I had two options.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/6by5tc.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/6by5tc.png"><figcaption>My 4 GPUs in a 4U server case</figcaption></a></figure>
<h2>Option 1: Lazy heating from within the house</h2>
<p>The central ventilation system does not only push fresh air into the house, it also sucks out the used air and uses this air in the heat exchanger to pre-heat the outside air.</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/gfuy33.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/gfuy33.jpg"><figcaption>Sucking vent before going to the heat exchanger</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Placing the miner in this room will cause the warm air to be sucked in and pushed directly into the heat exchanger together with the used air from the house. This is the lazy method because I don't really have to do anything but put the miner in the same room as the heat pump but of course there is a downside.</p>

</tbody>

<h2>Option 2: Running the miner outside the house, funneling in the heat</h2>
<p>Since I'm only running the miner when it's cold outside (and the price is high enough) I can use the cold, dry outside air to cool the miners and also recycling the warm air they produce to feed into the heat pump. I asked the technician who installed the heat pump and he said that it's a good idea.</p>
<p>So the plan is that I have the GPUs in the server case and connect the front of the case to my heatpumps inlet.</p>

<p>Okay so far the mining gains cover <strong>half of my electricity (=heating) bill</strong> but what difference does the pre-heated intake air make?</p>
<p>Let's see</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/8cu9s3.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/1024/8cu9s3.png"><figcaption>Results before and after pre-heating the air</figcaption></a></figure>

<p>This turned out much better than I hoped for. Who has ever heard of a heating system that lowers your bill when running? Also on sunny days the miner and whole heat pump are running fully on solar energy collected on my roof.</p>
<hr>

<p>(updated when new questions come up)</p>
<h2>Q: How long will the Miner stay profitable?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> My mining rig will stay profitable until the ETH price is at ~900$. Below that it'll no longer match it's own electricity bill. Might still be worth it afterwards because it does lower the electricity need of my heat pump</p>
<h2>Q: What software are you running on your miner?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I'm using <a href="https://simplemining.net/">Simple Mining</a>, it's basically a mining OS based on Ubuntu. It does all the configuration and fine-tuning for you and I had much better hash rates than on my DIY windows box. But it costs like 2$ a month to use the service and I think they also mine 1% of the time for themselves.</p>
<h2>Q: What about taxes? Can you keep 100% of your mining earnings?</h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> That's different for every state and country. <a href="https://www.bmf.gv.at/themen/steuern/sparen-veranlagen/Steuerliche-Behandlung-von-Krypto-Assets.html">In Austria</a> mining is considered commercial activity and you have to pay taxes but can deduct electricity and hardware costs.</p>
<p>If you keep your coins longer than the one-year speculation period, it's tax free.</p>

<p>The aim of the following draft is to offer some thoughts on a local name from thirteenth-century Lincolnshire, <i>Macamathehou</i>, that involves a version of the Arabic name Muhammad (Middle English <i>Makomet/Macamethe</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet</i>). Whilst it has been plausibly seen as an instance of a variant of the name of Muhammed being used to mean 'heathen', 'pagan idol' or similar (based on the false but common medieval Christian belief that the prophet Muhammad was worshipped as a god), here in reference to a barrow that was considered to be a pre-Christian site, it is worth noting that there are a small number of people with names and surnames derived from Arabic <i>Muḥammad</i> apparently living in twelfth- to fourteenth-century England.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ER6e7-JsI/X7AZDfw1bCI/AAAAAAADLhw/ULvdpDuWKwAelDOKu23y5ZJFgTBdhTdMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s879/macamathehou-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="355" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hhv-Lu79n_o/X7AZDcDbe6I/AAAAAAADLhs/RS2oeTJ3IocU1SGmohUZdB7Q-nFhCH-sgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/macamathehou-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Figure 1: the location of Macamathehou between Spridlington and Faldingworth parishes in Lincolnshire; click the image or <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w4ER6e7-JsI/X7AZDfw1bCI/AAAAAAADLhw/ULvdpDuWKwAelDOKu23y5ZJFgTBdhTdMgCLcBGAsYHQ/s879/macamathehou-large.jpg">here</a> for a larger version (image: C.

<p>The existence of the intriguing local name <i>Macamathehou</i> in the parish of Spridlington, Lincolnshire, was first noted in 2001 by Kenneth Cameron, John Field and John Insley in <i>Place-Names of Lincolnshire VI </i>(<i>PNL</i>), with both attestations of the name dating from the thirteenth century (the reign of King Henry III, 1216–72).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn1">1</a>) They identify the two elements of the name as being Old Norse <i>haugr</i>, 'mound, barrow', and Middle English <i>Makomet/Macamethe</i>, which derives from the name of the prophet Muhammad (Medieval Latin <i>Machometus/Mahumetus</i>, Anglo-Norman <i>Mahumet/Mahomet/Machomete</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet</i> &lt; Arabic <i>Muḥammad</i>, probably via an Arabic regional form <i>Maḥammad</i>).(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn2">2</a>) Needless to say, this solution is most intriguing and has, moreover, found favour with other place-name specialist, including the <i>Vocabulary of English Place-Names </i>(<i>VEPN</i>) and Richard Coates.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn3">3</a>)</p><p>As to the import of this name, the easiest conclusion—and the one endorsed by&nbsp;<i>PNL</i>, <i>VEPN</i>&nbsp;and Coates—is that the first element, <i>Macamethe/</i><i>Maumate</i> etc, is not functioning simply as a normal Middle English rendering of the name Muhammad/<i>Mahomet</i>, but rather as a word indicative of heathen or pagan idolatry, based on the false but common medieval Christian belief that the prophet Muhammad was worshipped as a god. So, <i>PNL </i>describes the name as meaning 'the heathen mound', with the first element being 'a corrupt ME [Middle English] form of the name of the prophet Mohammed, for which <i>v.</i>&nbsp;MED [<i>Middle English Dictionary</i>], s.v. <i>Makomete</i>, also used to denote a pagan god or an idol'.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn4">4</a>) This is taken up by Richard Coates, who says that it has been suggested, 'with great plausibility', that <i>Macamathehou </i>in Spridlington parish 'is a Middle English name meaning "Mahomet mound", i.e. "heathen mound"', and points to 'the repeated compound of OE <i>hæðen </i>+ <i>byrgels "</i>heathen burial"' as a potential comparison.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn5">5</a>) Likewise, the <i>VEPN</i>'s draft section on M includes the following discussion:</p>

<blockquote><b>makomet </b>ME, 'idol, pagan god', an application of the name of the Arab prophet Mohammed (commonly though mistakenly believed by medieval Christians to have been worshipped as a god)... It occurs early in
<i>Macamathehou </i>(f.n.) 1216–72 L:6·211 (<b>haugr</b>), presumably to be
interpreted as 'heathen mound'.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn6">6</a>)</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, this interpretation is probably the safest option. There are certainly a handful of references to 'heathen' barrows in Old English charter bounds, for example <i>of leofwynne mearce to þam hæþenan beorge</i>, 'from Leofwine's boundary to the heathen barrow', in the charter S956 relating to Drayton, Hampshire, and dated AD 1019, although none are recorded from Lincolnshire.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn7">7</a>) It has also been suggested that the Lincolnshire names Bloater Hill (North Willingham) and Blod Hou (Barrow-on-Humber) derive from Old Norse <i>blóthaugr</i>, 'a sacrificial mound', whilst other names involving <i>haugr</i> certainly refer to supernatural/demonic creatures—for example, <i>Gasthehowe</i>/<i>Gastehowe</i>, Ashby Puerorum (Lincolnshire), recorded in the thirteenth century and deriving from Middle English <i>gast</i>/Old English <i>gāst</i>, 'ghost, dead-spirit', or names like Scratters (<i>Scrathou</i>, in Hayton, East Riding of Yorkshire) and Scrathowes (<i>Scrathou</i>, in Osmotherley, North Riding of Yorkshire), which derive from Old Norse <i>skratti</i>, 'devil, wizard'&nbsp;+ <i>haugr</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn8">8</a>) Furthermore, the Old English compound <i>hæðen&nbsp;</i>+ <i>byrgels</i>, 'heathen burial', does indeed recur frequently in Late Saxon charter bounds, with these names often said to be identifiable with barrows in the landscape.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn9">9</a>)</p><p>On the other hand, there are some possible issues with this explanation, and other interpretations are possible of Spridlington's <i>Macamathehou</i>. First, the comparison with the many instances of the OE compound <i>hæðen </i>+ <i>byrgels</i>, ‘heathen burial’, is perhaps not as convincing as it might seem. Not only is a link between this term and barrows only demonstrable in a handful of instances, but Andrew Reynolds has also suggested that the sense of the term was primarily not ‘pagan’, but rather ‘unconsecrated’, and that it denoted burials of executed offenders and other social outcasts, which renders the proposed value of these names as support for interpreting <i>Macamathehou&nbsp; </i>as meaning ‘heathen mound’ open to significant debate.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn10">10</a>) Second, if the above is correct, then this would be the only known instance of a derivative of the Arabic name Muhammad being used in a place-name to indicate a 'heathen mound' or similar, which is potentially concerning—the other elements noted above all recur in multiple names. Third, the element identified by <i>PNL </i>and <i>VEPN</i> as being present in <i>Macamethehou</i> is Middle English <i>Makomet(e)</i>. The <i>Middle English Dictionary</i> (<i>MED</i>) on <i>Makomet(e)/</i><i>Macamethe</i> etc, however, makes it clear that the primary use of this word in Middle English is as a form of the name Muhammad, not as a word referring to an 'idol'/'pagan god', with the vast majority of quotations provided by the <i>MED </i>referring either the prophet Muhammad or people named Muhammad; the only exceptions are a single quotation from Layamon's <i>Brut </i>(<i>c.</i>&nbsp;1200, <i>mahimet</i>, lacking the <i>-c-</i>), and three from two later texts.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn11">11</a>) The form of the name Muhammad that <i>was </i>primarily—although not exclusively—used in the sense 'pagan deity, idol', is rather <i>Maumet/Maumate</i>, mentioned above, deriving from Anglo-Norman <i>Maumet</i>, a reduced form of <i>Mauhoumet</i>, Old French <i>Mahomet/Mahommet</i>.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn12">12</a>)</p>
<p>In this light, it is worth considering whether it is possible that the name <i>Macamathehou</i> could somehow be named from a person named <i>Makomet</i>/Muhammad or similar living in medieval England. Certainly, it should be noted that multiple local names relating to mounds/barrows do seem to be named after people who owned estates or land in the area. For example, Andrew Reynolds draws attention to the bounds of a mid-tenth-century charter for Swallowcliffe, Wiltshire (S468), that records the burial site of a seventh‐century woman whose grave had been cut into an existing mound as <i>Posses hlaew</i>, noting that 'Poss is a male name, and thus the mound is apparently not named after its Anglo‐Saxon occupant', implying that it was instead named after a later estate owner.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn13">13</a>) As Irene Bower long ago pointed out, such a situation can be credibly paralleled in Lincolnshire, with a number of Lincolnshire names involving <i>haugr</i> seeming to contain the same personal-name as is found in the same or a neighbouring parish-name—so, <i>Scalehau </i>(<i>Skalli </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was located near to Scawby (<i>Skalli</i>&nbsp;+ <i>bȳ</i>), with Kenneth Cameron commenting that the two were 'no doubt named from the same man'; <i>Leggeshou</i> (<i>Leggr </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was located on the boundary of Legsby parish (<i>Leggr&nbsp;</i>+ <i>bȳ</i>); <i>Katehou/Catehowe </i>(<i>Kati</i>&nbsp;+ <i>haugr</i>) was located in South Cadeby (<i>Kati&nbsp;</i>+ <i>bȳ</i>); and a <i>Grimaldeshawe</i> (<i>Grimaldi </i>+ <i>haugr</i>) was recorded in the neighbouring parish to Grimoldby (<i>Grimaldi</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>bȳ</i>), perhaps on the boundary between the two.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn14">14</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nu02Jqw5h14/X7WB-D0A8sI/AAAAAAADLvg/p_vwSAkF6RQX5KkB8XMvM6WiC4a1eyI5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1296/PipeRoll-Mahumet1160-1.jpg"><img data-original-height="216" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VAcqNuGj78U/X7WB-YLMzBI/AAAAAAADLvk/_TLGpi35Olg-dWNhgmcuMcZSaz-qhCgdACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/PipeRoll-Mahumet1160-1-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Figure 2: Section from the Pipe Roll Society publication of&nbsp;The Great Roll of the Pipe for the Seventh Year of the Reign of King Henry the Second, A.D. 1160–1161 (London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1885), p. 10, dealing with Mahumet of Wiltshire (image: <a href="https://archive.org/details/piperollsociety04pipeuoft/page/10/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>).</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As to the likelihood of someone named Muhammad or one of its Anglo-Norman/Middle English variants (<i>Mahumet</i>,<i> Makomet</i> and similar) actually living in medieval England, this is perhaps less far-fetched than might be assumed. Katharine Keats-Rohan and John Moore have directed attention to the Wiltshire entries of five consecutive Pipe Rolls of Henry II (1160/61–1164/65) that refer to a man named <i>Mahumet, </i>whose name-form Moore considers very difficult to explain as anything other than a rendering of Muhammad and which is accepted as such by the <i>OED </i>and <i>MED</i>. This <i>Mahumet </i>is recorded in the Pipe Rolls only because he was fined for his part in an unlicensed duel with a John de Merleberge, probably in or near Marlborough Castle, and it seems he was not an especially wealthy man, as he was pardoned the last mark of his fine due to his poverty.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn15">15</a>) Furthermore, <i>Mahumet</i> of Wiltshire was not the only man with this name for whom we have evidence from medieval England. For example, a Theobald <i>filius Mahumet</i> (or <i>filius Mahomet</i>) is recorded from early thirteenth-century Hampshire in the Pipe Rolls of Henry III for 1222–24; another man named <i>Mahomet </i>is recorded in 1327, when Edward III issued him and six others a pardon at Newton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire, for 'offenses in Ireland'; and a <i>Mahummet Saraceno</i>&nbsp;occurs in the Close Rolls of Henry III for 1254. Furthermore, a number of people surnamed <i>Mahumet </i>and similar are recorded in documents of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, for example a Humphrey Mahumet in a charter of Southwick Priory, Hampshire, a Herbert Maumet who was sergeant of Portsmouth in the mid-thirteenth century, and a Radulphus Maumet who is recorded in the reign of King John.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2021/01/macamathehou-in-lincolnshire.html#fn16">16</a>) Moore also notes the presence of someone bearing another 'apparent Arab name' in twelfth-century Hampshire, a certain <i>Paucamatus</i>, a name that he considers to probably reflect <i>Bakmat</i>, who is recorded in Winchester from 1159/60 until 1183/4 and who is associated with …</p></div></div>

<p><span>I</span>n Beijing’s southwestern outskirts, past a four-lane overpass with sidewalks as wide as the streets themselves, is Zhengyang Road. It has the usual banks, small convenience stores, and noodle houses of many areas in the capital, but it is set apart by a row of about a dozen shops all selling the same thing — tiny electric cars. The cars look, variously, like small Range Rovers, golf carts, trolley cars, or rickshaws with sheet-iron sides, and they are slow. Their fundamental attraction is their price — between $600 and $2,500 — and that drivers can charge them the same way they would a cell phone. They also come with the perks of being loosely regulated. These low-speed electric cars, nicknamed “elderly transport vehicles,” have an enormous market, made up mostly of people who earn very little. And in China, there are a lot of them — <a href="http://english.www.gov.cn/premier/news/202005/29/content_WS5ed058d2c6d0b3f0e9498f21.html">more than 40%</a> of the population, or some 600 million people, make around $150 per month.</p>



<p>On a Sunday afternoon in October, Zhengyang Road is filled with potential customers chatting with store owners.<strong> </strong>Outside a shop with a worn sign, a young couple with a child are in the midst of a heated conversation.<strong> </strong>They came on an electric scooter and are debating whether to leave with a tiny car.</p>



<p>“Don’t we need one for school pickups?” the woman argues. “The children won’t have to put up with the cold in winter.” Her scooter offers no protection from the weather other than oven-mitt-like gloves secured to its handlebars. Her husband counters, “The 1,000 renminbi [$150] quote was for normal batteries, but lithium ones can be five times that. Can’t you just add a windshield to your scooter instead?” The shop owner shows them a cheaper model — which is cheaper because it has no roof. He suggests putting a plastic covering on top.</p>

<p>Having decided that the future of mobility is electric,<strong> </strong>the Chinese government has subsidized sales of standard electric cars since 2010. With <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/394229/plugin-electric-car-sales-china-2019/">close to 1.18 million sold</a> in 2019, China accounts for just over half of electric-vehicle sales globally. Bill Russo, founder and CEO of advisory firm Automobility Limited, sees a “steady and solid rise” in China’s electric-vehicle sales generally. The country has set a top-down target for electric vehicles to <a href="http://energy.mit.edu/news/chinas-transition-to-electric-vehicles/">make up 40%</a> of car sales by 2030, and Russo thinks they’ll have no problem hitting this goal. Tiny cars,<strong> </strong>which first began appearing in the early 2010s,<strong> </strong>have more than double the sales of regular electric cars but have<strong> </strong>never benefited from subsidies. Nor do advertisements for them air on television — instead, they appear on Kuaishou, a short-video platform popular with people living outside China’s big cities. Alongside streamers selling plums by the thousands, and others telling viewers what long-haul trucker life is like, drivers show off their tiny cars. Su Hua, Kuaishou’s founder, has long maintained that his app’s users are not “cool,” unlike those on Douyin, the TikTok predecessor popular with China’s urban elite. Rather, they are ordinary — the kind of people who might be in the market for miniature cars.</p>



<p>As they don’t technically require licenses, tiny cars tend to be popular with migrant workers, who struggle to pay for driving lessons and other car-related costs. The elderly, too, find tiny cars attractive since, up until October of last year, people over 70 could not apply for a driving license in China. They’re also convenient for anybody who wants a car to pick up groceries or their kids from school: No tiny car is longer than 1.5 meters, and their speed tops out at between 40 and 56 kilometers an hour. They’re for the short trips of daily life, not for traveling from one side of the city to another.</p>



<p>Some cities have banned sales of tiny cars — Beijing did so in 2018. Their production isn’t regulated by the government, and since they can’t be insured in many parts of China, it can be difficult for other drivers to get a payout if a tiny car is involved in an accident. Because tiny-car drivers don’t need to take a driving test, other drivers complain, they often go the wrong way and weave in and out of traffic. But since enforcement is lax, sales have quietly resumed in Beijing over the past two years. These little electric cars now exist in a kind of regulatory gray zone.</p>

      <figcaption>Tiny cars come in a variety of styles and cost between $600 and $2,500.</figcaption>
    </figure>


<hr>



<p><strong>One of the</strong> smaller shops on Zhengyang Road is officially known as Xinlei Scooters, its name emblazoned in white characters on a large red sign above its doors. But inside, past rows of electric scooters, is a smaller, flimsier plaque above the counter announcing its other name: Shitou Cars. This subterfuge is necessary because the police could shut down the operation and confiscate its vehicles if the owners were caught selling tiny cars. Yet because enforcement hasn’t been strict of late, attempts at being covert go only so far: There are several tiny cars parked outside, an open-air showroom.</p>



<p>Xinlei/Shitou’s owner is a middle-aged man with pronounced cheekbones wearing a black tracksuit. He is more attentive to the phone calls he’s constantly receiving than the customers in the shop. It is his wife, with dyed-dark-brown hair and a pink coat, who maintains the sales patter: “I taught an auntie who had never driven a car before. She got the hang of it in three days.” She shows the cars outside to potential customers, opening their doors, instructing people to sit inside, and rolling down the windows. When two old men come in for repair services, her husband finally gets off the phone to deal with them. Meanwhile, two government functionaries in black uniforms pace down the street. They tell one owner to make his storefront tidier, but otherwise overlook the illicit operation.</p>



<p>Part of the reason why tiny cars are so popular is because there has not been an official decision on whether they need license plates. For regular cars, unfettered access to Beijing’s inner city — anywhere within the fifth ring road — is restricted to vehicles with Beijing plates. Licenses for gas cars are distributed through a special system so competitive that it has generated its own black market. License-plate holders can collect up to $2,700 a year by renting them to those who want to drive in the city. In addition to government subsidies, getting around some of the more onerous aspects of the licensing system is one of the main selling points for standard electric cars.</p>



<p>With Beijing temperatures reaching lows of 4 degrees Celsius in wintertime, Xinlei/Shitou has been selling,<strong> </strong>on average, two of its four-wheeled fully enclosed models every day, a saleswoman boasts. Younger couples prefer four wheels, she adds, while older people usually want three. When asked about the possibility of a tiny car being confiscated, she draws in a breath. “Don’t go on the main roads. Don’t make a business out of it,” she advises.</p>



<p>At least one of Zhengyang Road’s customers isn’t listening: Guo Caiying, who works primarily in the construction-supply industry,<strong> </strong>chauffeurs Fengtai residents around her district. She has a sticker on her tiny car’s back window with the phone number of her car dealer. Guo’s car looks like a golf cart, with cushioned brown seats enclosed by windows. A red <em>fudai</em>, a lucky charm, swings from the ceiling, its characters spelling out “peace.” There is enough space for two people to comfortably sit upright but not enough to extend your legs without hitting the plexiglass divider between driver and passenger. The car tops out at 40 kilometers an hour, and<strong> </strong>as a result, Guo never ventures beyond Fengtai — a borderland where urban and rural meet.</p>



<p>Guo wears the uniform of the countryside: a padded jacket. She is from Henan, a province 800 kilometers southwest of Beijing, and speaks its dialect. Guo starts taking calls from her regulars around 7 a.m., arriving at their door whenever they want to be picked up. She stops driving at 9 a.m., when the traffic police begin work. She characterizes her customers as “people with money who sit in offices.” Once, while in the middle of a trip, Guo saw a cop stop a car like hers. She kept driving, but dropped her passenger off before their destination. Now, if a customer calls her after 9:00, she sends her husband to pick them up with his electric scooter. He charges 75 cents (5RMB), which is half her price. Guo’s flat rate was fixed by the tiny-cab drivers who preceded her.</p>



<p>The economy of tiny cars depends on such informal practices.<strong> </strong>When asked whether she would consider undercutting other drivers, Guo is adamant. “No one can break the rules,” she says. There are local WeChat groups for tiny-car drivers that new owners are inducted into upon purchasing one. Within these groups, members swap information on the whereabouts of local cops and whether anyone has been fined or had their car taken away.</p>



<p>Despite the risks, Guo still thinks it’s worth being a tiny-car driver to make a little pocket money.<strong> </strong>Tiny cars are part of a last-mile economy that flourishes at the beginning and end of the workday. Many Fengtai residents are employed at the local high-tech park, which is host to thousands of businesses. It takes 20 minutes to walk from one end of the park to the other, a trip many would rather make by tiny car. The cars’ main competitors are share bikes, which are cheaper but lack space for luggage and can’t be split with a friend. Tiny cars are also more social — a feature Guo tries …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>During late 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS Lite had a leftover feature in its SoC allowing it to easily have cheap hardware video output. With a little circuitry and some software hacks, we were able to restore it and make it usable for anyone. No FPGA’s, no bulky or cumbersome hardware. This mod is specially useful to revive consoles with only the lower screen, being able to watch the upper screen on your TV. Or to create a GBA Macro with additional TV Output.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/DSTVOUT.jpg" width="250" height="250"><br></center>
<center>
  <b>First iteration of the TV-OUT board in action</b>
  </center>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>If you are just interested in installation, this is the current method <strong>while we work on simpler methods</strong> and more features you have requested:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://ezflash.sosuke.com/wiki/index.php/Flashme">flashME CFW</a> (Custom FirmWare) on your DS Lite</li>
  <li>Connect the Nintendo DS Lite’s upper screen flex to the PCB board.</li>
  <li>Donwload the “NDS TV OUT ENABLE.nds” homebrew from the <a href="https://github.com/LostNintendoHistory/Lost-NDS-TV">NDS TV OUT repo</a></li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases">Twilight Menu</a></li>
  <li>Copy both the NDS TV OUT ENABLE and Twilight Menu .nds files to a flashcart.</li>
  <li>Use flashme to autoboot into the flashcart. You can do this by pressing A + B + Start + Select while booting. Run Twilight menu, and from there, run the enabler homebrew.</li>
  <li>The console will return to Twilight Menu. Now you can use the buttons on the board to swap between the different screen modes (Upper Screen to TV, Bottom Screen to TV, etc) and launch your games.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The retail firmware of the Nintendo DS Lite disables this specific feature early in the boot process. To reenable it, we use a custom firmware like flashme, which is very easy to install and is required only once, plus a homebrew. Despite that, we are working on an even simpler solution to make it available to as many people as possible, our own custom firmware which integrates patches to enable this feature directly on boot. Additionally, we are currently working with homebrew developers to integrate control of this new feature into existing software for the DS Lite.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>This feature is only found on the Nintendo DS Lite. Nintendo DS Phat does not contain this feature nor does the Nintendo DSi. It is important to remark that <strong>this is not the same hardware</strong> found on Devkits or other special units. This hardware feature is present in virtually <strong>every single Nintendo DS Lite</strong> out there. The reason why it was left there is unknown, but as said before, it is not related to development units, those use a different video capture hardware. Perhaps Nintendo imagined the Nintendo Switch as early as 2006?</p>

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/PCB_Rev_11.png" width="350" height="400"></center>

<p>We only need a few extra hardware components to make this video signal usable. You will be able to download the schematics and gerber files for our open hardware circuit board <a href="https://github.com/LostNintendoHistory/Lost-NDS-TV">from the repository</a>. The latest version is revision 1.2 which fixes some minor issues with a component in the board.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LostNintendoHistory/lostnintendohistory.github.io/main/img/NDSTVOUT/Prototype.jpg" width="350" height="350"><br>
</center>
<center>
  <b>First prototype and tests before designing a proper board</b></center>


<p>The final, production-ready board contains a DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter) which turns the 10 bits digital signal at 16.7 MHz provided by the DS Lite into a proper analogue signal. This signal then goes through an operational amplifier and it’s ready to be delivered to your nearest TV trough composite video.</p>

<p>We are currently considering creating an additional PCB revision which would allow to install the mod on consoles without lossing a working upper screen.</p>

			<p><strong>The Bombard Story</strong> is the account of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bombard">Alain Bombard’s</a> amazing journey in 1952 across the <a href="http://greatestadventurers.com/the-north-west-passage-by-roal-amundsen/">Atlantic</a> on a small 14-foot inflatable boat. Alain Bombard left without food or fresh water and sailed 4.400 kilometers. He lost 25 kg. but proved his point: Man can actually survive on ocean water for an extended period of time!</p>

<p>As a doctor, Bombard was concerned about the hundreds of deaths at sea every year related to sailors drinking ocean water. He developed the theory that humans can not just survive but live for years on seawater. This sounds very strange, but his big idea was to begin drinking seawater, while you are still hydrated – and in small quantities. It turns out that saltwater is only dangerous if you are dehydrated and suddenly drink large amounts of it. – The way shipwrecked sailors typically would do when they run out of fresh water. From the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some time I had made a study of the resistance of the human organism to privations and had convinced myself that it was possible for an individual to survive beyond the limits normally assigned by physiological science. I had paid particular attention to the case histories of political deportees, prisoners, and undernourished populations. But, with my background as a doctor, for whom the teachings of science remain a dead letter unless they can find practical application, my theoretical studies only seemed to lead to the question: ‘What use can made of this knowledge?’</p></blockquote>
<p>Bombard ate spoonfuls of plankton that he collected in a fine net and he also drank juice made from pressed fish he caught along the way. Sound disgusting, but the man survived and he might have discovered an important piece of knowledge for survival on the ocean.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My recent article, <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/9150"><em>The reshaped Mac experience</em></a>, received a lot of attention judging from the response on Twitter and the WordPress analytics — apparently, among other places, it reached Hacker News and Reddit. Unlike my four-part series&nbsp;<em>‌Mac OS Catalina: more trouble than it’s worth</em>, however, it didn’t attract any hate mail at all. The sheer majority of feedback I received was very positive, with many many people agreeing with me and my observations. A few — some provocatively, some genuinely curious — asked me something along the lines of, <em>Well, if you dislike the current Big Sur UI and Mac experience, what’s an example of Mac OS UI and experience you DO&nbsp;like?</em></p>
<p>It’s a more than fair question, and this piece serves as an answer. When I wrote back to those who asked me, I replied <em>Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</em>. It was sort of a gut-reply based largely on fond memories of using that Mac OS version quite extensively.</p>
<p>When I purchased my 15-inch MacBook Pro in July 2009, it came with Mac OS X 10.5.7 (Leopard), but I immediately upgraded to Snow Leopard when it was released a month or so afterwards. As you know (and if you don’t, here’s a refresher), together with Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, Snow Leopard was one of the Mac OS versions with the longest lifespan — almost two years, from August 2009 to July 2011, when the final 10.6.8 v1.1 minor release came out. On my 2009 MacBook Pro, I kept using it until mid-2012, as Mac OS X 10.7 Lion (released in July 2011) didn’t fully convince me at first, so I waited until at least version 10.7.3 before upgrading.</p>
<p>So, I used Snow Leopard on my 2009 MacBook Pro for about three years, and then again on a 2010 Mac mini that a friend gave me to maintain, as a sort of offsite backup. That Mac mini was kept on Mac OS X 10.6.8 for the whole four years it was in my custody (2011–2015) and it was switched off only twice during that period and maybe restarted four or five times in total. It enjoyed an insane uptime and it was a testament to Snow Leopard’s stability.</p>
<p>But back to my ‘gut-reply’, I wanted to be certain that my fond memories of Snow Leopard weren’t just nostalgia. While I am confident when I say that Snow Leopard is the most stable version of Mac OS, I wanted to make sure its user interface was really the good user interface and experience I was remembering. So, after a few frustrating attempts at creating a virtual machine on my current iMac with Mac OS High Sierra, I decided to install Snow Leopard on a USB flash drive, and boot my 2009 MacBook Pro (yes, it’s still alive <span>&amp;</span> kicking) in Snow Leopard from that flash&nbsp;drive.</p>

<em>Ah, When Mac OS welcomed you after the installation process was complete…</em></p>
<p>Since the MacBook Pro doesn’t have an optical drive anymore, I had to create a bootable USB flash drive from my original Snow Leopard DVD Installer. The fastest method is to use Disk Utility — rather, an older version of Disk Utility, from a time when this application was <em>really</em> a utility, and you could use the Restore feature <em>reliably</em> to clone the bootable DVD to (in this case) an external volume.</p>
<p>From a bootable USB flash drive to another USB flash drive, installation was relatively fast, about 20–25 minutes. Although I would have preferred an external SSD for the speed, I must say that using Snow Leopard from the flash drive is a breeze nonetheless. The system is responsive and I haven’t noticed any particular lags.</p>
<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>Now let’s examine just a few aspects of Snow Leopard’s user interface — just like I did for Big Sur in my logbook — and draw comparisons with Big Sur’s interface.</p>
<h3>The menu&nbsp;bar</h3>
<p>Back in August 2020 when I started testing the first Big Sur beta versions, <a href="http://morrick.me/archives/8954">I wrote in my Big Sur logbook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Big Sur, the menu bar by default isn’t solid white, but has a noticeable degree of transparency: it takes the colour of the desktop wallpaper behind it, in an attempt to blend in with the rest of the desktop environment. Some may consider this sleek, but it’s just gimmicky and usability-hostile.</p>
<p>What happens when the desktop wallpaper has darker colours? Well, menu items and menu bar icons become white, of course. The problem is that the wallpaper doesn’t have to be too&nbsp;dark.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, when Big Sur decides that the desktop background image is dark enough, text and icons on the menu bar become white. The problem is that there are cases where the background colour simply <em>isn’t</em> dark enough to warrant a change from black text and icons to white text and icons. Consequently, the contrast is too poor. The only option for better usability is to select <em>Reduce transparency</em> in <em>System Preferences</em> → <em>Accessibility</em>. This brings the menu bar back to a useful state, solid white with black elements.</p>
<p>In Snow Leopard, the menu bar has transparency set to <em>on</em> by default, but it’s definitely more subtle, even with darker desktop backgrounds:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=960%2C500" alt="" width="960" height="500" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=260%2C135 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=640%2C333 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=768%2C400 768w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/03-subtle-menubar-transparency.png?resize=1194%2C622 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><em>In the top image, menu bar transparency is off; in the bottom image, transparency is on. The difference is almost negligible.</em></p>
<p>Only with certain background images that contain dark and light areas starkly juxtaposed can menu bar transparency become a bit of an issue under Snow Leopard, but that is partly mitigated by the visible drop shadow beneath the menu bar itself, which helps to make the menu bar stand out&nbsp;more:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=960%2C672" alt="" width="960" height="672" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?w=1000 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=260%2C182 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=640%2C448 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/04-menubar-translucency-on.png?resize=768%2C538 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Contrast, even in these conditions, tends to be more tolerable than in Big Sur, at least for my eyes. And in any case, in Snow Leopard you can quickly turn off transparency right in <em>System Preferences</em> → <em>Desktop <span>&amp;</span> Screen Saver:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?resize=748%2C658" alt="" width="748" height="658" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?w=748 748w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?resize=260%2C229 260w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05-Desktop-SSaver.png?resize=640%2C563 640w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><em>I’ve been talking about ‘transparency’, whereas it’s actually ‘translucency’ — at least in Snow Leopard.</em></p>
<h3>Finder windows</h3>
<p>In Snow Leopard, Finder windows are essentially perfect from a user interface standpoint.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=850%2C558" alt="" width="850" height="558" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?w=850 850w, https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=260%2C171 260w, https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=640%2C420 640w, https://i1.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/06-Finder-Window.png?resize=768%2C504 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>When I shared this over Twitter, Mario Guzmán <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioGuzman/status/1360651998358425601?s=20">observed</a> that <em>Things are nicely compartmentalized by color. You can distinctly tell each section of the window (even the damn scroll bars)… it’s not just one blob of white with grey symbols.</em></p>
<p>Exactly this. The window has clearly distinguishable areas: the <em>Title bar</em> (with the semaphore controls at the top left of the window, and the sidebar+toolbar show/hide toggle button at the top right), the <em>Toolbar</em>, the <em>Sidebar</em> (with colourful icons helping you quickly and easily locate items at a glance), the <em>Path bar</em>, the <em>Status bar</em>, and finally the <em>scroll bars</em> which are always visible.</p>
<p>Persistent up/down arrows and scroll bars are the right thing to do, usability-wise, and it is such a user-friendly design. The length of the ‘aqua blue’ bar immediately gives you an idea of how populated that folder you just opened is going to be. Further, if you need to rapidly scroll down, you just grab the bar with the mouse pointer and scroll.</p>
<p>In later Mac OS versions, scroll bars are set by default to appear only based on mouse/trackpad movement, which is a pity; many users probably don’t realise they can have scroll bars appear permanently, so they don’t have to time the mouseover action for the scroll bar to appear and then <em>hope</em> they’ll manage to grab it when they want to quickly scroll down a long list of elements.</p>
<p>I am once again reminded of that infamous quote by Alan Dye (Apple’s VP of Human Interface) from WWDC 2020, speaking of Big Sur’s UI redesign:&nbsp;<em>‌We’ve reduced visual complexity to keep the focus on users’ content. Buttons and controls appear when you need them, and they recede when you don’t.</em> I still believe this is not a good approach in general, and especially for essential elements like scroll bars, which should always be visible by default, because they are UI elements whose usefulness isn’t limited to when you use them or interact with them — they signal something even when not strictly needed. In the case of the scroll bars it’s a visual estimate of how many elements a folder contains, how long a list of items is, and more importantly <em>your current position</em> when scrolling.</p>
<p>Back to Finder windows, here’s an “Apple’s attention to detail” detail: notice that icon in the bottom left of the window? It is a subtle visual cue that tells you if Finder icons (items) are sorted, unsorted, or simply snapped to a grid. When opening windows from read-only volumes, the icon of a crossed-out pencil appears here, meaning that you can’t modify the enclosed items or write to that volume.</p>

<em>Window from a read-only volume</em></p>
<p>While I don’t find this UI detail to be crucial, it is certainly nice to have, and an example of those little things that contributed to make the Mac’s interface great. As I said above, it reflected a certain attention to detail and overall thoughtfulness I’ve seen progressively fade away in later Mac OS releases.</p>
<h2>A look back at a few system apps, with occasional UI comparisons between Snow Leopard and Big&nbsp;Sur</h2>
<h3>Safari</h3>
<p>5.1.10 was the last version of Safari running on Mac OS X 10.6.8. Here are a few things I still prefer over the current Safari:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=845%2C92" alt="" width="845" height="92" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?w=845 845w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=260%2C28 260w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=640%2C70 640w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-Blue-progress-bar.png?resize=768%2C84 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
<em>The blue progress bar</em></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=852%2C100" alt="" width="852" height="100" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?w=852 852w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=260%2C31 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=640%2C75 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-RSS-button.png?resize=768%2C90 768w" sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
<em>The RSS button (you could read RSS feeds with Safari)</em></p>
<p>Another detail I very much prefer in the older Safari over more recent versions of Safari is how the plus [+] button near the address bar works. Its placement makes its function rather unequivocal: <em>Add the current page to something</em>. As usual, tooltips are helpful:</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png?resize=562%2C92" alt="" width="562" height="92" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png?w=562 562w, https://i2.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-Plus-button-1.png?resize=260%2C43 260w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>But what if I want to add this page to my Reading List? No worries, when you actually press the [+], a thoughtfully-designed sheet comes down, and you can put the current page exactly where you want: in your Reading List, in the Top Sites, or in your Bookmarks.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-Plus-button-2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-Plus-button-2.png?resize=960%2C267" alt="" width="960" height="267" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-Plus-button-2.png?w=1005 1005w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-Plus-button-2.png?resize=260%2C72 260w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-Plus-button-2.png?resize=640%2C178 640w, https://i0.wp.com/morrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-Plus-button-2.png?resize=768%2C213 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The other plus button, to open a new browser tab, is placed in such an obvious spot that you know what it does without even waiting for the tooltip to appear:</p>

        <p>Intellij IDEA has been an amazing professional-grade IDE for the last 20 years. However, as computer programs evolve, so must the IDE keep pace to remain a useful tool.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>major IDE evolutions as I see:</p><p>2000s: using AST to represent text and building features around that. Intellij nailed this.</p><p>2010s: doing the same, but polyglot. Again Jetbrain's suite of IDEs adopted well in time.</p><p>2020s: support massive codebases across huge number of projects</p></div>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1337817841567899649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="what-s-changed">What's Changed?</h3><p>A typical organization in the 2020s has:</p><ol><li>Hundreds of microservices</li><li>Hundreds of git repos</li><li>Polyglot codebase</li><li>APIs defined with HTTP/JSON/GRPC, not just programming language interfaces</li><li>Runtime service inter-dependencies</li><li>Cloud service dependencies</li></ol><p>Let's go through how each of these could impact the design of the IDE of the future. I will be using Intellij for comparison since it's the most advanced IDE currently.</p><h3 id="big-code-is-the-new-big-data">Big Code is the new Big Data</h3><p>With huge amounts of code across hundreds or even thousands of repos, the IDE has to now deal with 'Big Code'. It's big not just due to the sheer lines of code. It's the fact that it's divided into microservices, each of which has a separate set of dependencies, which the IDE now has to separately index. This can exponentially increase the amount of code to index compared to a single large codebase without so many external dependencies like the Linux kernel.</p><p>All operations in the IDE must assume huge amounts of code across hundreds of repositories, not all of them might be checked out locally. So things like Refactoring, Find Usages, Call hierarchy, etc have to be re-architected to run as long-running operations over code that could be both local or remote and still give users a seamless experience.</p><h3 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3><p>Refactoring so far has really been a single repo feature. But what if the code you are refactoring is called by code in 100 other repos in your organization? What if those repos are not even checked out locally? The modern IDE needs to evolve beyond single repo operations. Maybe that rename refactoring now becomes a long-running operation that creates Pull Requests in various repos. This is not an easy problem to solve. Google even has a paper on this:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes and in large monorepos refactoring involves mapreduce operations <a href="https://t.co/yc92gX1qem">https://t.co/yc92gX1qem</a></p>— Nagesh Susarla (@nageshs) <a href="https://twitter.com/nageshs/status/1337843676324589568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>The complexity grows as API calls happen across services in various languages now and use HTTP/JSON or GRPC/ProtoBuf. Renaming a <code>struct</code> in one repo that gets serialized to JSON during an http api call might require renaming a similar <code>struct</code> in a whole different language that deserializes said JSON. This is way more complex than a simple Java function rename refactoring.</p><h3 id="version-control-ui">Version Control UI</h3><p>Version Control features in IDEs are really built around browsing/editing one git repo at a time. This simply doesn't work when your codebase is spread across hundreds of repos. The fundamental interface for the Git UI in Intellij (and other IDEs) needs to be rethought to deal with a large number of repos.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Git Log view in <a href="https://twitter.com/intellijidea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@intellijidea</a> is poorly designed with respect to multiple repositories. You need to use the mouse to get to this dropdown list in the view. Then you need to first *deselect* the current repo and select your new repo. <br>Dont think this was dogfooded by the devs. <a href="https://t.co/lZ0YHdrUth">pic.twitter.com/lZ0YHdrUth</a></p>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1349137311619981312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><h3 id="rethinking-the-project-model">Rethinking the 'Project' model</h3><p>Currently, an <a href="http://astradot.com/">Astradot</a> engineer has to check out a git repo, eg <a href="https://github.com/astradot/kafka-schema-sync">https://github.com/astradot/kafka-schema-sync</a>, open the IDE, point to it, which will create an Intellij 'project' for the repo or a 'module' for an existing project. This is backward. The IDE should ask for the Github org eg, <a href="http://github.com/org">github.com/astradot</a> and it should create a single project that contains all the repo as modules. It should then manage lazy-loading/lazy-checkout or whatever is needed to give me a seamless experience browsing the code of my entire org.</p><h3 id="-run-button">'Run' button</h3><p>The 'Run' button will need to have more intelligence than simply running your app. In a microservice world, your service might depend upon an 'auth' service which might require a Postgres database and Redis instance initialized to some state. The services may rely on k8s service names to communicate, thus requiring running inside k8s. The IDE will need to be aware of the environment where you want to run your services and initialize the dependencies appropriately when you hit the 'Run' button.</p><p>The traditional debugger though is not going anywhere anytime soon. Take that from a guy who wrote a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpfmKIxusZY">time-traveling one</a>, once upon a time. Though IDEs could take a page from APMs and benefit from showing a distributed trace in addition to breakpoint-based debugging.</p><h3 id="what-s-not-the-future">What's not the future</h3><p>Silicon Valley has been obsessed with making 'IDE in the Cloud' happen for the last decade. Every year a new set of cloud IDE startups is funded while the old ones die off. None of the problems they are solving help professional engineers.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Annual IDE startup bingo card:</p><p>- Downgrade 'IDE' part from Intellij to VSCode but hey, it opens in browser!</p><p>- See every keystroke of other engineers - 'Collaboration/Live coding'</p><p>- Code runs in tiny ec2 instance with horsepower of 90s laptop instead of your 12 core AMD pc</p></div>— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) <a href="https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1363206351128723457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>From an <a href="http://astradot.com/">Astradot</a> engineer's perspective:</p><ul><li>Downloading and Installing Intellij is a non-issue</li><li>We have scripts to setup your workstation environment within minutes with all the needed compilers, tooling, etc.</li><li>We never need to see each other live code. That would be annoying/intruding on the other engineer's privacy.</li><li>Workstations are powerful enough that they can run the entire <a href="http://astradot.com/">Astradot</a> locally.</li></ul><p>We would love to buy all our engineers 64 core Threadrippers w 128Gb ram if the IDE could make use of it.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The IDE of the future is very different from what Intellij is today, both in terms of its architecture and UI. It requires solving some hard computer science problems. Jetbrains seems more focused on making just evolutionary changes to its IDEs to keep it ahead of VS Code. This is an opportunity for a new startup to rise.</p>

				<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/l99.jpg" alt="Robot"></p>
<p>At the time of writing this article, I’ve been living without social media for 3 years and without a smartphone for 2 years. Everything started as an experiment motivated by my privacy concerns. I ended up living like that for an entire different reason: peace of mind. You can find a lot of people on internet that have tried this experiment, from a couple of days to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0RVWU_nROk">entire month</a>. However I discovered that the brain dependencies created by social media and smartphones take a lot longer to go away (30 days for me). You can’t really see the effects it has on your life unless you try this kind of experiment for a long time, because you will be stuck in the withdrawal phase that makes you crave dopamine.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, I do not live in a cave where I spend my time coding without any social life, sorry guys ;) I did this experiment while having a busy professional and personal life: I traveled around the world, moved to a new city without knowing anyone, ran <a href="https://www.duple.io/">my own software startup</a>, met new people and made new friends, etc… So it is possible to live your life the same way, or even better, without a smartphone or social media.</p>
<p>I will share with you my experience leaving social media and my smartphone, the tools I replaced them with, some tips and tricks, people’s reactions to my experiment, as well as some funny anecdotes.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start-with-why">Let’s Start With Why</h2>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>The original motivation behind this experiment was privacy. I’m a professional hacker, the things I can do are scary and I’m far from being the only one with these skills. <strong>Smartphones are a dream come true for people like me, little spy devices that are 24/7 on you, remotely accessible from anywhere around the world</strong>. Throw social media into the equation, and you can get inside the head of anybody, and make them do whatever you want. Yes, you should be scared. And that’s even without mentioning all the other <a href="https://lithub.com/what-does-privacy-really-mean-under-surveillance-capitalism/">privacy</a> and <a href="https://the.ink/p/we-can-have-democracy-or-we-can-have">freedom</a> issues that come with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">social media</a> and <a href="https://nrkbeta.no/2020/12/03/my-phone-was-spying-on-me-so-i-tracked-down-the-surveillants/">smartphones</a>.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
<p>Another reason, which is less dark, was curiosity. I like to experiment and try new things in my life. I was curious about the idea of living without a smartphone and social media especially in a world more connected than ever. And if I didn’t like the experiment, I could always go back to <a href="https://www.meta-nomad.net/avoiding-the-global-lobotomy/">zombieland</a>.</p>
<h3 id="planned-obsolescence">Planned Obsolescence</h3>
<p>The cherry on top was to stop paying each year for a new smartphone, that does nothing more than the previous one, just because the providers decided to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">sabotage old models</a> so they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batterygate">stop working</a>.</p>
<h3 id="peace-of-mind">Peace of mind</h3>
<p>This is for me the most important reason (even though I discovered it afterwards). The positive effects on your mind, being free from social media and smartphones, are incredible. More on it later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Technology has solved old economics problems by giving us new psychological problems.”<br>
Mark Manson, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 I deleted my accounts from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. No coming back, no temptation to reactivate them later on. I kept LinkedIn on standby for professional use although it came close to being deleted as well. WhatsApp got replaced by <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> because Facebook bought them, plus <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/">they’re not really big fan s of privacy</a>.</p>
<p>During that year I kept my smartphone, as I wanted to do the experiment gradually. This decision allowed me to discover something quite counter intuitive about social media and smartphones (more on it later).</p>
<p>From that point on I was reachable by SMS, call, email and Signal. I wasn’t ready for what happened next. Fasten your seatbelts.</p>
<h3 id="people-thought-i-was-dead">People Thought I Was Dead</h3>
<p>The first reaction people had was to think something bad had happened to me, some of them even thought I was dead. Then something socially curious happened: everybody started speaking to each other on Facebook and WhatsApp to try to figure out what was wrong. Some of them even contacted my family multiple times. They all had my phone number, email address and other ways of contacting me. <strong>However, none of them did</strong>. It was like I had exited the matrix, and was living in another reality.</p>
<h3 id="trustworthiness">Trustworthiness</h3>
<p>I was told that I couldn’t be trusted since people can’t check online what I’m doing when I’m not around.</p>
<p>Yeah, you read that right.</p>
<p><strong>Society has been brainwashed to believe that privacy is something criminal. Sorry to disappoint, but privacy is a basic fundament of freedom and democracy. That’s why the voting system is anonymous</strong> [1]. When people tell you “<a href="https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide">If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear</a>”, what they really mean is “democracy is overrated, get over it”.</p>
<p><em>[1] Privacy: you know who I am but not what I do. Anonymity: You know what I do but not who I am. The voting system uses both, privacy when you go vote, anonymity when they count the results.</em></p>
<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<p>This was for me the biggest problem. <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">Getting people out of WhatsApp</a> if they wanted to talk to me created a lot of friction. Some of them even stopped texting me because they had to open another app on their phone in order to write to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you also read that right.</p>
<p>I don’t miss WhatsApp, nor do I miss its endless group talks without anything useful. If you leave one of these groups people look at you as if you did something wrong. In the end I still had access to all the event’s information I needed despite them being organized on WhatsApp. In regards to this, not having the app didn’t change my life much.</p>
<p>A trick I’ve developed, when giving my contact info to new people, is to enter my phone number on their smartphone myself, and install Signal for them. This removed a lot of friction. I would then explain my experiment to them and tell them I can only be contacted via this app. I’ve always had a positive reaction. Everybody’s been curious and asking a lot of questions.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-nothing-happened">And Then Nothing Happened</h3>
<p>During the first weeks without social media, I felt off. As if I was missing out on something big that was happening. Like everybody was having fun except me. Once the <a href="https://joshcsimmons.com/quit-social-media/">withdrawal phase</a> went away, I realized that my life hadn’t changed that much. I was still doing the same things, talking to the same people, going to the same parties, etc… It was just more quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>I was no longer bombarded with pictures of everybody trying to fake a life they’re not living for the sole purpose of impressing someone else: <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel">my life had just upgraded</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In the end, after everybody got over their initial shock and calmed down, it became normal for them to contact me using Signal, and life went on as usual.</p>
<h2 id="round-2-goodbye-smartphone">Round 2: Goodbye Smartphone</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/l99-2.jpg" alt="Phone"></p>
<p>Unlike social media, smartphones are a lot harder to get rid off. They handle many more things than just simply communicating with people.  I work all day long with a computer, most of what the smartphone was doing could be handled by my laptop. For the rest, I narrowed down my bare essential to Music, Pictures, GPS navigation and of course GSM calls.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>
<p>You could solve these problems quite easily using multiple devices, however I wanted to be smart about it and not walk around with a luggage just to carry around all this stuff. After doing some research I figured out the perfect combination and I was even able to reduce the amount of things I had in my pockets.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <div><p>The venture capital industry was built on the premise that both capital and high quality companies are scarce. For most of the history of the industry, this has been true. I remember sitting at demo day in 2011 and marveling at the fact that the combined capital of all the VCs in the room was less than that controlled by the hedge fund at which I had worked. But the model is wrong. Venture capital is abundant, and that fact should fundamentally change how founders fundraise.<br></p><p>This scarcity model has shaped the structure of startups and VCs - most of what an early stage startup does is designed to convince a VC to invest. Companies treat VCs as a limited resource that is both hard to access and hard to convince. Investors do their best to perpetuate this idea because it allows them to retain control of the pitch and fund dynamic.[1]</p><p>Something interesting happens, though, whenever a company has a signifier of quality - a YC demo day slot, a high quality angel, pedigreed founders, or, even better, strong growth. In these cases, there are investor feeding frenzies, leading to oversubscribed rounds, ever climbing prices, and investors willing to accept ownership targets they - until recently - would have termed unacceptable.</p><p>To be sure, there have always been bidding wars in private equity (of which venture is a subset), but these bidding wars are so frequent now as to be approaching the norm. If capital was actually scarce, this wouldn’t happen, there wouldn’t be enough money to create so many bidding wars.[2]</p><p>Bidding wars aren’t the only evidence of capital abundance. The VCs are changing their businesses because of this abundance, whether or not they admit the reason. The evidence is in the new funds that seem to launch on a daily basis, the multi-billion dollar growth funds that have become increasingly common, and the ownership targets at various rounds that continue to drop.</p><p>At the same time that capital has become more abundant, founders have become smarter about fundraising. There are now a huge number of blogs, classes, essays, guides, and advisers ready to help founders navigate the previously opaque world of fundraising. As a result, founders can approach each funding event with a clear plan of how to run a process. Running an orderly process further increases the chances that a company will see competitive bids.</p><p>As a thought experiment, assume that the abundance model is here to stay. It is also safe to assume that founders will not suddenly forget their newfound knowledge about process. I think this should encourage founders to think about changing fundraising in a few major ways:</p><ol>
<li><p>Founders should approach every fundraising as an auction. This is what each process already is, but the auction is inefficient. There’s lots of language and pseudo-moral arguments about why this is bad, but most of those fall apart if capital is abundant.</p></li>
<li><p>Founders should expand their funnels beyond the traditional VCs. These VCs hold a marketing and branding advantage, much of which is built around the signal to later rounds. If, however, each round is an auction, this benefit evaporates. YC’s demo day proved this funnel expansion works at seed, and there’s no logical reason it should fail at later rounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Once a founder has the information produced by this process, she can decide whether to minimize dilution, maximize price, or optimize around the partner. The answer will change based on the situation, but having access to the choice is important.</p></li>
</ol><p>Founders are hesitant to run this model because they fear that running an auction will create a negative quality signal. Investors encourage this belief because it allows them to keep deal flow proprietary. This is flawed logic. The quality of a company can’t be determined by the investors to whom that company talks when raising money. The quality of a company is determined by whether or not the company is good, and good companies should take advantage of abundant capital markets.[3]</p><p><i>Thanks to Adora Cheung, Janelle Tam, Ilya Sukhar, and Nabeel Hyatt for helping me think this through, even though our conclusions might differ.<br></i></p><p>__</p><p>[1] Perhaps more importantly to the investors’ business model is that this dynamic creates a reason for the existence of VCs.

	<h2>Let's build a Complementary Color Scheme!</h2>

	<p>This is the color wheel, consider this the documentation for using color. <br> Notice that the degrees on the color wheel correspond to colors.</p>

	<h2>Pick a color <span> hsl($hue, $saturation, $lightness)</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		<p>Pick any color by selecting its hue (0-360) on the color wheel at full saturation (100%) and at half lightness (50%) - this way you start with the 'most colorful color' you can get.</p>
		<p>This is what your website will look like if you set every element to this one color. Notice how you can't tell one item from another. Color is information.</p>

		<div>
			<p>Why pick a fully saturated color, but only half lightness?</p>
			<p>Ever mix up a bunch of colors only to end up with a gray blob? In the real world, you can't mix a color to be more saturated - you only "lose" color information as you mix. So, the practice is to start with the most saturated colors at their most chromatic so you can still have a full range of mixing opportunities.</p>

	<h2>Generate Complementary Color<span>complement( );</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		<p>Generate your second color without having to guess what will work. Thanks to science and wavelengths, we know that this works. The opposition of these two colors stimulate your photoreceptor cells in a good way!</p>
		<p>Finally! A different color - now hue separates elements from each other and a layout can be seen.</p>

		<p>The complement to any color is always 180 degrees across on the other side of the color wheel. If you've ever wondered why it's the color wheel instead of a color line, this is part of that answer. Remember that the color wheel is our visual documentation for color relationships. <br> Fun fact, if you mix complementary colors, they'll cancel each other out and you'll end up with a neutral gray.</p>

				<p>Our eyes may be legacy systems, but they are really good at spotting patterns, especially things that look like they don't belong in a set.</p>
				<p>This mixing method is another way we can simulate lighting and color found in nature. It's a bit more complicated, but my favorite way of explaining it is this: Everything outside has some "yellow" mixed in from the sunshine during the day. Same thing happens when everyone and everything looks bad in photos taken under the glow of green flourescent lights - there is green added to all of the colors you're looking at, including adding a green glow to your skin if you're standing under the flourescent light yourself. Whether it looks good or bad, this color (light) mixing creates a visual harmony. We don't really notice it when it's there, but we really notice its absence.</p>
				<p>When you're painting, you want to simulate similar lighting conditions for a scene, and that effect is accomplished mixing a bit of one color into the other. Mixing different ratios of the same colors will usually generate a matching color palette.</p>
				<p>How do I decide what to do? Thanks to art school and science, I know that cool colors have lower luminosity than warm colors, and will dominate in mixes, with yellow being the lightest color. For example, a touch of blue will really affect yellow, whereas you can add a lot of yellow to blue before it is affected. So, here is this decision making in function form - I am weighing different colors differently when mixing.</p>

	<h2>Create Neutrals<span>mix-neutral( ); lighten( ); darken( );</span></h2>
	<div>
		
		
		
		<p>Let your chosen color pop (in other words, don't exhaust your eyes by making them process non-stop intense chromatic colors!) by surrounding it with neutrals. Desaturate the painter way: by mixing complementary colors! Then, vary that neutral's lightness to create a highlight and a shadow.</p>
		<p>Making the complementary color neutrals will help the 'call to action' color you selected stand out - notice how much the button in the top right "pops" all of a sudden. Make things "pop" by making other things around them not pop.</p>

		<p>We can do the same for our primary color too. More neutrals to work with.</p>
		<p>Doesn't it seem like we went too far with this whole making things neutral? Now, nothing "pops"! But, on the plus side, none of this seems to be irritating any eyeballs, either. Remember that our eyes don't like to handle seeing everything our computers are capable of rendering.</p>

			<p>The colors are way too intense at their full saturation for our eyes to handle. If all the colors are bright, none of the colors are bright.</p>
			<p>I picked my starting color for a reason -  I want that to be the heart of my design! That means the complementary color should support the chosen color, and we do that by mixing neutrals. Our eyes don't really handle saturated colors very well next to other saturated colors. Our eyes get confused at the edges - is it this color or the other one? Ahh both! We end up seeing optical illusions. Just give your eyes a break between super strong saturated colors with neutrals so they don't stress out about that much visual information. At the very minimum a rule of thumb is that your viewport should have 33% neutral space (white, desaturated, or black colors) so your poor eyes can have a break and process the information right. Otherwise you get eye strain!</p>

	<h2>Why not just desaturate?<span>mix-neutral( ); lighten( ); darken( );</span></h2>
		<p>You totally can! Desaturate does a great job. But, I think not only is it important to understand what "desaturate" means. How would you desaturate a real color in the real world? Remember, you want "ugly" colors for your neutrals! You want to create bland and forgettable colors that recede into the background. These ugly duckling colors are how you get those other call to actions and buttons "pop"!</p>

      <p>Dashboards have long been the much maligned visualization vehicle of choice for decision-making in commercial and governmental situations.  While the visualization research community has concentrated much of its effort on visual analytics, the commercial success and widespread use of dashboards begs more attention.  Critically, dashboards are becoming many peoples’ direct connection to “big data” sources, enabling data democratization and wider access to data.</p>

<p>In this paper, we explore the genre of dashboards through a two-prong approach.  We survey the existing literature in business, marketing, and related fields to capture the relevant factors to consider when designing appropriate dashboards and their tools for consumption by different parties, all of which have differing levels of visualization literacy, data literacy, and decision agency.  We also collect examples of dashboard designs based on the dimensions derived from our literature search, and identify different clusters of dashboard designs with similar analysis goals, audiences, and decision support.</p>

<p>We call ourselves the “dashboard conspiracy:” a truly diverse collection of authors across Tableau Research, Microsoft Research, and Simon Fraiser University.</p>

<p><em>Summary: JWCC is a minimal extension to the widely used JSON file format with
(1) optional commas after the final element of arrays and objects and (2) C/C++
style comments. These two features make it more suitable for human-editable
configuration files, without adding so many features that it’s incompatible
with numerous other (deliberate and accidental) existing JSON extensions.</em></p>

<h2 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h2>

<p>The Peter Principle is the half-joking, half-serious observation that people
get promoted to their level of incompetence, because being competent at level
<code>N</code> leads to being promoted to level <code>N+1</code>.</p>

<p>My colleague Simon Morris made a similar observation about software complexity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Software has a Peter Principle. If a piece of code is comprehensible, someone
will extend it, so they can apply it to their own problem. If it’s
incomprehensible, they’ll write their own code instead. Code tends to be
extended to its level of incomprehensibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-many-json-extensions">The Many JSON Extensions</h3>

<p>There’s a similar story with file formats. If they’re comprehensible, they’ll
get extended. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is this article’s example. The
<a href="https://json.org/">original specification</a> fits on a single page, either as
text or diagrams. The file format is simple and ubiquitous. Therefore, there
are many extensions - supersets of JSON. Here’s just a few (including two
slightly different extensions both called “JSONC”):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://json5.org/">JSON5</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://komkom.github.io/">JSONC</a> #1</li>
  <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments">JSONC</a> #2</li>
  <li><a href="https://hjson.github.io/">HJSON</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md">HOCON</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Suprisingly, <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a> is also a superset of JSON. Not just
conceptually, but also in the sense that valid JSON files are also valid YAML
files (although there’s some divergence about whether duplicate keys are
legitimate). As a bonus, if you use YAML, then to paraphrase <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">Jamie
Zawinski</a>: now you have <a href="https://noyaml.com/">NO
problems</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wandering-off-the-specification">Wandering Off the Specification</h3>

<p>There are also informal supersets-of-JSON in widespread use, sometimes more by
accident than by design. The Chromium web browser’s <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:base/json/json_reader.h;l=27;drc=d0919138b7951c1a154cf802a68aad7904b6f4c9">JSON parser goes
off-spec</a>
in a number of ways. The timeline could have been:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some developer long ago (perhaps in a yak-shaving hurry) wrote or
copy/pasted some parsing code that was accidentally too lenient, allowing a
superset-of-JSON. Perhaps they re-used existing code that handled C-style
string escapes, like the <code>"\n"</code> in <code>"line\nbreak"</code>, without realizing that
it also unescaped <code>"\v"</code>, valid in a C string but not a JSON string.</li>
  <li>People use the software. They write first-party and third-party JSON for it.
Some of it is actually malformed (e.g. they have <code>"\v"</code> inside strings) but
tests (manual and automatic) usually check that new features work, not that
all the slightly-incorrect things are rejected. Nobody notices at the time.</li>
  <li>Years pass. <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a> slowly kicks in. We
can no longer tighten this custom JSON parser implementation to follow the
spec more strictly because too many things (in unknown places) will break.</li>
</ol>

<p>This also affects our ability to replace one JSON library with another. For
example, we might want to switch from a C++-based JSON parser to a Rust-based
one, because of its security benefits. If the upstream Rust library chooses to
follow the spec diligently (which is a perfectly reasonable position) then it
would ‘break’ our apps that have inadvertently relied on the previous
looser-than-the-spec implementation.</p>

<p>We could carry local patches, but that isn’t free. Upstream fuzz-testing
infrastructure only exercises the unmodified library, not our patched flavor.
Future upstream changes may also invalidate the downstream patch, possibly in
subtle ways. An upstream “this new unsafe block is OK because it’s a private
implementation detail and nothing in this crate does X” comment might not be
aware that our out-of-tree patch does X to its internals.</p>

<h3 id="quirks">Quirks</h3>

<p>The Wuffs library approach is to expose
<a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/doc/note/quirks.md">quirks</a>: runtime
configuration options to go off-spec in various ways so that Wuffs’
implementation can be a drop-in replacement for other implementations, without
the need for downstream patches.</p>

<p>Wuffs has <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/std/json/decode_quirks.wuffs">20 JSON
quirks</a>
so far. As always, there are trade-offs. They’re not free (in terms of
maintenance cost) and have super-linear complexity: that file’s comments also
has 12 call-outs to the subtleties of combining two particular quirks.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the emergent complexity when combining two simple-sounding
JSON extensions. The first one adds C++-style <code>/* slash-star block comments */</code>
and <code>// double-slash line comments</code>. The second one packs multiple top-level
values in a single stream, separated by line breaks.</p>

<p>That second extension - by itself and when holding minified, whitespace-free
‘vanilla’ (non-extended) JSON - plays well with Unix’s traditional
line-oriented tools. It is sometimes known as Line-Delimited JSON
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON">LDJSON</a>),
Newline-Delimited JSON (<a href="http://ndjson.org/">NDJSON</a>) and JSON Lines
(<a href="http://jsonlines.org/">JSONL</a>). But “one value per line” tools’ assumptions
can break if slash-star comments can also contain blank lines.</p>

<p>Here’s another question (let’s call it the ‘end of comment’ question). Is the
<code>'\n'</code> at the end of of a <code>// double-slash line comment</code> actually part of the
comment? At first, this sounds merely philosophical. Comments are ignored and,
in ‘vanilla’ JSON, all whitespace is ignored, so why the distinction?</p>

<p>The ‘right’ answer to that ‘end of comment’ question isn’t obvious, but it can
affect whether a line comment at the end of a multi-value stream should end in
1 or 2 <code>'\n'</code> bytes. Ideally the answer should be self-consistent with whether
a line comment at the end of file must end with the <code>'\n'</code> or whether the
implicit EOF (end-of-file) alone suffices. See also the <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">“Parsing JSON is a
Minefield”</a> and <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/12/28/">“Unintuitive JSON
Parsing”</a> articles for how subtle a
‘simple’ format like JSON can be.</p>

<p>Wuffs makes one particular choice for that ‘end of comment’ question. Its
particular choice probably isn’t that important, more that it made a concious
and documented choice.</p>

<h3 id="clarity-not-terseness">Clarity, not Terseness</h3>

<p>Some general advice, when designing a new file format or extending an existing
one, is keep some room for future extensions. For example, allowing unquoted
strings (writing <code>foo</code> instead of <code>"foo"</code>), is certainly convenient, but
re-defining <code>undefined</code> or <code>datetime</code> without quotes, from invalid JSON syntax
to valid some-extension-of-JSON strings, rules out a future extension adding
new ‘keywords’.</p>

<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a> is binary at the wire format level (unlike textual
JSON) but naturally extends JSON at the object model level. It also has an
<code>undefined</code> concept separate from <code>null</code>, and <code>undefined</code> can be a map key. We
couldn’t do the ‘obvious’ CBOR-to-some-extended-JSON conversion if <code>undefined</code>,
without quotes, was already repurposed to mean a string.</p>

<p>I find it suprising that, <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#unquoted-strings">in
HOCON</a>,
“<code>truefoo</code> parses as the boolean token <code>true</code> followed by the unquoted string
<code>foo</code>. However, <code>footrue</code> parses as the unquoted string <code>footrue</code>”.</p>

<p>It can also be helpful for a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=return.flase+extension%3Apy">typo like
<code>flase</code></a> to be picked
up early as a syntax error (without needing schemas or type checking) instead
of silently accepted (as a string, not a bool). This can otherwise be
especially dangerous if further processed in a weakly-typed programming
language where any non-empty string is ‘truthy’.</p>

<p><code>[a b c]</code> is invalid ‘vanilla’ JSON syntax, but in the various extended-JSON
variants, is it a list with three 1-byte strings or one 5-byte string? Or is it
one 3-byte string because three 1-byte strings are implicitly
whitespace-delimited and also then implicitly concatenated? Any particular
answer can be consistent in its own world, but different JSON extensions make
different choices. This can be confusing when software grows large enough (or
gains enough transitive dependencies) to have to speak multiple JSON
extensions.</p>

<p>These days, when I’m programming in C/C++ or Go, I often add unnecessary
parentheses in expressions like <code>(a * b) + c</code>. Even though they’re redundant
because of well-defined operator precedence rules, different programming
languages have different precedence rules and getting the precedence wrong can
lead to <a href="https://github.com/jbangert/nail/issues/7">hard-to-spot bugs</a>. The
Wuffs language actually <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/3d6c609dc12de3c81e1b8079ceecf96370b086a2/doc/wuffs-the-language.md#operators">rejects a bare <code>a * b +
c</code></a>
and you have to parenthesize the multiplication or the addition.</p>

<p>Similarly, for JSON-like documents, I prefer the clarity of either <code>["a", "b",
"c"]</code> or <code>["a b c"]</code>, even if it means a little extra typing. Reading is more
important than writing for code and configuration, especially when multiple
people or long periods of time are involved.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-jwcc">Introducing JWCC</h2>

<p>Having said all of that, here is yet another superset-of-JSON, called JWCC
(JSON With Commas and Comments). It is a minimal extension. As its name
suggests, there are only two new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Commas” lets you optionally have a comma after the final element of an array
or an object: <code>[1,2,3,]</code>. When you format one element per line, it’s easier
to insert and remove elements (and eyeball the diffs) when you don’t have to
fiddle with any commas (or lack of commas) on adjacent but otherwise
unrelated lines.</li>
  <li>“Comments” lets you have C++-style <code>/* slash-star block comments */</code> and <code>//
double-slash line comments</code>, anywhere where ‘vanilla’ JSON allows whitespace.
Line comments must end with a <code>'\n'</code> byte, even at the end of the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, while every JSON file is valid JWCC, this is a new file format. It
just happens to be very familiar if you (or your software) already speak JSON.

JSON</a>
but people keep putting them back in. If we’re going to have comment-enriched
JSON (e.g. for human-editable configuration files), we might as well have a
standard one. Cue <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD #927 “Standards”</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>Ethereum isn’t fun anymore. There I said it.</strong> And although, the last
time I developed an app using it has been more than a year ago, I stand by
my word. <strong>Developing dapps on Ethereum has become annoying</strong>.  Here’s why:</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/pedro.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="I-used-Ethereum-before-it-was-cool">I used Ethereum before it was cool.</h2>
<p>I know; it’s such a hipster statement. But it’s true. Ethereum has stopped
being edgy. It has transitioned out of its niche to build a world computer.
Its community has become huge, and I stopped knowing most faces. Where there
was a feeling of revolution and new beginnings, now there are people in suits
talking corporate. Within just a few years, it went from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DaddyDeFi/DaiDaddy">DAI
daddys</a> and only <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.molochdao.com/">half-ironic satanist
cults</a> to lending, insurance, and trade protocols.</p>
<p>“What’s Ethereum’s killer app?” we asked ourselves not long ago.  Now we know.
It’s the world’s best publicly-accessible settlement platform for financial
transactions.  In a way, that’s exciting. The markets think so too. But for
anyone else that worked with Ethereum but outside of financial applications,
it’s somewhat of a letdown.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/homer.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-do-fellow-Ethereans">How do you do, fellow Ethereans?</h2>
<p>I think it must have been around the time of the last big crypto bubble
when Monero enthusiasts called for “Making Monero cheap again.”</p>
<p>Monero, being the anonymous digital currency that had indeed just legit use
cases apart from the occasional rumors that entangled it in drug
trafficking, had suddenly become too expensive for everyday use. Realizing
the glaring threat of becoming too valuable, its core developers went on to
fix the problem by campaigning at CoinDesk’s yearly industry gathering
Consensus.</p>
<p>They announced the “Monero Enterprise Alliance.” An inside joke,
supposed to piss off other projects that had started to take themselves too
seriously. Being slightly confused that day myself, I now can’t recall if
the effort had ever been successful. But in any case, I can’t recommend
buying Monero. It’s useless.</p>
<h2 id="Gas-prices-are-too-damn-high">Gas prices are too damn high!</h2>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/deepfried_high_rents.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a phase in my short career as an Ethereum developer where I looked at
Etherscan’s “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified">Verified Contracts</a>” page
all day long to find vulnerabilities in newly uploaded contracts. “My name’s Tim
and I’m an etherholic!”</p>
<p>It was addictive. I ended up calling a few of those contracts, failing to cause
any havoc, sadly. But it was so much fun! Back when transaction fees were still
affordable on Ethereum, building projects was great. We started up Ganache and
our favorite text editor (vim).  The only choice we had was Solidity. And off
we went.</p>
<p>Now, building Ethereum applications has become painful. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/08/web3/">web3 is a stupid
idea</a>. Layer 2 isn’t ready. Neither
is Eth 2.0. And there are still <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2019/02/28/poa/">many reasons to NOT ship to a Proof of
Authority network</a>. Finally, gas
prices are too damn high!</p>
<p>How do we move on from here?</p>
<h2 id="I-need-a-hero">I need a hero.</h2>
<p><strong>I need a hero, and by that, I mean that I need a usable methodology for
building scaleable decentralized apps.</strong> Yes, you’ve heard that right. We don’t
need more “Ethereum killers” that can do 10x more tx/s than Ethereum.  Those
are useless.</p>
<p>Instead, we need an approach for the average Joe developer to create their idea
within the Ethereum ecosystem without the need for hardcore unproven
technologies. I know, you Vitalik will say: “Oh, it’s not a problem, we can has
‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/03/21/garbled.html">Garbled Circuits</a>’ and
zkrollups.” But I’m telling you that no sane Joe will touch that shit without a
serious cryptographic specialist by their side.</p>
<p>We want what we stayed for initially: Good ol smart contracts. But right now,
they’re too damn expensive to innovate.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The most popular products don’t become mass popular overnight. It’s a process. Usually, their popularity is uneven, they are unknown in some niches, but very popular in other niches.</p><p>When you start a product, sometimes you know the niche already and can easily define target customers. However, in many cases, you just don’t and try to find the niche and this miraculous niche-market-fit. </p><p>One of the most common mistakes is to ignore niches and just try to attract all kinds of customers. It’s essential to find 1-2 ponds to start from and then expand to the other, larger, and more promising lakes and oceans 🚰 → 🛁 → 🌊.</p><p>Here are a couple, maybe surprising examples, that demonstrate how popular products took off. </p><h4>Electrical telegraph (1837)</h4><p>Its adoption was not easy, since it was not clear what are the benefits for commercial institutions. Stockbrokers and reporters got the benefits first. They understood that fast information transition increases efficiency and helps to get an edge. In a short term, all major news agencies and major stock markets were connected to the telegraph. </p><h4>Telephone (1876)</h4><p>Telephones were adopted by police departments and fire stations. Fast reaction to crime reports and fires was great, but the telegraph was not enough. You have to have two-ways communication to get some details that the sender maybe is not expecting to report initially. </p><h4>Phonograph (1877)</h4><p>Try to guess the first niche market for the phonograph. Rich music lovers? Nope. First phonographs were coin-machines in bars. Throw a nickel and enjoy Stephen Foster ballads.</p><h4>Car (1886)</h4><p>Cars are almost among the lucky exception to the niche rule. However, there was still one group of people in the USA that moved from horses to cars enormously fast — farmers. Cars just expanded the borders of farmers’ social life and business activities. Suddenly you can buy goods, not from a local dealer, but a dealer in a remote town (much cheaper). Suddenly you can visit a town and watch a movie. These benefits were not important for the urban population, for they were life-changers for the rural population. Nevertheless, cars were adopted in cities quite fast as well.</p><blockquote><p>In addition, the car delivered you to the door and was faster than a horse-and-buggy, thus allowing longer trips in shorter time. Farmers had traditionally felt guilty about taking such trips, even when the time was available. </p></blockquote><h4>Radio (1895)</h4><p>Radio was immediately adopted by the British Royal Navy, they thought that radio can speed up communication between ships and were right. Fun fact: in 1912 Titanic sent CQD (distress signal), however, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/why-titanic-first-call-help-not-sos-signal">radio receiver was turned off on the closest ship</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the closest ship, Californian, didn’t receive Titanic’s distress calls at all.

Yes, you can, but this is just hard. The most problematic part is marketing. Who are your ideal customers? How to reach them? How to target your message? <strong>Product is the message</strong>, so without proper marketing startup success chances are low. </p><h4>My experience</h4><p>In Fibery we did our first release in April 2020 as a general work management tool. We were not sure in what types of companies it will work better and what use cases will be more valuable. In just a month it became clear that we had all kinds of leads from all kinds of companies. Leads demanded all kinds of improvements that just didn’t form a sane strategy. </p><p>We quickly <a href="https://fibery.io/blog/chronicles-21/">decided to select a single niche and focus on it</a>. The niche we choose was product companies from 20 to 200 people. And it made everything much simpler. Finally, we can quite accurately say what features are important and what features are not so important, what is our value proposition, who is our ideal lead (Product Ops or CPO). It took us 9 months to prepare the <a href="https://fibery.io/product-management">second release</a>, but in this niche Fibery can fly much better, I believe. </p><p>OK, niche strategy looks convincing, but how to find the niche? We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway’s law</a>, and it’s just partially a joke. We’ve reviewed a couple of alternatives and selected one we knew best and were confident that our product will provide a significant value boost. There were other alternatives, like education space or digital agencies space, but our knowledge here was not deep enough. It means we should rely on some domain experts, etc. It’s not a huge problem, but we also did not feel that these niches are better.</p><p>A startup should be an experimentation facility that hypothesizes, executes, and measures the results. The faster you can do it, the faster you find your niche. Why it took us 9 months to make this niche release? In fact we spend time to create a niche-probing framework. Now we can asseble solutions for various niches in 1-2 weeks and check initial response in 1-2 months. If the first niche will not be successful, we at least have a decent experimentation framework 🧬.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the vulnerability reporting process that took place after Sakura Samurai had breached the Indian Government</p><p>Reading time: 6 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>Sakura Samurai knew that the Indian Government operated an RVDP (Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program). <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> put a list together of initial assets in scope for Sakura Samurai to legally test. <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> reported that he had found sensitive data and was able to breach police assets. <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> was working in the enumeration processes with his friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001" title="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001">Zultan Holder</a> [not an active Sakura Samurai member] and identified a slew of various attack vectors, immediately resulting in the exposure of many pairs of credentials for databases and other pertinent applications.</p>
<p>The team was informed of the initial enumeration results as they continued to work on the list of assets within scope, while also further jumping into the research and began performing analysis on the sensitive data, identifying additional vectors of attack, exposed PII, and even more credentials.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai team members included <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a>, and<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking"> John Jackson</a></p>
<p>In total, the following vulnerabilities were identified, in no specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 Separate Instances of Exposed Credential Pairs (Servers, Important Applications, etc)</li>
<li>3 Instances of Sensitive File Disclosure</li>
<li>5 Exposed private-key pairs for servers</li>
<li>13K+ PII Records [and those are only the records that we were inadvertently exposed to]</li>
<li>Dozens of Exposed Sensitive Police Reports</li>
<li>Session Hijacking Chained via Multiple Vulnerabilities, resulting in the compromise of extremely sensitive government systems</li>
<li>Remote Code Execution on a sensitive financial server; a server that contained large backups of Financial Records</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, it is important to note that so many Critical findings had been identified during our testing that we cannot possibly include all of the vulnerabilities without making this writeup unnecessarily heavy. Therefore, we have opted to include small snippets of repetitive findings in this section. Many variations of application and server credentials also were obtained but the point has already been made.</p>
<p><strong>Exposed Database Credentials</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/db-creds.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Private SSH Keys</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/priv-ssh.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive File Exposure</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sens-file-exp.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Exposed PHP Mailer Credentials</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/mailer.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> identified an application that resulted in a vulnerability that allowed him to access Sensitive Police Records, containing PII of individuals listed on the report. In addition, sample forensic reports and forensic tooling that is used by the police department was identified by Willis. The exposure of citizen’s sensitive information, some being victims, is a sensitive subject within itself and highly alarming.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police2.png" alt=""><br>
Shortly after, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> found a vulnerability that resulted in the exposure of 14,000+ user records. The records included a wide range of sensitive information, including full name, contact info, employee’s department, date of birth, etc. These exposed records along with other various SQL server dumps and Rob’s Police Record Exposure is enough to constitute a data breach without even logging into any of the servers.</p>
<p>Henry identified many credential pairs which could have resulted in even more exploitation of many other people. The PII identified is a small sample of a much larger issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/14k-records.png" alt=""><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> was able to identify a relevant Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, affecting an out-of-date application residing on one of the government servers. The remote code execution vulnerability allowed for complete access to sensitive files on the server, including the ability to exfiltrate complete backups of financial records [although data exfiltration wasn’t performed to avoid unnecessary action]</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce1.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce2.png" alt=""><br>
Finally, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a> identified the presence of what appeared to be an extremely important application being hosted by the same server that John had achieved successful Remote Code Execution on. Cottle then chained together multiple vulnerabilities in conjunction with the Remote Code Execution vulnerability, resulting in the ability to hijack any user’s session on the web application. The application contained troves of sensitive government data and could have given a threat actor the ability to perform highly-critical, admin-based government actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/session-chained.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Even though the Indian Government has a RVDP in place, we didn’t feel comfortable disclosing the vulnerabilities right away. The hacking process was far from the standard situation of business-as-usual security research. In total, our report compounded to a massive 34 page report worth of vulnerabilities. We knew that our intent was good, but we wanted to ensure that the US Government had eyes on the situation. Sakura Samurai coordinated with the <a href="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP" title="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP">U.S. DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)</a> to assist in facilitating initial conversations of disclosure. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> spoke with DC3’s Program Manager via email and coordinated on a plan of action.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-1.png" alt=""><br>
Roughly 4 days later, after further communication with the DC3, we felt safe to begin our initial reveal of research on the NCIIPC’s RVDP program.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, the DC3 also commended the hacking that we did in support of making the cyberspace a better place for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, what seemed like a done deal turned out to be quite the unprofessional ride. Any organization knows that fixing breach-worthy vulnerabilities is extremely time sensitive. Once threat actors catch wind of major vulnerabilities against an organization they begin poking on their own, looking for more vectors of attack. Immediately upon revealing that Sakura Samurai was the group responsible for hacking the Indian Government, we followed up with them via Email.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>2021/02/04</strong> - DC3 begins initial contact with the Indian Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai informs the public that they breached the Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai makes contact with the NCIIPC, noting that the report that they received was a result of their research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - The NCIIPC responds, with a basic acknowledgement and thank you for the research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - Sakura Samurai asks for clarification on patching and the responsibility of breach disclosure to the public.<br>
<strong>2021/02/10</strong> - Sakura Samurai, having received no response, asks for an update on the involved remediation and breach notification processes.<br>
<strong>2021/02/16</strong> - Sakura Samurai once again asks for NCIIPC’s plans for remediation and disclosure.<br>
<strong>2021/02/17</strong> - The NCIIPC makes contact, 7-days later, stating that they will follow up in a short time. Again, we ask about plans of anticipated patching and breach notification to the affected citizens.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - In the morning, we ask again about patching and disclosure, 8-hours later and still no response on the matter.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - Sakura Samurai reviews the submitted vulnerability report and notes that only about an eighth or less of the submitted Critical Vulnerabilities have been resolved within a two-week period. No notification of breach has occurred even though Government Employees and Indian Citizens are at risk of exploitation from threat actors.</p>

<p>Governments have an obligation to protect the private data of its employees and citizens. In addition, the exposure of proprietary government data can be used for great means of manipulation and for other destructive purposes. While the NCIIPC operates a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program, the recklessness and avoidance of communication represents the complete opposite of a responsible program. A failure to release notification of breach to affected citizens and to patch highly-critical vulnerabilities in a timely manner reflects poorly on the state of their Information Security posture. The clock to patch vulnerabilities began immediately when the DC3 contacted the NCIIPC via Twitter, as it is a highly visible space - one which threat actors avidly monitor.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai urge the NCIIPC to patch the remainder of the vulnerabilities. The criticality of some of the issues cannot wait weeks or months for adequate resolution.</p>

<p>This is the first post in this blog, it was published on February 19, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>The year of 2020 will be remembered for the pandemic, the BLM movement, and the U.S. elections among other billion of things around the globe. It is funny I even mention the third one considering how little I give a damn about U.S. politics, yet this whole story begins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a> deplatforming that happened about a month ago. Let me remind you: Apple, Google, Amazon, and a few other companies terminated their service to the free speech social network for insufficient moderation effectively destroying the platform in a matter of just a couple of days. What the fuck?</p>

<p>OK, let me be clear with my position: I believe every private company has a right to refuse service to anyone, whether an individual or a business, but I also have my own right to despise them for exercising that. What they did was probably legal, but screw them anyway, they failed us. Regardless what these psychopathic corporations like to tell the public, they are only concerned with maximizing shareholder value, and if there is anything  even remotely resembling an image liability (through pressure by political radicals, cancel culture SJWs, you name it), they will not think twice. What disgusts me the most here is neither greed nor hypocrisy but their unwillingness to grow a pair of balls and stand up for freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You see, freedom of speech and expression must be absolute. You cannot have censorship-resistance with exceptions; otherwise, these exceptions could be used to remove or block anything unwanted, not only offensive. This way, the Chinese cannot access Wikipedia because of what originally started as a counter-terrorism measure, and the Russians cannot access LinkedIn because of what originally started as a children protection measure. We cannot deprive humanity of their freedom just because some small fraction of users might, unfortunately, use that freedom to spread offensive content. In the same way, you do not ban electricity because people get electrocuted.</p>

<p>Let us now switch from corporates to governments. Ooh, wee! Do not even get me started on that. And I am not even talking about cases like Google happily not letting people disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch">SafeSearch</a> in Indonesia because its government knows best, that is just the tip of the iceberg. I am talking about political censorship which includes silencing people with torture, gulags, and bullets. Here is the world map of the freedom of the press status:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/press-freedom.png" alt="2020 Press Freedom Index"></p>

<p>Just look at this mess. Blue tones mean OK-ish, others not so much. This map is <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NordNordWest">NordNordWest</a>’s work based on the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">2020 Press Freedom Index</a> and is distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/legalcode">CC BY-SA 3.0 de</a>. Keep in mind population densities, e.g. there are about 90 times more people per unit area living in Vietnam than Australia. I am actually surprised the U.S. did so well in 2020 considering how badly they wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Mr. Assange</a> to be extradited and executed.</p>

<p>What would you answer your children if they asked you how in the world North Korea still exists in its current form with 25 million Koreans suffering for over 70 years and no one is doing anything about that? Or how about 28 million people in Venezuela? Or 82 million people in Iran? Giving voice to all whistleblowers and activists, especially the ones risking their lives and freedom in hostile environments is the fundamental goal of Pepe.</p>

<h3 id="darknets">Darknets</h3>

<p>There is already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">I2P</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet">Freenet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUnet">GNUnet</a> etc. We can run emails, message boards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kad_network">Kad</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> on top of them, maybe even use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> smart contracts for decentralized computing. All the technology is there, why bother with something new? Well, first of all, these are all amazing projects, there is nothing wrong with them. The peculiar thing, however, is none of them except BitTorrent (and perhaps Tor) gained much popularity, neither do we see any readily available censorship-resistant communication platforms. Why is that?</p>

<p>I claim there are 2 main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are hard to use. The “Unix is user-friendly, it is just picky about who its friends are.” aphorism still lives in most them: you may need to install a bunch of additional software (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a> or shared libraries) potentially dealing with a dependency hell on some platforms; read through sparse documentation and dead forums on optimal network, security, and sharing settings; carefully configure your router, computer, and client; install, study, and configure applications running on top of the darknet, i.e. repeat the steps. The reason why Tor became popular outside of research was not because it was first, but because of the hacky all-in-one Tor Browser Bundle with sane defaults.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They prefer purity to practicality. Instead of concentrating manpower on few specific use cases, most existing tools try to conquer the world: a new internet, interplanetary, infrastructure, an application framework, APIs, a Turing-complete language on the blockchain etc. This is great and all, it is general, conceptual, modular, extensible, and stackable—everything we like—but sometimes overengineering is just overengineering given the goal. And our goal here is not to make a technical revolution, but to help as many people as we can communicate without fear of retribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>BitTorrent evolved into something that is used by 150 million people worldwide, it seamlessly adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_exchange">PEX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">µTP</a>, trackerless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme">magnet links</a>, and people do not even know what the hell it all means. Even though proprietary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> thrived very similarly (at least before it was crippled by Microsoft), millions of its users did not even know what peer-to-peer meant, not to mention how it worked under the hood, it just did. These two systems succeeded not because of luck but rather as a result of some excellent product decisions. We need to learn from that and reiterate.</p>

<h2 id="pepe-overview">Pepe overview</h2>

<h3 id="user-level">User level</h3>

<p>For the messaging platform, I chose to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboard</a> similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaba_Channel">Futaba Channel</a>. While not the most popular type of forum, imageboards are extremely flexible and free of junk like authentication or karma, they promote anonymity in a very practical way, and over 30 million people are already familiar with them. Perhaps, I am not a big fan of their crowded old-school design, but the initial user traction is more important than my sense of beauty, we will refine the looks through time.</p>

<p>That is, the Pepe imageboard is going to be the only application running on top the Pepe darknet, they are in fact inseparable. This way, we can design the network specifically for this one use case. This brings both security and performance benefits. Joining the darknet can be as simple as double clicking the application, and users do not need to install or configure any third-party browsers or proxy servers, they can just go to <a href="http://localhost:8666/">localhost:8666</a> using Chrome, Safari, or whatever they like, and it is going to be safe without any third-party extensions.</p>

<p>Once online, users may browse existing or create new message boards about various topics in any language such as <code>/en/food/</code> or <code>/ja/math/</code>. A board is a collection of threads about something more specific, would it be an idea or a question. A thread has a collection of posts that people send replying to each other. Each post may have one or multiple attachments such as photos, videos, you name it. So that you have an idea of what it looks like, here is a screenshot of a random thread on the 4chan DIY board:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/4chan-thread.png" alt="4chan thread"></p>

<p>What is fundamentally different with Pepe is moderation. Instead of relying on a centralized entity with a banhammer, each board and thread owner may anonymously moderate their spaces on their own. However, nothing can actually be deleted, it can only be shadowed, and each user decides whether they want to see the light or the full version of the page at any moment in time. People can still reply to shadowed posts inside their own shadowed posts, so no one cannot silence anyone, only maintain order on the light side.</p>

<p>If people are no longer interested in particular threads, they will eventually become forgotten by the network and naturally disappear from their board. But if there is at least one person who is subscribed to or has archived some thread, no one in the world (even Pepe creators) can censor or somehow shut it down without hurting most of the network Pepe is running on top of.</p>

<h3 id="network-level">Network level</h3>

<p>The three biggest problems with 4chan and similar communication platforms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They use closed source software so no one can tell how secure everything is and what is really going on there.</li>
  <li>They are centralized, i.e. some individual or business owns the servers and fully controls the whole infrastructure.</li>
  <li>They collect lots of metadata including but not limited to “someone with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> posted this at this moment in time”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigating the first problem is the easiest: just use open-source software whenever possible. Regarding the centralization issue, we could switch to a decentralized solution like BitTorrent (imagine each torrent containing a thread with its posts and attachments), but that itself does not help with privacy, people can still see what others are doing. Similarly, we could tackle the privacy issue with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> or a darknet like Tor or I2P, but that, contrary to popular belief, does not solve the centralization issue in any way. Clearly, we need the best of the two worlds. Let us fuse them together!</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/pepe-routing.png" alt="Pepe routing"></p>

<p>Here is an very simplified walk through how the network works. Imagine Bob is an undercover journalist who wants to anonymously share his report and Alice is a political activist who is interested in the investigation Bob had been doing. It all starts with Bob announcing he has the report:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bob joins the network and gathers information about random peers on it through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>. This way, Bob discovers hundreds of participants including X and Y. Similarly, Bob registers himself on the network through the DHT so that others …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Today, we’re changing our name from TransferWise to Wise.</p>
<p>Our customers now need us for more than money transfers. Sending, spending, and receiving money internationally is too expensive, slow, and inconvenient. We’re fixing that for people and businesses.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/world-meet-wise#transferwise-is-now-wise">skip ahead to see what changes for you</a> (spoiler: not much, right away), but first, let’s go back a bit.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-decade-into-our-mission" id="a-decade-into-our-mission"></a>A decade into our mission</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, Taavet and I set out to fix international money transfers for all of us who’d been overcharged and underserved by banks. We named our idea ‘TransferWise’ — because our early customers were ‘wise’ to know their banks were charging hidden fees in exchange rate markups.</p>
<p>We set ourselves a mission to make money work without borders — to make money move instantly, transparently, conveniently, and — eventually — for free.</p>
<p>Now, we’re a community of 10 million like-minded people and businesses managing money all over the world, saving billions and fighting as hard as ever against hidden fees.</p>
<p>Our multi-currency account and the clever debit card is replacing international banking for many of you. By building this infrastructure for you, we’ve created a platform that more than a dozen banks use today.</p>
<p>You’ve told us for years the problem is bigger than money transfers. Any time money moves into another currency, it’s still a maze of hidden exchange rate markups, high fees, delays, and small print.</p>
<h2><a href="#well-fix-international-banking-together" id="well-fix-international-banking-together"></a>We’ll fix international banking together</h2>
<p>Sending, spending, receiving, and holding money internationally doesn’t work like it should, because the international banking system was built for the past.</p>
<p>For generations, banks have been defined by borders. Traditional bank accounts trap our money in one country, making international lives more difficult and expensive than they need to be. We shouldn’t have to accept this status quo.</p>
<p>Today, we don’t. We’ll fix it with Wise — the world’s most international account. It makes your money borderless — with instant, super-cheap money transfers, a debit card to spend in any currency, account details to get paid in 30+ countries, balances to hold your money safely in 50+ different currencies, multi-currency direct debits, and other revolutionary features.</p>
<h2><a href="#transferwise-is-now-wise" id="transferwise-is-now-wise"></a>TransferWise is now Wise</h2>
<p>Today our name catches up with who we’re already building for — a community of people and businesses with multi-currency lives. Wise is for all of us who live, work, travel, or support family around the world. It’s for those of us who want to cut out the middlemen that hold us back from being truly borderless.</p>
<p>For customers, not too much will change right away. We become “Wise” or “Wise Business” — depending how you use us. You can access your exact same account via <a href="http://wise.com/">wise.com</a>, using your current email and password. You won't need a new account. In a few weeks we will start to redirect transferwise.com to wise.com.</p>
<p>Our logo has changed, and our apps will be renamed. But our icon — the fast flag — remains as a symbol for money without borders. Beyond that, you’ll notice some new colours, words, and designs.</p>
<p>The core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We’re still making — and always will be making — money work without borders.</p>
<p>We’re humbled that 10 million of you already rely on us to help you lead your international lives. We can’t wait to bring the next 100 million of you with us as we continue to build a new, fair, and transparent world of money.</p>
<p>Onwards.</p>
