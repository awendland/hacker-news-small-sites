								<p>
								Welcome back to Fightin’ Words! It’s been a while since we last discussed how the <a href="https://ki.infil.net/w01-bugs.html">most famous fighting game bugs</a> have impacted the community’s favorite games. Today’s topic is a bit more technical, but it’s an equally important factor in how our favorite modern games are played -- we’re going to be doing a <strong>deep dive into netcode</strong>.								
								</p>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->
								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_lecture.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								At its core, netcode is simply a method for two or more computers, each trying to play the same game, to talk to each other over the internet. While local play always ensures that all player inputs arrive and are processed at the same time, <strong>networks are constantly unstable</strong> in ways the game cannot control or predict. Information sent to your opponent may be delayed, arrive out of order, or become lost entirely depending on dozens of factors, including the physical distance to your opponent, if you’re on a WiFi connection, and whether your roommate is watching Netflix.
								</p><p>
								Online play in games is nothing new, but fighting games have their own set of unique challenges. They tend to involve direct connections to other players, unlike many other popular game genres, and <strong>low, consistent latency</strong> is extremely important because muscle memory and reactions are at the core of virtually every fighting game. As a result, two prominent strategies have emerged for playing fighting games online: <strong>delay-based netcode</strong> and <strong>rollback netcode</strong>. 
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_thoughtful.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
								There’s been a renewed passion in the fighting game community that <strong>rollback is the best choice</strong>, and fighting game developers who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW61xJNJ9m8">choose to use delay-based netcode</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTUtnclr2hs">preventing the growth of the genre</a>. While people have been passionate about this topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu2kAdmUCaI&amp;t=42m34s">for many years</a>, frustrations continue to rise as new, otherwise excellent games repeatedly have bad online experiences.
								</p><p>

								There are relatively few easy-to-follow explanations for what exactly rollback netcode is, how it works, and why it is so good at hiding the effects of bad connections (though <a href="http://mauve.mizuumi.net/2012/07/05/understanding-fighting-game-networking.html">there are some</a>). Because I feel this topic is extremely important for the future health of the fighting game community, I want to help squash some misconceptions about netcode and explain both netcode strategies thoroughly so everyone can be informed as they discuss. If you stick around to the end, I’ll even <strong>interview some industry experts and community leaders</strong> on the topic!
								</p><p>
								Before we dig into the details, though, let’s get one thing straight.
										
								</p></div>
								</div>

								<hr><!-- Infil -->

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_smiling_3.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
										Both companies and players should care about good netcode because <strong>playing online is no longer the future -- it's the present</strong>. 
								</p><p>
										While most other video game genres have been this way for a decade or longer, fighting game developers seem to be resistant to embracing online play, perhaps because of the genre’s roots in offline settings such as arcades and tournaments. Playing offline is great, and it will always have considerable value in fighting games, but it’s simply a reality that <strong>a large percentage of the player base will never play offline</strong>. For many fighting game fans, playing online <em>is</em> the game, and a bad online experience prevents them from getting better, playing or recommending the game to their friends, and ultimately causes them to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTUtnclr2hs?t=758">simply go do something else</a>.
								</p><p>
										Even if you think you have a good connection, or live in an area of the world with robust internet infrastructure, good netcode is still mandatory. Plus, lost or delayed information happens regularly even on the best networks, and poor netcode can <a href="https://twitter.com/john_takeuchi/status/1162562266027327488">actively hamper matches</a> no matter how smooth the conditions may be. Good netcode also has the benefit of connecting regions across greater distances, effectively uniting the global player base as much as possible.

											</figcaption></figure></div>
										
								</div>
								</div>

								<div><p><img src="https://ki.infil.net/images/words/infil_content.jpg"></p>
								<div><p>
										What about those who never play online because they much prefer playing offline with their friends? The <strong>healthy ecosystem</strong> that good netcode creates around a game benefits everyone. There will be more active players, more chances to consume content for your favorite game -- from tech videos to spectating online tournaments to expanding the strategy of lesser-used characters -- and more excitement surrounding your game in the FGC. Despite <a href="http://ki.infil.net/">Killer Instinct</a>’s pedigree as an excellent game, there’s no doubt that its superb rollback netcode has played a huge part in the sustained growth of its community.
								</p><p>

										Good netcode matters, period. So let’s talk about it.

<![CDATA[Translating My Z3 Tutorial to Coq]]>

<p>I had a fun time giving a Z3 tutorial at Formal Methods for the Informal Engineer (FMIE) <a href="https://fmie2021.github.io/">https://fmie2021.github.io/</a> (videos coming soon hopefully!). I got to be kind of the "fun dad" with the Z3 tutorial <a href="https://github.com/philzook58/z3_tutorial">https://github.com/philzook58/z3_tutorial</a> , while at times it felt a bit like Cody's Coq tutorial <a href="https://github.com/codyroux/broad-coq-tutorial">https://github.com/codyroux/broad-coq-tutorial</a> was trying to feed the kids their vegetables. It was a fantastic tutorial (maybe the best I've seen?), but it was tough love. He knew it was going to be like this from the outset and had a fun little analogy of me downhill skiing while he was about to go on an uphill mountaineering slog.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors to lead to this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I could use Z3’s python bindings giving an air of familiarity, whereas everything was incredibly foreign in Coq.</li>
  <li>Z3 can actually be used to declaratively state problems and pushbutton calculate solutions to them with very little user help, which gives it a lot more "Wow" factor.</li>
  <li>Coq is a tool that requires significantly more background to even comprehend what the hell it is. I still think many aspects of it are totally bizarre. But Coq users, this is just the water they swim in. For example, defining an inductive predicate as a datatype is still a bizarre notion to me, but it is Coq 101. I say this to Coq users and they look at me like I’m nuts. “What could even be the problem?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, a fun exercise for me was to take the examples from my tutorial and try to translate them into Coq. For the most part I think it isn't that hard and rather educational.</p>
<p>It's interesting the things that show up. Because the Z3 tutorial was designed for automation, the more automated tactics in MicroOmega and Ring are super useful. </p>
<p><a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html">https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/micromega.html</a></p>
<p>
The thing is that the sort of proofs that show up here are fine and all, but they aren't going to teach you to fish for yourself. When you step out of this super automatable fragment you're sunk if you don't know other techniques, like the ones Cody was teaching. There may be a better balance of fun and education to be found.</p>
<p>I think there is a hole in the educational content out there on Coq. Software Foundations focuses on the rudiments, CPDT and FRAP kind of takes it a little hardcore, and the Mathematical Components stuff makes you buy in on ssreflect style and some hardcore math topics, both of which are nuts I have not cracked. Also, all of them are really long and initimidating. Seems like there should be something a little more breezy, a little more automatic. It is demoralizing as a beginner to either not know how to prove obvious trivial facts, or even to struggle to do so at great length.</p>
<p>This was also a nice opportunity to take Alectryon by Clément Pit-Claudel out for a spin <a href="https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon">https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon</a> Alectryon allows you to see the proof state on hover over in your browser. It's a super important part of the Coq. It was pretty easy to put in my blog. Just copy and paste the gnarly html output into a Jekyll post and make sure to link in the CSS files in an assets folder, because they are where the magic happens.</p>
<p>The gist for this post is here <a href="https://gist.github.com/philzook58/acd204b4895c41f9e85618f0f6b30a58">https://gist.github.com/philzook58/acd204b4895c41f9e85618f0f6b30a58</a></p>
<div id="intro-stuff">

<p>The very first problem in the tutorial was</p>
<pre><!-- Generator: Alectryon --><span><span><span>(** python</span>
<span>x = Int('x')</span>
<span>y = Int('y')</span>
<span>solve(x &gt; 2, y &lt; 10, x + 2*y == 7)</span>
<span>*)</span></span></span></pre><p>which Z3 returns the solution [y = 0, x = 7].</p>
<p>It isn't so obvious how to get coq to find this solution in a low effort way. However, it is easy to get Coq to confirm the validity of this solution given that you know about the [lia] tactic. Otherwise it may be kind of annoying. In general, it may be a good approach to use external tools to produce solutions and just manually place the solutions into Coq. Validating a solution is often easier than producing it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is a much delayed discussion on the complexity and nuance of the SolarWind hack. The simplistic and wrong messaging from some quarters of the infosec community has resulted in an atrocious misunderstanding of the hack in the public sphere. This has extended into the policy world as these bad takes are treated as cogent analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thegrugq/status/1341439709487087618?s=21">I wrote this back in December</a>, but months later this <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/26/politics/solarwinds123-password-intern/index.html">bad analysis is still brought up in the policy space.</a></p>
<h2>Espionage is the second oldest profession</h2>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that with spying, the ends justify the means. This is true for all espionage organisations, the opposition’s and your own. Why is that relevant? Because any standard which is used to hamper the opposition will also apply to, and hamper, yours.</p>
<p>Sometimes laying down blanket rules about acceptable espionage behaviour is not a problem. Almost always this is when a certain type of operation is out of character with the society that produces the espionage agency. China makes extensive use of their diaspora community for espionage. The US has thousands of trained professionals and doesn’t use their diaspora community for organic bottom up collection. The US sometimes coopts civilians (and China has professionals) but generally speaking the diaspora method is one that only China uses extensively.</p>
<p>Extending this a bit further: if an espionage rule was proposed that banned the use of professionals but allowed the use of amateur civilians, China would be able to easily adapt to the new espionage environment. The US would be severely constrained. For this reason, the US wouldn’t sign up to, or abide by, such a requirement. (This is complicated further by the nature of targets for espionage, and national policy, but we can explore that another day.)</p>
<p>This brings me to targeting civilian companies and supply chain attacks. The US uses these methods just as, if not more, frequently than the Russians. FLAME, a strain of malware that targeted entities in the Middle East, exploited a cryptologic bug in the way Microsoft signed their updates. The NSA was then able to inject malicious code into the updates of Microsoft software. And just like SolarWinds, it was specifically targeted to ensure only legitimate espionage targets were infected and collected.</p>
<p><strong>There is no rule that would prohibit the SolarWinds espionage campaign which the US would be willing to abide by itself.</strong></p>
<h2>Russian Intelligence aren’t script kiddies</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing: the attackers are Russian foreign intelligence, the cream of the old KGB, and they will find a way to gain access to their target. Do they need to recruit a developer at the company and trick them into installing malware? They will do that.</p>
<p>They do not need to access the target via a weak password on the build servers. If that is what they use, then that is what they use, but it is not the make or break factor for the operation.</p>
<p>Part of the problem here might be that a superficial understanding of the cyber kill chain gives the impression that if you just stop <strong>The One Critical TTP</strong> in the chain then you will defeat the opposition. This is only true for an opposition that is inflexible and using just one technique. That description does not apply to the Russian intelligence services.</p>
<p>Intelligence agencies have targets and they will find the techniques to access them. The don’t start with a technique and look for targets that they can access.</p>
<p>The SolarWind backdoor was deeply integrated into the code, it was injected during their build process, and there is no way that the server having a weak password was the pivotal factor. As if Russian Intelligence would just give up if there were a strong password instead!</p>
<p>There is practically no chance that the server’s password was in anyway relevant to the hack overall. I can forgive the ignorance from the news media, but some infosec people are repeating this garbage as if it is important part of the SolarWind compromise.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The offense is routinely underestimated. When companies are hacked, they react as if they had only done this one thing or avoided this one mistake everything would have been okay. The adversary is treated as if they just got lucky.” — Network Attacks and Exploitation <a href="https://twitter.com/networkattack">@networkattack</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People suggesting that the weak password example is relevant because it illustrates the poor security practices overall. I would agree with you if that was the argument presented. It was not. You have to work with the words ppl said, not what you wish they’d said.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘’Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds’ update server by using the password “solarwinds123”<br>
“This could have been done by any attacker, easily,” Kumar said.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I absolutely agree with the “it is illustrative of poor security practice” but… that isn’t what was said. They literally said that the weak password means that the attacker could be anyone. Anyone could do it. That is the dumbest take.</p>
<h2>The KGB vs a software vendor? Bet KGB.</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<p>I’m perfectly willing to believe that their build servers were using “admin:admin” and that’s how the Russians gained access to inject their code… but, this was a clandestine intelligence operation. They did not succeed merely because SolarWind had poor password hygiene.</p>
<p>The SVR was formed from the cream of the KGB — the first chief directorate (FCD). The most prestigious directorate in the KGB. As the SVR they are still formidable.</p>
<h2>Was SolarWind picked due to its poor security?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I suspect the primary motivation was the access that would be enabled by the attack, not the vulnerable nature of the company. This is the SVR, the cream of the KGB (first chief directorate). They are not going to be bothered by password policy.</p>
<p>That’s what kinda annoys me… however easy SolarWind may have been to hack, they were hacked by the fucking First Chief Directorate of the KGB. Quite possibly the people that are frying diplomats brains with microwaves in Havana. They’re pretty fucking metal.</p>
<p>Could SolarWind have been too difficult for the KGB to use them in an enablement operation? Yes, it is possible to achieve that level of security. Creating a strong fast detection capability with rapid remediation and incident response will make it hard for attackers to dwell for any length of time, or persist on the system after they gain access. It requires vigilance and some effort, but it can be done. Of course, SolarWind wasn’t close to reaching that level.</p>

					Having a memory of past events enables us to take smarter decisions about the future. Researchers at the Max-Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPI-DS) and the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have now identified how the slime mold Physarum polycephalum saves memories – although it has no nervous system.
				</p></header><section><p>The ability to store and recover information gives an organism a clear advantage when searching for food or avoiding harmful environments. Traditionally it has been attributed to organisms that have a nervous system.</p><p>A new study authored by Mirna Kramar (MPI-DS) and <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/alim-karen" title="Profile of Prof. Dr. Karen Alim" target="_blank">Prof. Karen Alim</a> (TUM and MPI-DS) challenges this view by uncovering the surprising abilities of a highly dynamic, single-celled organism to store and retrieve information about its environment.</p><div id="c62766"><div><div><p>The slime mold Physarum polycephalum has been puzzling researchers for many decades. Existing at the crossroads between the kingdoms of animals, plants and fungi, this unique organism provides insight into the early evolutionary history of eukaryotes – to which also humans belong.</p><p>Its body is a giant single cell made up of interconnected tubes that form intricate networks. This single amoeba-like cell may stretch several centimeters or even meters, featuring as the largest cell on earth in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p></div></div></div><div id="c62767"><div><div><p>“It is very exciting when a project develops from a simple experimental observation”, says Karen Alim, head of the Biological Physics and Morphogenesis group at the MPI-DS in Göttingen and professor for the <a href="http://www.bpm.ph.tum.de/" target="_blank">Theory of Biological Networks</a> at the Technical University of Munich.</p><p>When the researchers followed the migration and feeding process of the organism and observed a distinct imprint of a food source on the pattern of thicker and thinner tubes of the network long after feeding.</p><p>“Given P. polycephalum's highly dynamic network reorganization, the persistence of this imprint sparked the idea that the network architecture itself could serve as memory of the past“, says Karen Alim. However, they first needed to explain the mechanism behind the imprint formation.</p></div></div></div><div id="c62768"><div><div><p>For this purpose the researchers combined microscopic observations of the adaption of the tubular network with theoretical modeling. An encounter with food triggers the release of a chemical that travels from the location where food was found throughout the organism and softens the tubes in the network, making the whole organism reorient its migration towards the food.</p><p>“The gradual softening is where the existing imprints of previous food sources come into play and where information is stored and retrieved”, says first author Mirna Kramar. “Past feeding events are embedded in the hierarchy of tube diameters, specifically in the arrangement of thick and thin tubes in the network.”</p><p>“For the softening chemical that is now transported, the thick tubes in the network act as highways in traffic networks, enabling quick transport across the whole organism”, adds Mirna Kramar. “Previous encounters imprinted in the network architecture thus weigh into the decision about the future direction of migration.”</p></div></div></div><div id="c62769"><div><div><p>„Given the simplicity of this living network, the ability of Physarum to form memories is intriguing. It is remarkable that the organism relies on such a simple mechanism and yet controls it in such a fine-tuned manner,” says Karen Alim.</p><p>“These results present an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the behavior of this ancient organism and at the same time points to universal principles underlying behavior. We envision potential applications of our findings in designing smart materials and building soft robots that navigate through complex environments”, concludes Karen Alim.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>

A large part of that is due to some early advice I received from a man who had also recently divorced:</p><blockquote>It will all work out. Just keep the focus on the kids and relationship will improve. We're at the stage where my ex will come around and have drinks with my girlfriend and I.

            <p>Welcome to the third part of this series aimed to help you unleash a power never seen on Earth using the Almighty Vim. If you don’t understand what’s happening in this article, I recommend you to read the previous ones of the series first:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-beginner/">Vim for beginners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-intermediate/">Vim for intermediate users</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll see together in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some nice keystrokes beginning with <code>g</code>.</li>
<li>What ranges are and how to use them.</li>
<li>The quickfix list and the location lists.</li>
<li>The marvelous substitute command.</li>
<li>The crazy useful <code>:global</code> (or <code>:g</code>) command.</li>
<li>What marks are and what you can do with them.</li>
<li>How to increase and decrease numbers with a single keystroke.</li>
<li>How to sort text with a nice command.</li>
</ul>
<p>But before going into the juicy content of this article, I’ve some recommendations for you, dear reader:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire up your Vim and play around with the commands and keystrokes while reading. It’s the best way for you to remember everything which blew you away. You’ll then be able to be blown away whenever you like for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Don’t use a cheatsheet; write your own as you read. It will allow you to come back easily to the commands you find the most useful for <em>your own needs</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enough rambling. Let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="useful-g-keystrokes">Useful “g” Keystrokes</h2>
<p>Let’s begin gently with a mixed bag of keystrokes starting with <code>g</code>. There are many of these “g” commands in Vim, and we already saw some of them in the previous articles. Can you recall them?</p>
<p>You can use these keystrokes in NORMAL mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gf</code> - Edit the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>CTRL+W CTRL+F</code> to open the file in a new window.</li>
<li>It can open the URL under your cursor if you have the plugin <code>netrw</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gx</code> - Open the file located at the filepath under your cursor.
<ul>
<li>It will use the default application used by your OS for this filetype.</li>
<li>It works with URLs too. It will open your favorite browser and load the website.</li>
<li>It only works if you have the plugin <code>netrw</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gi</code> - Move to the last insertion you did and switch to INSERT mode.
<ul>
<li>Pretty useful if you stopped your editing to look at some other file.</li>
<li>It uses marks under the hood: more on that later in this article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>gv</code> - Start VISUAL mode and use the selection made during the last VISUAL mode.</li>
<li><code>gn</code> - Select the match of your last search:
<ol>
<li>Move to the last searched match.</li>
<li>Switch to VISUAL mode (if you weren’t in VISUAL mode already).</li>
<li>Select the match.</li>
<li>You can continue to hit <code>n</code> (or <code>gn</code>) to select the area between the current match and the next match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>gI</code> - Insert text at the beginning of the line, no matter what the first characters are.
<ul>
<li>The keystroke <code>I</code> insert text <em>just before the first non-blank characters</em> of the line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To try out <code>gf</code> and <code>gx</code>, you can write for example <code>https://www.google.com/</code> in Vim, place your cursor on it, and hit the keystrokes. Don’t forget the trailing slash in your URL.</p>
<p>You’ll soon discover an inconvenience with <code>gx</code>: when you use it on a filepath, Vim will hang till you close the file. That’s why I’ve created the following mapping you can add to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>nnoremap gX :silent :execute
            \ "!xdg-open" expand('%:p:h') . "/" . expand("&lt;cfile&gt;") " &amp;"&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre><p>It maps the keystroke <code>gX</code> to use <code>xdg-open</code>  with the filepath under your cursor. It will open the file with your favorite application <em>in the background</em>. The program <code>xdg-open</code> will only work on Linux-based systems; for MacOS, try <code>open</code> instead.</p>


  




    





  





<h2 id="ranges">Ranges</h2>
<p>Now that we’re done with the appetizers, let’s discover the first real dish of our Vim feast: the ranges. You can apply them to many commands, making them terribly powerful.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>In Vim’s help, every command accepting a range will have the string of characters <code>[range]</code> in front of them. Multiple line specifiers are possible, separated by commas <code>,</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the most interesting ranges you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;number&gt;</code> - Any number <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> in your range refers to a line number.</li>
<li><code>.</code> - Represent the current line (often the default range).</li>
<li><code>$</code> - Represent the last line of the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>%</code> - Represent the entire file (same as <code>1,$</code>).</li>
<li><code>*</code> - Use the last selection you’ve made during the last VISUAL mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, using the command <code>:d</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:1,40d</code> - Delete line 1 to 40 included.</li>
<li><code>:2,$d</code> - Delete every line from the second one till the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>:.,$d</code> - Delete every line from the current one till the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>:%d</code> - Delete every line.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also do some arithmetic with ranges if you want. For example, let’s imagine your cursor is on the line 60: the range <code>.,.+10</code> will be equivalent to the range <code>60,70</code>.</p>
<h3 id="visual-mode-and-range">Visual Mode and Range</h3>
<p>If you switch to COMMAND-LINE mode after doing some selection in VISUAL mode, you’ll see these two symbols appearing: <code>'&lt;</code> and <code>'&gt;</code> with a comma <code>,</code> in between. This is a range too!</p>
<p>The symbols <code>'&lt;</code> represents the first line you’ve selected and <code>'&gt;</code> the last line. Each of these are marks; again, we’ll see more about marks below.</p>
<p>In practice, the ranges <code>'&lt;,'&gt;</code> and <code>*</code> are synonym, but you’ll have more flexibility with the first. For example, you can execute a command from the first line you’ve selected till the end of the file with the range <code>'&lt;,$</code>.</p>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help [range]</code></li>
<li><code>:help v_:</code></li>
<li><code>:help '&lt;</code></li>
<li><code>:help '&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h2 id="vims-quickfix-and-location-list">Vim’s Quickfix And Location List</h2>
<p>Now, let’s talk about a very useful data structure available in Vim, the quickfix list.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the quickfix list and the quickfix window: these are two different entities. The first is a data structure, the second can display this data structure.</p>
<h3 id="quickfix-lists">Quickfix Lists</h3>
<p>You can think of a quickfix list as a set of positions in one or multiple files.</p>
<h4 id="basics-1">Basics</h4>
<p>Let’s take an example: what happens if you run the command <code>:vimgrep hello *</code>?</p>
<ol>
<li>It will search the pattern “hello” in every file of your working directory.</li>
<li>It will populate a quickfix list with every position matching your pattern “hello”.</li>
<li>It will move your cursor to the first position of the quickfix list.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to know more about vimgrep and other tools you can search with, I <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-search-find-replace/">wrote an article about that</a>. Other commands (like <code>:make</code> or <code>:grep</code>) also populate automatically a quickfix list.</p>
<p>Let’s expand the mystery around marks: these positions in the quickfix list are in fact hidden mark!</p>
<p>The quickfix list is often used to display specific errors in a codebase, often spit out from a compiler or a linter (via the command <code>:make</code> for example), but not only, as we just saw. I call the entries of a quickfix list “positions” to be more general, but sometimes Vim’s help will refer to them as “errors”. Don’t be confused: it’s the same idea.</p>
<p>Among other conditions, a quickfix list entry needs to have a filename for you to be able to jump to its position. Otherwise, the entry doesn’t point to anything. Difficult to move to anything.</p>
<h4 id="useful-commands">Useful Commands</h4>
<p>Here are the commands you can use to navigate through the current quickfix list:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cl</code> or <code>:clist</code> - Display all valid entries of the current quickfix list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).</li>
<li><code>:cc &lt;number&gt;</code> - Move to the <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>th entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cnext</code> or <code>:cn</code> - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cprevious</code> or <code>:cp</code> - Move to the previous entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cfirst</code> or <code>:cfir</code> - Move to the first entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:clast</code> or <code>:clas</code> - Move to the last entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are additional commands which make quickfix lists really powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cdo &lt;cmd&gt;</code> - Execute a command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code> on each valid entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cexpr &lt;expr&gt;</code> or <code>:cex &lt;expr&gt;</code> - Create a quickfix list using the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><code>:caddexpr &lt;expr&gt;</code> or <code>:cadde &lt;expr&gt;</code> - Appends the result of evaluating the Vimscript expression <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> to the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have no clue how to use the last two commands, you can do for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:cex []</code> - Empty the current quickfix list.</li>
<li><code>:cex system("&lt;cmd&gt;")</code> - Populate your quickfix list with any shell command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code>. You can try it with <code>ls</code> for example.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-quickfix-window">The Quickfix Window</h3>
<p>What about displaying the current quickfix list in a new buffer? You can do that with the following command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:copen</code> or <code>:cope</code> - Open a window (with a special buffer) to show the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can only have one quickfix window open. To move to the position of the selected entry of the quickfix list in the quickfix window, hit <code>ENTER</code> or <code>.cc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="location-lists">Location Lists</h3>
<p>A location list is similar to a quickfix list, except that the first is local to a window and the second is global to your Vim instance. In other words, you can have multiple location lists available at the same time (one per window open), but you can only have access to one quickfix list.</p>
<p>The commands for location lists are similar to the ones for the quickfix lists; often, you’ll only have to replace the first <code>c</code> (qui<code>c</code>fix) of the command with <code>l</code> (<code>l</code>ocation).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:lli</code> or <code>:llist</code> - Display all valid entries of the current location list. You can add a range as argument (only numbers).</li>
<li><code>:ll &lt;number&gt;</code> - Move to the entry <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> of the current location list.</li>
<li><code>:lnext</code> or <code>:lne</code> - Move to the next entry of the current quickfix list.</li>
</ul>
<p>To populate your location list you can also use the commands <code>:lvimgrep</code> or <code>:lmake</code> for example.</p>
<p>Often, Vim users will use the quickfix list for anything related to errors in their codebase, and the location list for search results. But it’s up to you at the end of the day. With Vim, you’re the master of your destiny.</p>

<div>
<p><span><span>Reading Time: </span> <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span></span></p><p>It’s a story that’s becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>You’re smack dab in the middle of harvest and an error code appears on your combine’s monitor. A call to the dealership results in a long wait for a technician to come out, with anxiety rising with every passing hour because priceless harvesting time is being lost or, worse, nasty weather is moving in.</p>
<p>Then when the technician gets to your farm, he determines what is needed is to reset (or ‘flash’) the onboard computer.</p>
<p>That happened to Cole Siegle last fall when he was harvesting canola, leaving the Fairview-area producer to wonder why he can’t have access to the same diagnostic tools.</p>
<div id="attachment_133445"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120509/repair-rights1-siegle-supplied.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>Cole Siegle.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>“If I could have done that myself or been able to use a mechanic or a technician who’s closer to me, our downtime could have gone from six hours to two hours,” he said. “That four hours could have been the difference between getting&nbsp;a crop off before the snow or not.”</p>
<p>But these days it’s dealerships — via sales and service agreements with manufacturers — that have legal access to these diagnostic tools. So when an error message pops up, farmers and independent mechanics are out in the cold, sometimes literally.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Read more: <a href="https://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/news/remote-diagnostics-blocked-by-poor-internet-on-farms/">Remote diagnostics blocked by poor internet on farms</a></strong></li>

</ul>
<p>“As a producer I think we need access to these diagnostic tools,” said Siegle. “If (manufacturers) want to continue to build equipment like this that’s fine, but we need access to the laptops with the programs that we can plug into our equipment so we can buy whatever part we need.”</p>
<p>Equipment manufacturers make a lot of repair information public, including what codes mean, but giving access to proprietary tools raises several issues, said John Schmeiser, CEO of the Western Equipment Dealers Association.</p>
<p>The hardware and software Siegle and other farmers wish to acquire for repair purposes can also be used to modify equipment to the detriment of machinery, warranties, the lawfulness of their operations and even their own safety, he said.</p>
<p>“I applaud the manufacturers that put a lot of stuff online&nbsp;like parts, service manuals and operational guides. But it’s a slippery slope,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“When you provide special tools to somebody outside a controlled environment like the manufacturer/dealer&nbsp;relationship, that opens the door for illegal modification. They lose that control when they provide&nbsp;diagnostic or special tools to a third-party retailer with whom they don’t have the same sales and services agreement.”</p>
<h2>Repair versus modify</h2>
<p>‘Right to repair’ is a term being thrown around a lot in ag circles today, but it means different things to different people.</p>
<p>For Siegle and other like-minded producers, it means the right to either repair equipment themselves or hire an unaffiliated local mechanic — just as farmers have done throughout the history of mechanized agriculture.</p>
<div id="attachment_133446"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.albertafarmexpress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22120516/SchmeiserJohn.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px"></p><p>John Schmeiser.<br><small><i>photo:</i><span> Supplied </span></small></p></div>
<p>But Schmeiser argues that farmers’ right to repair is already entrenched in law in many jurisdictions (including Alberta) as long as the owner is using the equipment for its intended purpose and doesn’t violate manufacturer standards.</p>
<p>The right to repair (R2R) movement (which started in the tech sphere but expanded to other areas, such as ag equipment) is actually a front for promoting the ‘right to modify,’ he said.</p>
<p>Often that means making modifications to bypass environmental controls in order to boost vehicle horsepower.</p>

<p>“There are over 25 states that had R2R bills introduced — every one impacting farm equipment has been defeated,” said Schmeiser. “They haven’t passed&nbsp;because as the state representatives were hearing the rationale coming from R2R advocates, they were finding out that what they were really looking for is to modify the equipment in a manner where&nbsp;it can get around emission standards and violate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laws and regulations.”</p>
<h2>DEF delete and chipping</h2>
<p>There are two specific actions that concern Schmeiser’s association (a Missouri-based advocacy group for equipment dealerships with a Canadian headquarters in Calgary).</p>
<p>One is circumventing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (or DEF) emissions systems using grey-market ‘DEF delete’ kits to boost horsepower on tractors and combines. Another is ‘chipping’ or ‘tuning,’ which usually refers to adding a specific chip to increase horsepower.</p>
<p>Bypassing emissions control systems contravenes the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, leaving producers open to fines, said Schmeiser, adding he was unsure of the Canadian penalties but breaches of similar U.S. laws have produced fines in excess of $300,000.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that not everyone knows this practice is illegal. Another is it comes with a host of potential risks including damaged equipment, voided warranties, reduced trade-in value, insurance cancellation and even safety, he said.</p>
<p>“We have seen an unusual number of combine fires this (past) year,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“Now, we have had some dry conditions but in some of those cases the combines were running hotter (due to alterations).</p>

<p>“The insurance company will look at it from the standpoint that you have altered your combine away from the manufacturer’s original standards and you are going to be denied insurance coverage in a situation like that.”</p>
<p>But Siegle isn’t convinced.</p>
<p>He said he has no interest in making such modifications to his equipment and suggested it’s a straw man argument from manufacturing and dealership interests seeking exclusive control over the diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>The kind of modification Siegle is concerned about losing is the legal ability to place, for example, a third-party manufacturer’s custom header on a John Deere combine. Specifically, he worries about big manufacturers denying third-party companies the codes required for an implement to interact with a tractor or combine.</p>
<p>Schmeiser said this isn’t considered modification but rather interoperability or connectivity: A third party designing an implement to attach to another manufacturer’s product. This is a long-standing tradition in the manufacturing and dealership industries that few if anyone has any interest in ceasing, he said (see accompanying story).</p>
<h2>The business aspect</h2>
<p>All of this still does not answer Siegle’s fundamental question: Why can’t I — or mechanics unaffiliated with specific manufacturers — have all the tools required to diagnose and fix a mechanical problem?</p>
<p>In the past it was relatively easy for mechanically minded producers and unaffiliated mechanics to repair machinery because it ran on tried-and-traditional engineering principles. This is still by and large the case, said Schmeiser, adding 95 per cent of equipment issues can still be fixed mechanically.</p>
<p>He said he understands the frustration farmers feel by not having diagnostic tools at their fingertips. But at the same time dealerships have rights as well, especially when one considers the considerable training and expense needed to obtain service contracts with manufacturers.</p>
<p>“What the farmer is speaking to is the frustration of being down. He wants to get up and running as quickly as possible. We get that,” said Schmeiser.</p>
<p>“But the moment the manufacturers start providing special tools or diagnostics&nbsp;equipment to businesses that are outside of their dealer contracts, doesn’t that diminish the value of the contract in the dealer’s eyes as well?… So what’s the incentive for the manufacturer&nbsp;to provide special tools or even service manuals to a third party that would be competing with somebody they have a contractual relationship with&nbsp;(and) who is also making a substantial financial investment to be the representative for the manufacturer?”</p> </div>

<p>TL;DR: It’s possible to mine Ethereum on a M1 Mac GPU. Hashrate is about 2Mh/s.</p>

<p>I’ve had my M1 MacBook Air for a bit of time now, and I also recently started mining Ethereum. I can’t help asking myself: What’s Ethereum mining performance like on a M1 Mac?</p>



<p>The obvious thing to do first is to run the off-the-shelf <code>ethminer</code>, which gives the following error:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-alpha.0
Build: darwin/release/appleclang

Unrecognized platform Apple
Error: No usable mining devices found</code></pre>



<p>Not good. Apparently Apple GPUs are not whitelisted in ethminer. That should be easy to fix. Relevant lines are in <code>libethash-cl/CLMiner.cpp</code>, and I added Apple GPUs to the whitelist, pretending it’s an Intel GPU.</p>



<p>Then <code>boost</code> won’t compile since it’s trying to compile with a <code>-fcoalesce-templates</code> argument, which doesn’t exist in recent clang versions. So I have to update <code>boost</code> to the latest version, and fix relevant <code>asio</code> code since <code>ethminer</code> was using deprecated <code>asio</code> APIs.</p>



<p>I also need to upgrade OpenSSL to the latest version to have it support darwin + arm64.</p>



<p>After getting everything to compile. Here’s the result:</p>



<pre><code>ethminer 0.19.0-17+commit.ce52c740.dirty

<h2>Is it worth it?</h2>



<p>Um. Not really. At current Ethereum prices (2021-02-26), it generates $0.14 of profit per day. It’s still a profit, but very miniscule.</p>
