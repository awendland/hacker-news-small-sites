  <article>
    <p>I’ve now worked with “The Cloud” for long enough to see that there’s still a long way to
go before it becomes materially better than, say, the oldschool method of renting a
couple of servers with a co-location company and running your software there. The
latest fad is Serverless, which makes me feel a lot like we’ve arrived in 1970.</p>

<p>A long, long time ago, I was pretending to study business administration
while teaching myself to code in C. The university was in two worlds:
we had a lab with “personal computers” but also terminals to the mini
computer and assignments had to be made on either one depending on the
professors’ preferences. But both systems were at least “on-line” systems–interactive, with immediate feedback. A friend of mine was not so lucky:
he had an assignment for one of his courses in civil engineering that
had to be completed in Pascal and had to be handed in as a print-out
from the university’s mainframe.</p>

<p>He called me in for help, because he never wrote a line of code before. So I hopped
over to his place, a Turbo Pascal floppy disk in hand, and assumed that we would
make short work of the assignment. And we did, even though I never coded in Pascal
before: the IDE, even back then, was marvellous and a quick succession of trial-and-error
got us the results we wanted (they were some simple engineering calculations, much
quicker done on even the most primitive of calculators, but such are course assignments. At
least it was easy for us to verify the program was correct).</p>

<p>We hopped into the car and drove over the the university’s computer center, a ’70s brutalist
concrete bunker. We sat behind a terminal, typed in the code, surrounded it with the required
IBM Job Control Language that the teaching assistant helpfully added to the assignment, and
hit “Enter” (not “Return”, actually “Enter” - Enter The Job). A couple of minutes later, the
printer started and spit out a couple of pages. Between gibberish in all caps, there it was: a
compiler error. Back to square one - Turbo Pascal and IBM Mainframe Pascal clearly had some
differences. A couple of hours and reams of wasted paper later, we had what my friend wanted:
the results of a good run. The numbers matched our notes, and we could retreat to the nearest
bar for a well-earned beer.</p>

<p>Ever since that experience, I have stressed the value of feedback and especially of quick
feedback. Even in this minimal example, we spent more time tweaking the code for the dialect
than we spent on writing it in the first place. Slow feedback loops kill performance, and if
you don’t believe me, find an online version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game">The Beer Distribution Game</a> and play it. You’ll be surprised.</p>

<p>The pinnacle of interactivity was, and still is, Smalltalk. I worked in that language for a
couple of years and having your system compile and run most of your tests in less than a second
is addictive. It is incredible how much your performance increases on a fully interactive
programming system but it takes first-hand experience to fully appreciate it. It’s a strange
system, a strange language, a tough sell; therefore Smalltalk is still in a very undeserved
state of limbo.</p>

<p>After my Smalltalk years, I met a lot of large Java systems. They started out as horrible
hairballs, but when the idea of “dependency injection” got a foothold, things started to get
better. Except for the return of the Job Control Language, this time disguised in XML and
carrying friendlier names like “Spring”. Internally, the code was reasonably clean and modular,
but telling the computer how to run it took pretty much the same amount of typing, this time
not in a programming language but in a structured markup language. That language lacked all
the facilities that apply to writing good code, so principles like “Don’t Repeat Yourself” went
overboard and copy/paste programming ensued. New business logic? New controller, twenty lines of
Java boilerplate, 10 lines of Java business logic, 50 lines of XML to wire it to the rest of
the system.</p>

<p>At least, in hindsight, XML was a blessing: your editor would tell you whether your “this is
how the code is wired up” description had the right structure, and later on even whether you
used names that existed in your Java codebase.</p>

<p>These systems took ages to compile, hours to run all the unit tests, and clearly interactivity
went down the drain. So “split it all up” was not a bad idea. It was an unnecessary idea, mostly
driven by the shortfalls of mainstream programming languages, but necessity is the mother of
invention - even though your average Java business app was much simpler than the Smalltalk
IDE before you added a single line of code to write your app, it was already too complex to
maintain and “divide and conquer” was the answer. Service Oriented Architecture, and later
microservices, was born. Split your codebase, split your teams, create a lot of opportunities
for mediocre coders to grow into mediocre engineering managers, everybody was happy. Including
your hardware vendor, because suddenly you needed much more hardware to run the same workloads. Because
networks are slow, and whereas it can be argued whether a three tier system is actually a distributed
computing system, a microservices system certainly qualifies for that label.</p>

<p>The return of the Job Control Language this time was in the form of,
again, configuration data on how to run your microservice. Microservices
were somewhat fatter than the very fine-grained objects of the old days,
so there was less of it, but still - it was there. The feedback cycle
became worse as well: in the monolith-with-XML days, your XML editor
would get you mostly there and a quick local compile and run would
leave you all but certain that your configuration was working.
XML, however, was universally rejected in favour of things like JSON, Yaml, HCL,
Toml - all free of structure, with zero indication whether a computer
would find your prose gibberish or the next Shakespeare play until
you actually pushed your code to some test cluster. It suddenly felt
a lot like being back at that university interacting with a mainframe,
but at least you still owned the hardware and could introspect all the
way down, especially if you were doing “DevOps” meaning mostly that you
had administrative access to your hardware.</p>

<p>Microservices have trouble scaling, and they are very complex. Most companies that employ them
have no need for them, but the systems and programming languages they employ are sufficiently
lacking that this stacking of complexity on top of complexity becomes a necessity. It seems that,
contrary to what everybody is saying, software developers are in plentiful and cheap supply so
wasting a lot of their talent makes economic sense over the perceived cost of adapting more
powerful programming systems. C’est la vie. The feedback cycle is truly broken - testing a
microservice is merely testing a cog in a machine and no guarantee that the cog will fit the
machine - but we just throw more bodies at the problem because Gartner tells us this is the future.</p>

<p>So, we’re now at the next phase of this game: maintaining these very complex systems is
hard and not your core business, so outsource it (simplifying it would cost too many managers’
jobs, so that is not an option). The Cloud was born, first as a marketing label for an old
business model (offering “virtual private servers” to the public), but more and more as a marketing
label for an even older business model (the mainframe - we run it, we own it, you lease capacity).</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">Worse Is Better</a> and you can do worse than Virtual Private Servers, so through a short-lived detour through
containerizing microservices and deploying them on a distributed scheduler like Mesos, Nomad,
or Kubernetes, we have arrived at “Serverless”. You deploy individual stateless functions. But
not inside a Java monolith, that is old, but on top of a distributed system. You would have been
laughed out of the door if you had proposed that in 2000, and you should be laughed out of the
door right now, but such is the power of marketing. So what have we now? A “mono repo” codebase,
because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment
descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called
“Function”, and instead
of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe. You
deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all
batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to
walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half
century. Oh, and a “Function”
will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed
a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew
can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.</p>

<p>History will repeat itself, of course. Conceptually, hiding a lot of the scaling and coordination
machinery is not a bad idea; programming systems like Erlang and OTP have shown for decades how
well that can work and Elixir is giving the platform a well-deserved surge in popularity. But there’s
a big difference here: a platform like OTP handles pretty much everything that a platform like
AWS Lambda handles, but it does it in a single programming language. Tools of the trade are
available: you can refactor Erlang code, you can write Elixir macros, all to keep the system
clean, malleable, and free of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">accidental complexity</a>.</p>

<p>It is called “Configuration as Code”, and it truly is a great idea (but hardly a new one). But XML
is not code, and neither is JSON, nor YAML, nor HCL. There is an essential quality lacking in all
of these markup languages, and that causes all the copy/paste programming I am currently seeing
everywhere, whether a …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

VisUAL has been developed as a cross-platform tool to make learning ARM Assembly language easier. In addition to emulating <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/supported_instructions.html">a subset of the ARM UAL instruction set</a>, it provides visualisations of key concepts unique to assembly language programming and therefore helps make programming ARM assembly more accessible.

</p><p>It has been designed specifically to use as a teaching tool for the <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering/internal/curriculumee2">Introduction to Computer Architecture course</a> taught at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Imperial College London.

</p>




<h2>Key Features</h2>



<h4>Navigate Program History</h4>

<p>In addition to stepping through code, users can navigate program history by browsing past register values. This feature can help debugging and understanding complex code easier.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/history_browsing.png" alt="history browsing"></p>



<h4>Pointer Visualisation</h4>

<p>Pointers in ARM assembly can be quite difficult to understand, especially since ARM assembly has 9 different variations of pointer behaviour when it comes to load/store instructions. VisUAL provides an information pane that displays useful pointer information when needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/pointer_visualisation.png" alt="pointer visualisation"></p>



<h4>Shift Operation Visualisation</h4>

<p>VisUAL can demonstrate shift operations by playing them as animations. The animations use actual data values from the shift instruction being demonstrated.</p>

  <source src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/shift_visualisation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video></p>



<h4>Memory Access Visualisation</h4>

<p>All memory access operations, word-aligned or byte-aligned,  can be visualised. Base and offset addresses are shown, and any values that have been changed are highlighted.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_visualisation.png" alt="memory visualisation"></p>



<h4>Stack Visualisation</h4>

<p>Instructions to load/store multiple instructions in the form of a stack can be visualised. Stack behaviour is described, and the stack as well as stack pointer at the start and end of the stack are displayed.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/stack_visualisation.png" alt="stack visualisation"></p>



<h4>Branch Visualisation</h4>

<p>Colour coded line highlights are used to indicate when a branch is being taken. For conditional instructions, status bits involved in condition checking are highlighted. An arrow points to the branch destination, acting as a visual cue to indicate a branch to another line of code is about to take place.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/branch_visualisation.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>



<h4>Subroutine Visualisation</h4>

<p>Whenever the link register is set to enter a subroutine, the linked subroutine return point will be highlighted and will remain highlighted until the subroutine exits.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/subroutine_visualisation.png" alt="subroutine visualisation"></p>



<h4>Error Correction Suggestions</h4>

<p>As opposed to providing cryptic compiler error messages, VisUAL provides context-specific error messages with explanations of exactly what is expected. In addition, whenever a runtime error occurs, the user is informed of the problematic instruction and what operation in the instruction resulted in the error.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/syntax_error.png" alt="syntax error"> <img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/runtime_error.png" alt="runtime error"></p>



<h4>Infinite Loop Detection</h4>

<p>Inadvertently typed code that may result in an infinite loop can cause code to malfunction. VisUAL detects possible infinte loops and prompts the user to select the appropriate response.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/infinite_loop_warning.png" alt="branch visualisation"></p>

<h4>View Memory Contents</h4>

<p>By using the view memory contents window, data defined in memory can be monitored in real-time as it changes. This allows fast debugging of memory access instructions from a static viewpoint in addition to the dynamic viewpoint provided by the pointer and memory access visualisations.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/memory_window.png" alt="memory contents window"></p>
    
<h4>View Symbols</h4>
    
<p>The symbols window provides a list of all code and data symbols that have been defined. This provides an easy method of lookup up symbols during execution.</p>

<p><img src="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/images/symbols_window.png" alt="view symbols window"></p>
    


<h4>Headless Emulation Mode</h4>

<p>VisUAL allows assembly code to be executed via the command line and logs the program state to an XML file. This is useful for power users for testing large batches of code. See the <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/logging_guide.html">logging guide</a> for details on how to use this.</p>

December 19, 2020 | https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>One of my goals for 2020 was to stop using Google's products. There are a lot of reasons why, but that's not the point of this post. I found out about Nextcloud last month and it turns out it's a great replacement for a lot of Google. I don't actually use all of its features, but I've migrated my calendar, reminders, contacts, bookmarks, video calls, photos, and news feeds and I'm really happy with it so far.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies that will host Nextcloud for you where you just sign up for an account like anything else, but in case you're interested in hosting Nextcloud for yourself this post is basically a brain dump of how I did that. It took me a while to cobble together all the pieces I needed to get everything working from end to end, so I'm hoping this might save someone else from having to do the same. If you know your way around servers and Nextcloud already you can just skim the headings like a checklist to make sure you don't forget an important step. But if you want a succinct overview of the actual steps I did and commands I ran, each section contains those details. By the end you'll see how I installed Nextcloud on my own server, secured it, set up backups, and set up external storage for my photos.</p>
<p>Some parts are pieced together from other partial guides or longer blog posts, so where relevant the references lead to those sources. This post is more of a quick start with just the essential steps. Anything in <code>&lt;pointy-brackets&gt;</code> is meant to be replaced. So the actual command I ran was e.g. <code>adduser kira</code>, not <code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2>What this list assumes you already have</h2>
<ul>
<li>A domain name. I got mine from <a href="https://namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>.</li>
<li>An account with a cloud server provider. I use <a href="https://www.linode.com/choosing-linode/">Linode</a>.</li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html">Backblaze</a></li>
<li>An account with <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">Healthchecks.io</a></li>
<li>Your ssh key</li>
<li>$75/year. I pay $5/month for the server I use, $5/year for the domain name ($5.16 actually), and CAD$10/year for carbon offsets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Set up a server running Ubuntu and set up ssh access for yourself</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spin up a new server with your cloud provider. I use a "nanode", the smallest server available from Linode, with 1GB of RAM and 25GB of storage, which is plenty more than <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/16/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#server">Nextcloud's minimum specs</a>.</li>
<li>Select an operating system that can install <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd">snap packages</a>. I'm using Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS). Nextcloud recommends at least either Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.</li>
<li>Add your ssh key to the server. There should be a way to do this through the UI where you manage your new server.</li>
<li>Copy the IP address of your new server</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.1. ssh into your server as the root user and make yourself a new sudo user that can also ssh into the machine <sup><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04">1</a></sup></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ssh <a href="https://kiramclean.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4e3c21213a0e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>adduser &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>usermod -aG sudo &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>rsync --archive --chown=&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt; ~/.ssh /home/&lt;name&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Close this ssh session and log in as your new user to make sure it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>logout</code></li>
<li><code>ssh &lt;name&gt;@&lt;server-ip-address&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave this ssh session open. The rest of the commands below are meant to be run on your server, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h2>2. Point your new server to your custom domain</h2>
<p>There should be a way to do this in the admin section for your server. On Linode's there's a "Domains" section in the left admin menu. From there I clicked "Add a Domain" in the top right, then filled in the domain name, my email address, and selected "Insert default records from one of my Linodes" from the "Insert Defaults Records" dropdown, then I selected my new Nextcloud server from the list of Linodes. The steps might be slightly different depending what cloud server provider you're using. By the end you need DNS records pointing your domain name to your Nextcloud server. If you did this through Linode (or whatever you're using), you'll also need to update the nameservers with your domain registar.</p>
<h2>3. Set up a basic firewall</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow OpenSSH</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow https</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw allow http</code></li>
<li><code>sudo ufw enable</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Install Nextcloud</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo snap install nextcloud</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.manual-install &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Set up your domain, enable https, and install an auto-updating certificate from Let's Encrypt</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=&lt;your-domain.name&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Enable 2FA on your Nextcloud account <sup>*</sup></h2>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your new personal cloud at the domain you configured using the username and password you chose above and install the 2FA app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner of the Nextcloud dashboard and select "Apps"</li>
<li>In the left side bar click on "Security", then search for the "Two-Factor TOTP Provider" app</li>
<li>Click "Download and enable"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up 2FA with this newly installed app
<ul>
<li>Click on your initial in the top right corner and select "Settings"</li>
<li>In the left sidebar, click on "Security" (in the "Personal" section) then check the "Enable TOTP" box and follow the instructions to set up 2FA</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I managed to forget my password in the time between installing Nextcloud and trying to log in for the first time. If that happens to you, you can reset it by running <code>sudo nextcloud.occ user:resetpassword &lt;username&gt;</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>* Doing this means you will be required to generate "app passwords" in order to log in to your Nextcloud account in third party apps or other devices (to use Nextcloud to sync your calendar or reminders to your phone, for example.) There's a tiny box with a button that says "Create new app password" at the bottom of the "Security" admin section (under "Personal", not "Administration") where you can do that.</small></p>
<h2>7. Set up backups</h2>
<h3>7.1. Turn on "local" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable backups for your whole server for a first layer of backups. I did this when I was setting up my Linode (there was a checkbox in the "Optional Add-ons" section for it). Otherwise there's a "Backups" tab in the admin section where you can turn them on. Linode charges $2/months for this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7.2. Set up "offsite" backups</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install and set up Backblaze</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a bucket in Backblaze for your backups</li>
<li>Make an app key with access to your backup bucket</li>
<li>Get the Backblaze cli and configure it
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code></li>
<li><code>sudo pip3 install b2</code></li>
<li><code>sudo b2 authorize_account &lt;keyID&gt;</code></li>
<li>Copy the key secret from the app key you just made to authorize the Backblaze cli</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new user to run the backups and disable password access for it, for security <sup><a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-backup-nextcloud/">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo adduser ncbackup</code></li>
<li><code>sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin ncbackup</code> <sup>*</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create directories for the backups and logs</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo mkdir -p /home/ncbackup/backups/logs</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the backup script and make it runnable <sup>**</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo touch /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code></li>
<li><code>sudo vim /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh</code> and copy the contents of the backup script below into your new file, or write your own that accomplishes the same things: <sup>***</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -e

DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')

# Output to a logfile
exec &amp;&gt; /home/ncbackup/backups/logs/${DATE}.txt

# Export all your config and data from Nextcloud
echo "Starting Nextcloud export..."
nextcloud.export
echo "Export complete"

# Compress backed up folder
echo "Compressing backup..."
tar -zcf /home/ncbackup/backups/${DATE}.tar.gz -C /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backups/ .
echo "Nextcloud backup successfully compressed to /home/ncbackup/backups"

# Remove uncompressed backup data
rm -rf /var/snap/nextcloud/common/backups/*

# Remove backups and logs older than 5 days
echo "Removing backups older than 5 days..."
find /home/ncbackup/backups -type f -mtime +5 -delete
find /home/ncbackup/backups/logs -type f -mtime +5 -delete

# Keep 14 days of backups in Backblaze
echo "Uploading to Backblaze..."
b2 sync --keepDays 14 --replaceNewer /home/ncbackup/backups b2://&lt;your-bucket-name&gt;
echo "Nextcloud backup completed successfully"
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Let the <code>ncbackup</code> user run the backup script as the root user
<ul>
<li><code>sudo visudo</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the end of the file that opens:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># Allow ncbackup to run script as sudo
ncbackup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>
<small>
* If you want to undo this for some reason you can run <code>sudo usermod -s /bin/bash ncbackup</code>
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
** Note this means you will have 6 copies of all your data on your server all the time -- 5 backups and the live versions. The backups are compressed, but it can still add up to a lot of space. Keep an eye on how much storage your server is using. Running it out of space will probably be one of the first issues you run into. I explain how to get notified when that's close to happening at the end.
</small>
</p>
<p>
<small>
*** You don't have to use vim here. Your server probably has nano installed or you can install the editor of your choice. To change the default editor on your server, run <code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor</code>, and choose the one you want.
</small>
</p>
<h2>8. Schedule and monitor your backups</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make yourself a healthcheck at <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">healthchecks.io</a> and copy the ping url</li>
<li><code>sudo crontab -u ncbackup -e</code></li>
<li>Copy this to the bottom of the file: <code>0 2 * * * sudo /usr/sbin/ncbackup.sh &amp;&amp; curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 -o /dev/null &lt;your-ping-url&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will run your backups once per day at 2am (in your server's timezone, probably UTC), but you can set whatever time and frequency you want, just remember to update your healthcheck to match.</p>
<h2>9. Test your backups</h2>
<p>Backups are only useful if you can use them to restore your data. Make sure yours work before you need them.</p>
<p>To test your entire server backups you can just try restoring the whole server using Linode's (or whoever's) UI. Testing the archived backups we uploaded to Backblaze is a little more involved but you'll be glad you know how to do it when you need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat steps 1-5, except you can just update the records for your domain that's already set up to point to your new server's IP address(es).</li>
<li>Download one of your backups</li>
<li>Copy the backup onto your new server. Run this in a terminal on your machine (not in an ssh session with a remote server):
<ul>
<li><code>scp /local/path/to/your/backup/ &lt;user&gt;@&lt;new-server-ip-address&gt;:~</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>ssh into your new server for the rest of these commands</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unzip, rename, and move the backup to a place where the Nextcloud snap installation will be able to access it, then make the root user the owner
<ul>
<li><code>tar -xvzf &lt;backup-name&gt;.tar.gz</code></li>
<li><code>sudo mv &lt;backup-data-dir&gt;/ …</code></li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

	<h2>Notes &amp; Descriptions</h2>
	<h3>Program Versions &amp; Sources</h3>
	<p>The emulation is running various versions of the original game, both from binaries copies of the original paper tapes and newly assembled from authentic code listings. The programs are loaded as virtual paper tapes (RIM-mode: Read In Memory) into the memory of the emulated DEC PDP-1.</p>
	<p><img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/hingham-space-warfare-2.png" alt="Spaceships (stylized) according to the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare" title="Spaceships according to the Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare" width="81" height="94"></p><p><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 3.1"><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong>, the final version of Spacewar! as left by the original programmers (Steve Russell and the other members of the <em>Hingham Institute Study Group on Space Warfare</em>), is presented here once in its original form and in a modified version showing scaled up graphics and effects for the benefit of small screen sizes. Further, there are both earlier and later versions, as <strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 2B"><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> (the program described in <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> by J. M. Graetz) and some examples of <strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to play Spacewar! 4.1f"><span></span>version 4</strong> (adding minor features and compatibility to an upgraded hardware). Finally, there is a special version of Spacewar 3.1, demonstrating the "Winds of Space" effect.</p>
	<p><em>(Please mind that the title screens are generated by the emulator and are not part of the original games.)</em></p>
	<p>There are two display resolutions to select from:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Low resolution</strong>, plotting at 512 x 512 px, 50% of the original display.<br>Special subpixel rendering is employed in order to boost the visible resolution beyond the physical resolution provided by the display element in the browser.<br>The result corresponds closely (if not being even a bit better) to the visual resolution of the original display: While the display featured a resolution of 1024 x 1024 plotting locations, only approximately 512 points on each axis were "resolvable to the unaided eye" <cite>(DP-35-2 / PDP-1 Instruction Manual / Part 3; DEC 1971; p. 5)</cite>.<br>Compare these contemporary photos: <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-1" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J.

	</ul>
	<p>Versions available (by the <i>"versions menu"</i> at the top left of the emulated display):</p>
	<ul>

		<li id="spacewar3.1"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1</strong> <span>(24 Sep 1962)</span><br>This could be regarded as the "standard version" of Spacewar!. The program is dated <em>"24 sep 62"</em> and is loaded from an authentic binary paper-tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">spacewar3.1_24-sep-62.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar3.1bigships');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 3.1, scaled ships</strong> <span>(low resolution only)</span><br>Scaled up graphics and effects to show the game in greater detail on a small display. (Colission radii and turning pivots of the ships have been adjusted accordingly.) This is quite similar to the presentation seen in other emulations. Please mind that the changes have minor effects on the gameplay.<br>
		The code is based on the original PDP-1 <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/_text/" target="_blank" title="Text-files in the archive of Steve Russell's box #1 at textfiles.com">assembler sources</a> by Steve Russell as available at <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a> and was modified and newly assembled in 2014. (N. Landsteiner, 2014; this is not an authentic version!)</li>

		<li id="spacewar2b"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar2b');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 2B</strong> <span>(2 Apr 1962)</span><br>This is the first complete version version of the game as presented at MIT's annual <em>Science Open House</em> in May 1962. Notably this is also the very version the background starfield (Peter Samson's <em>Expensive Planetarium</em>) was designed for, as this is annotated in the source code by <em>"stars by prs for s/w 2b"</em> and dated <em>"3/13/62, prs".</em> The program features the pre-particle-system "Crock Explosion" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-5" target="SpacewarOrigin" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig5.jpeg', 417, 422);} else { return true;}">[4]</a> and optionally a faster movement of the starfield (sense switch 4), torpedoes are single shot only (no salvoes). Some of the differences are more cosmetical: The ships' exhaust flames are half the size of later versions, also the display of the starfield hasn't found its final form yet (starting at an other position as compared to later versions). Moreover, the original starfield routine, found here, is modulating the varying brightnesses of the stars by how often the individual stars are drawn, whereas later versions are using the built-in intensity levels of the <em>Type 30 CRT</em> display instead.<br>For more on the making-of of Spacewar! see <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar" by J. M. Graetz</a>.<br>
		<span></span>The code is run from a binary paper tape image (RIM) labeled "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank" title="&quot;spaceWar_SA-5.bin&quot; in &quot;InsidePDP1_80s_box3&quot; at textfiles.com">spaceWar_SA-5.bin</a>". This has been proven to be identical to loading the two paper tapes "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20050823/" target="_blank" title="'spacewar2B_2apr62.bin' at textfiles.com">spacewar2B_2apr62.bin</a>" and "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/SteveRussell_box1/" target="_blank" title="'stars.bin' at textfiles.com">stars.bin</a>", both to be found at bitsavers.org.<br>
		(<em>"SA-5"</em> is not a version string, but indicates the program's start address being 5, which would start the program in a setup for reading the input from the console test switches rather than from MIT's special control boxes, as would be the case with the default start address. The label suggests that this was a tape sent from MIT to an other facility.)<br>
		Spacewar! 2B is known with a date as early as 25 March 1962. This earlier version shows minor differences regarding the polarity of the sense switch settings.<br>
		<img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/spacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.png" alt="Spacewar! — The Hyperspace Minskytron signature" title="The Minskytron signature effected by &quot;warp-induced photonic stress emission&quot;" width="75" height="105">
		<span></span>The program is presented here with two patches applied, namely the hyperspace-patch to include Martin Graetz's original hyperspace routine, the "<strong><a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/inside/insidespacewar-minskytron-hyperspace.html" target="_blank">Minskytron hyperspace</a></strong>" <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html#figure-4" target="_blank" title="Illustrative image in &quot;The Origin of Spacewar&quot; by J. M. Graetz" onclick="if (window.showEmbeddedImage) {return showEmbeddedImage('spacewar_origins/spacewar-fig4.jpeg', 419, 416);} else {return true;}">[5]</a> and its <em>"warp-induced photonic stress emission",</em> and the auto-restart patch for seemless playing. (There are exactly three jumps to hyperspace per player.)<br>
		This represents the the game as described and depicted in J.M. Graetz's seminal article <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/SpacewarOrigin.html" target="SpacewarOrigin">"The Origin of Spacewar"</a> and as presented at the <em>MIT Science Open House</em> in May 1962. (It still lacks a scorer-patch, which seems to be lost.)
		The patches are provided by the paper tape images "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">hyperspace85.bin</a>" <em>(Hyperspace VIci, 2 May 1962)</em> and  "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20030408/" target="_blank">spaceWarRstrt.bin</a>" — an other tape provides the same patch as "<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20031202/InsidePDP1_80s_box3/" target="_blank">spacewAutoRestartPatch.bin</a>". (The auto-restart patch was to be applied to the hyperspace-patch and is by this officially a patch to a patch. Thus, loading the full program had become a fairly complex affair then, involving up to 6 tapes.)<br>
		<span></span>Listings of Spacewar! 2B and the patches may be found <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/sources/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
		<span></span>Please mind that this is still the game early in development. The restart-patch is missing an edge case (pun in­tend­ed), where the ships would collide at the "antipode" in the corners of the display. The game requires a manual restart in this situation.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1f"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1f');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1f</strong> <span>(20 Feb 1963; mod. for CHM 2005 – 2008)</span><br>This is the version apparently running at the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> (CHM).<br>This is Spacewar! 4.1 modified by <strong>Peter Samson</strong> in 2005–2008 to include the <strong>scorer routine of Spacewar! 4.8</strong>. Moreover, version 4.1f features modified brightness settings for the background starfield (for use at the CHM), which are here remapped to usual values by the emulator. (Otherwise most of the stars would remain invisible.) Like other version of Spacewar! 4.x it requires the hardware multiply/divide option and features the single shot switch for torpedoes. The source code is dated <em>"spacewar 4.1  2/20/63 dfw"</em> and annotated <em>"mod for CHM, 2005-06-01 - 2005-11-28  --prs",</em> and <em>"changed delay in score display, 2008-08-22  --prs.".</em> The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/from_peter_samson/" target="_blank" title="Archive PDP-1 codes provided by Peter Samson at textfiles.com">sw41f.rim</a>) provided by Peter Samson via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.2"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.2a');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.2a (4.1/4.2 dfw)</strong> <span>(22 Feb 1963 ?)</span><br>This is an authentic representative of the 4.x-generation of Spacewar! (probably by "dfw", like version 4.1 above), requiring the hardware multiply/divide option of the PDP-1. Additionaly to some internal modifications it features, like all versions 4, a working single shot mode for torpedoes (sense switch 3). The code is run from a binary paper tape image (<a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040106/russell2/" target="_blank" title="Archive of Steve Russell's box #2 at textfiles.com">spacewar4.2a_sa4.bin</a>) provided by Steve Russell via <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.<br>A visually distinctive detail of versions 4.x (4.1 and later) is the <em>"Sun"</em> (heavy star), now drawn by a dashed line like the rocket blasts, thus separating it visually a bit more from the starships (see the <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/fullscreen.html#version=4.2a" title="Full-scale version of Spacewar! 4.2 emulated in HTML5/Javascript">high-res/full-scale version</a> for a close-up view.) Also, two ships colliding in free fall in the center will explode at the <em>"antipode"</em> rather than at the center as with earlier versions of the game.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.3"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.3');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.3</strong> <span>(17 May 1963)</span><br>This is a version by Monty Preonas (signing <em>"ddp"</em>), who also provided the adaptations for the automatic hardware multiply/divide option and the new gravity computations used by all flavors of Spacewar! 4 in his version 4.0 <em>(2 Feb 1962)</em> earlier.<br>
		Spacewar! 4.3 features, like Monty Preonas' flavor of version 4.2 and version 4.4 (also signed <em>"ddp",</em> but presumably by Joe Morris), a special <strong>on-screen score display</strong>, very much like the one of the 4.8-scorer-patch (see the note on scores below). Like all versions by Monty Preonas, it usues an implementation of the background starfield alike the one of Spacewar! 2B.<br>
		The game features a special <strong>Twin Star mode</strong> to be engaged by sense-switch 2 (accessible by the <em>options menu</em> <img src="https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/images/menubutton_small.png" width="20" height="16" alt="options menu icon" title="options menu icon"> at the top right corner of the screen). This visually distorted mode puts the <em>Needle</em> in the center of the screen in between a doubled sun and draws any other objects relatively to this ship. Moreover, some items are drawn at a double offset and torpedoes are displaced for real, resulting in a quite vexing game play. This mode was probably initially intended as an <em>ego view</em> from the <em>Needle's</em> perspective and left <em>as-is</em> as an amazing novelty. (Compare "Spacewar! 2015" below.)<br>
		<span></span>The program, dated <em>"5/17/63",</em> was newly assembled from source code provided in the assorted listings available at <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102664173" target="_blank" title="'Stars by prs for s/w 2b', CHM, catalog no. 102664173">CHM catalog no. 102664173</a> (which apparently came from Joe Morris, compare <cite><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.sys.pdp10/cNG89mmlbK0/V0JPyn3Mg7sJ" target="_blank">Joe Morris, alt.sys.pdp10, Jannuary 6, 2005</a></cite>).</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.8"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.8');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.8</strong> <span>(24 Jul 1963)</span><br>Apparently the final version of MIT-Spacewar!, dated <em>"7/24/63"</em> and signed <em>"dfw"</em>. A patch for a special <strong>on-screen scorer</strong> is available for this version (see the note on scoring below).<br>
		The game was newly assembled including the dedicated scorer patch. Sources <em>("spacewar4.8part1_engl.txt", "spacewar4.8part2_engl.txt", and "spacewar4.8_scorer.txt")</em> are available at <a href="http://textfiles.com/bitsavers/bits/DEC/pdp1/papertapeImages/20040817/" target="_blank" title="Spacewar 4.8! sources and sorer-patch at textfiles.com">textfiles.com</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/" target="_blank">bitsavers.org</a>.</li>

		<li id="spacewar4.1hafb"><strong onclick="selectSpacewarModule('spacewar4.1hafb');" data-title="Click to select this program."><span></span>Spacewar! 4.1 Holloman Air Force Base Version</strong><br>This is a reconstruction of a version of PDP-1 Spacewar! as seen at the Holloman Air Force Base (New Mexico) and described by John W. Andrews in December 1966 for "The Gamesman" (<a href="https://archive.org/details/The_Gamesman_4-1967-12/page/n31" target="_blank" title="Archived copy of The Gamesman, issue 4, Dec. 1967 (archive.org)">The Gamesman, Issue 4, Dec 1967, pp 30-32</a>). Altered starting positions are probably the most interesting feature of this version. (Controls have been swapped accordingly to accommodate for this.)<br>

  </div><div><p>A little over a month after releasing Bevy 0.3, and thanks to <strong>66</strong> contributors, <strong>178</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="wasm-webgl2">WASM + WebGL2</h2>

<p>Bevy now has a WebGL2 render backend! @mrk-its has been hard at work building the <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy_webgl2">Bevy WebGL2 Plugin</a> and expanding <code>bevy_render</code> to meet the needs of the web. He also put together a nice website showcasing various Bevy examples and games running on the web. </p>
<p>I think the results speak for themselves:</p>
<h3 id="bevy-webgl2-showcase"><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/">Bevy WebGL2 Showcase</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://mrk.sed.pl/bevy-showcase/"><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-4/webgl_showcase.png" alt="webgl2 showcase"></a></p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-main-function">Cross Platform Main Function</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>On most supported Bevy platforms you can just use normal main functions (ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web). Here is the smallest possible Bevy app that runs on those platforms:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However some platforms (currently Android and iOS) require additional boilerplate. This arcane magic is error prone, takes up space, and isn't particularly nice to look at. Up until this point, Bevy users had to supply their own boilerplate ... but no more! <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong> adds a new <code>#[bevy_main]</code> proc-macro, which inserts the relevant boilerplate for you. This is a big step toward our "write once run anywhere" goal.</p>
<p>This Bevy App has all the code required to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web:</p>
<pre><code><span>use </span><span>bevy</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::*;

#[</span><span>bevy_main</span><span>]
</span><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
    </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>();
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="live-shader-reloading">Live Shader Reloading</h2>
<p>authors: @yrns</p>
<p>Bevy can now update changes to shaders at runtime, giving you instant feedback without restarting your app. This video isn't sped up!</p>

<h2 id="ecs-improvements">ECS Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a Bevy update without another round of ECS improvements!</p>
<h3 id="flexible-ecs-parameters">Flexible ECS Parameters</h3>
<p>Prior versions of Bevy forced you to provide system parameters in a specific order:</p>
<pre><code><span>/// This system followed the [Commands][Resources][Queries] order and compiled as expected
</span><span>fn </span><span>valid_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) {
}

</span><span>/// This system did not follow the required ordering, which caused compilation to fail
</span><span>fn </span><span>invalid_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Newbies would fall prey to this constantly. These completely arbitrary constraints were a quirk of the internal implementation. The <code>IntoSystem</code> trait was only implemented for specific orders. Supporting every order would have exponentially affected compile times. The internal implementation was also constructed with a <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/9afe196f1690a6a6e47bf67ac740b4edeffd97bd/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/into_system.rs#L158">famously complicated macro</a>.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I completely rewrote how we generate systems. We now use a <code>SystemParam</code> trait, which we implement for each parameter type. This has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Significantly Faster Compile Times</strong>: We're seeing a <b>~25%</b> decrease in clean compile times</li>
<li><strong>Use Any Parameter Order You Want</strong>: No more arbitrary order restrictions!</li>
<li><strong>Easily Add New Parameters</strong>: It is now easy for us (and for users) to create new parameters. Just implement the <code>SystemParam</code> trait!</li>
<li><strong>Simpler Implementation</strong>: The new implementation is much smaller and also way easier to maintain and understand.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span>// In Bevy 0.4 this system is now perfectly valid. Cool!
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>commands</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Commands, </span><span>time</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Time</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that in <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, commands now look like <code>commands: &amp;mut Commands</code> instead of <code>mut commands: Commands</code>. </p>
<h3 id="simplified-query-filters">Simplified Query Filters</h3>
<p>Up until now, Bevy's Query filters were intermingled with components:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B, </span><span>(&amp;</span><span>Transform, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Confused? You wouldn't be the first! You can interpret the query above as "give me immutable references to the <code>Transform</code> and <code>Velocity</code> components of all entities that have the <code>A</code> component, <em>do not</em> have the <code>B</code> component, and have a changed Velocity component".</p>
<p>First, the nesting of types via With / Without makes it very unclear whats going on. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> parameter does. Is it just a filter? Does it also return a Velocity component? If so, is it immutable or mutable?</p>
<p>It made sense to break up these concepts. In <strong>Bevy 0.4</strong>, Query filters are separate from Query components. The query above looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Query with filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, </span><span>(</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;)&gt;) {
}

</span><span>// Query without filters
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This makes it much easier to tell what a Query is doing at a glance. It also makes for more composable behaviors. For example, you can now filter on <code>Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;</code> without actually retrieving the <code>Velocity</code> component.</p>
<p>And now that filters are a separate type, you can create type aliases for filters that you want to re-use:</p>
<pre><code><span>type </span><span>ChangedVelocity </span><span>= (</span><span>With</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Without</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;, </span><span>Changed</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>&gt;);

</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>Transform, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Velocity</span><span>)</span><span>, ChangedVelocity</span><span>&gt;) {
}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="system-inputs-outputs-and-chaining">System Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining</h3>
<p>Systems can now have inputs and outputs. This opens up a variety of interesting behaviors, such as system error handling:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>main</span><span>() {
  </span><span>App</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>()
    .</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>result_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>().</span><span>chain</span><span>(</span><span>error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>()))
    .</span><span>run</span><span>();
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>result_system</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt; {
  </span><span>let</span><span> transform </span><span>=</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>SOME_ENTITY</span><span>)?;
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>found entity transform: {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>);
  </span><span>Ok</span><span>(())
}

</span><span>fn </span><span>error_handler_system</span><span>(</span><span>In</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>)</span><span>: In</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;()&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>error_handler</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MyErrorHandler</span><span>&gt;) {
  </span><span>if let </span><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>) =</span><span> result </span><span>{
</span><span>      error_handler</span><span>.</span><span>handle_error</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>);
  }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.System.html"><code>System</code>
</a> trait now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Has no inputs and no outputs
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>()</span><span>, Out = </span><span>()&gt;

</span><span>// Takes a usize as input and return a f32
</span><span>System</span><span>&lt;</span><span>In = </span><span>usize</span><span>, Out = </span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>We use this feature in our new Schedule implementation.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-v2">Schedule V2</h3>
<p>Bevy's old Schedule was nice. System registrations were easy to read and easy to compose. But it also had significant limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one Schedule allowed</li>
<li>Very static: you were limited to using the tools we gave you:
<ul>
<li>stages are just lists of systems</li>
<li>stages are added to schedules</li>
<li>stages use hard-coded system runners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Couldn't switch between schedules at runtime</li>
<li>Couldn't easily support "fixed timestep" scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve these problems, I wrote a new Schedule system from scratch. Before you get worried, these are largely <em>non-breaking</em> changes. The high level "app builder" syntax you know and love is still available:</p>
<pre><code><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>add_system</span><span>(</span><span>my_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-trait">Stage Trait</h4>
<p>Stages are now a trait. You can now implement your own <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.Stage.html"><code>Stage</code>
</a> types!</p>
<pre><code><span>struct </span><span>MyStage</span><span>;

</span><span>impl </span><span>Stage </span><span>for </span><span>MyStage </span><span>{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>world</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> World, </span><span>resources</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Resources</span><span>) {
        </span><span>// Do stage stuff here.
        // You have unique access to the World and Resources, so you are free to do anything
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-type-systemstage">Stage Type: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.SystemStage.html"><code>SystemStage</code></a></h4>
<p>This is basically a "normal" stage. You can add systems to it and you can decide how those systems will be executed (parallel, serial, or custom logic)</p>
<pre><code><span>// runs systems in parallel (using the default parallel executor)
</span><span>let</span><span> parallel_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());

</span><span>// runs systems serially (in registration order)
</span><span>let</span><span> serial_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>serial</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());

</span><span>// you can also write your own custom SystemStageExecutor
</span><span>let</span><span> custom_executor_stage </span><span>=
    </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>MyCustomExecutor</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>());
</span></code></pre><h4 id="stage-type-schedule">Stage Type: <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.Schedule.html"><code>Schedule</code></a></h4>
<p>You read that right! <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.Schedule.html"><code>Schedule</code>
</a> now implements the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/trait.Stage.html"><code>Stage</code>
</a> trait, which means you can nest Schedules within other schedules: </p>
<pre><code><span>let</span><span> schedule </span><span>= </span><span>Schedule</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>()
    .</span><span>with_stage</span><span>("</span><span>update</span><span>", </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()

        .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
    )
    .</span><span>with_stage</span><span>("</span><span>nested</span><span>", </span><span>Schedule</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>()
        .</span><span>with_stage</span><span>("</span><span>nested_stage</span><span>", </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>serial</span><span>()
            .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
        )
    );
</span></code></pre><h4 id="run-criteria">Run Criteria</h4>
<p>You can add "run criteria" to any <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.SystemStage.html"><code>SystemStage</code>
</a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/struct.Schedule.html"><code>Schedule</code>
</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>// A "run criteria" is just a system that returns a `ShouldRun` result

    )
</span></code></pre><h4 id="fixed-timestep">Fixed Timestep</h4>
<p>You can now run stages on a "fixed timestep".</p>
<pre><code><span>// this stage will run once every 0.4 seconds
</span><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>add_stage_after</span><span>(</span><span>stage</span><span>::</span><span>UPDATE</span><span>, "</span><span>fixed_update</span><span>", </span><span>SystemStage</span><span>::</span><span>parallel</span><span>()

    .</span><span>with_system</span><span>(</span><span>my_system</span><span>.</span><span>system</span><span>())
)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This builds on top of <code>ShouldRun::YesAndLoop</code>, which ensures that the schedule continues to loop until it has consumed all accumulated time.</p>

<p>Now that stages can be any type, we need a way for <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_app/latest/bevy_app/trait.Plugin.html"><code>Plugins</code>
</a> to interact with arbitrary stage types:</p>
<pre><code><span>app

AMA, largest U.S. medical professional group, called for increased regulatory oversight in 2009 and 2011.

Each gland produces one or more hormones that are released into the bloodstream. When they reach a target organ, they bind to specific receptors, triggering a response. Hormones are critical to reproductive function and are essential to normal development of the body and brain. The glands must be able to adjust hormone release in response to the changing environment to enable a healthy life.</p><h3 id="chart-production-of-selected-chemicals-and-plastics-in-the-united-states-in-2019-by-type">Chart: Production of selected chemicals and plastics in the United States in 2019, by type</h3><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-19-at-9.44.32-PM.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: American Chemistry Council; US Census Bureau; US International Trade Commission; ICIS; Chemical Week; AFPM; TFI</figcaption></figure><p>The Endocrine Society described EDCs as an exogenous [non-natural] chemical, or mixture of chemicals, that interferes with any aspect of hormone action Today, a vast number of chemicals generated are in use.

<p>I was recently reading the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/huawei-cyber-security-evaluation-centre-oversight-board-annual-report-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 UK government security evaluation of Huawei</a> which provides a humorous example: developers for one of the LTE base stations literally used a <code>#define</code> to redefine unsafe_functions like <code>strcpy</code> to safer varients like <code>strlcpy</code>.

<p><em><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790270/HCSEC_OversightBoardReport-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report from the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board</a>, page 29, March 2019</em></p>
<p>In net, the report found that about 11% of <code>memcpy</code>-like and 22% of <code>strcpy</code>-like function calls in the codebase were to the least safe variants. And assuming safety just from the function name is simplistic—even the <em>safe</em> variants could still be dangerous.</p>
<p>In Huawei’s defense, while they have been subjected to an unusual level of public scrutiny they are definitely not an outlier in having trouble getting developers to adopt secure coding guidelines. In the <code>memcpy</code> case, it’s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090519182728/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288454.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned at Microsoft</a> <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/05/15/microsoft_banishes_memcpy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2009</a>, but I haven’t personally seen any other companies outside the FAANG (Facebook/Apple/Amazon/Netflix/Google) that have done the same. You can actually tell who has banned the bad POSIX functions empirically, by looking at binaries—a non-profit named CITL did a great overview of this and more in the IoT space. As you’d probably guess, the <a href="https://cyber-itl.org/2019/08/26/iot-data-writeup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">results are dismal</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/clintgibler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Gibler</a> and I <a href="https://r2c.dev/global-appsec-sf-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently presented</a> at Global AppSec SF 2020 about what we think are some of the core principles for successfully bridging the developer/security divide. If you’re looking for a quick takeaway, we suggest three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be fast: scanning should run in parallel and be <em>faster than the slowest test</em>. Otherwise you’re blocking developer workflow.</li>
<li>Be early: if you’re going to complain, the editor is better than commit-time is better than CI.</li>
<li>Autofix: don’t just complain, offer a fix. Even an imperfect suggestion is better than nothing.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>P.S. If you have a giant C codebase sitting around and you want to figure out how much <code>strcpy</code> is used, the two fastest ways are probably <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripgrep, a hyper-fast grep</a> (noisy, fastest) or <a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep, a semantic grep-for-code</a> (precise, slower; full disclosure—I work on Semgrep!). Here’s how you could do it in both:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ rg --quiet --stats strcpy -tc
<span>163</span> matches
<span>..</span>.</code></pre></div>
<p>But ripgrep includes some false positives, like commented code:</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>45</span>:// string.h is not guaranteed to provide strcpy on C++ Builder.</code></pre></div>
<p>We could obviously try to improve our regex to avoid <code>//</code> at the start of the line, but then we’d have to consider <code>/*</code> also, plus a lot more if we really want to do it right, so it might be nice to have a proper parser, which is what Semgrep provides. If you’re curious about the syntax, there’s an <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online tutorial</a> that takes a few minutes or you can <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the docs</a>.</p>
<div data-language="shell"><pre><code><span>(</span>webkit@aadf31<span>)</span> $ semgrep -e <span>"memcpy(...)"</span> --lang<span>=</span>c <span>.</span>
<span>..</span>.
ran <span>1</span> rules on <span>1710</span> files: <span>80</span> findings</code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that Semgrep has some parse failures on Webkit; <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C support is still in alpha</a>)</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>At Shopify we aim to make what most merchants need easy, and the rest possible. We make the rest possible by exposing interfaces to query, extend and alter our Platform. These interfaces empower a rich ecosystem of Partners to solve a variety of problems. The primary mechanism of this ecosystem is an “App”, an independently hosted web service which communicates with Shopify over the network. This model is powerful, but comes with a host of technical issues. Partners are stretched beyond their available resources as they have to build a web service that can operate at Shopify’s scale. Even if Partners’ resources were unlimited, the network latency incurred when communicating with Shopify precludes the use of Apps for time sensitive use cases.</p>
<p>We want Partners to focus on using their domain knowledge to solve problems, and not on managing scalable web services. To make this a reality we’re keeping the flexibility of untrusted Partner code, but executing it on our own infrastructure. We choose a universal format for that code that ensures it’s performant, secure, and flexible: WebAssembly.</p>

<p>What is WebAssembly? According to <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" title="WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WebAssembly.org</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.”</p>
<p>To learn more, see this series of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/a-cartoon-intro-to-webassembly/" target="_blank" title="A cartoon intro to WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">illustrated articles written by Lin Clark of Mozilla</a> with information on WebAssembly and its history.</p>
<p>Wasm is often presented as a performant language that runs alongside JavaScript from within the Browser. We, however, execute Wasm outside of the browser and with no Javascript involved. Wasm, far from being solely a Javascript replacement, is designed for <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/non-web/" target="_blank" title="Non-Web Embeddings - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Web and Non-Web Embeddings alike</a>. It solves the more general problem of performant execution in untrusted environments, which exists in browsers and code execution engines alike. Wasm satisfies our three main technical requirements: security, performance, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Executing untrusted code is a dangerous thing—it's exceptionally difficult to predict by nature, and it has potential to cause harm to Shopify’s platform at large. While no application is entirely secure, we need to both prevent security flaws and mitigate their impacts when they occur.</p>
<p>Wasm executes within a sandboxed stack-based environment, relying upon explicit imports to allow communication with the host. Because of this, you cannot <strong>express</strong> anything malicious in Wasm. You can only express manipulations of the virtual environment and use provided imports. This differs from bytecodes which have references to the computers or operating systems they expect to run on built right into the syntax.</p>
<p>Wasm also hosts a number of features which protect the user from buggy code, including protected call stacks and runtime type checking. <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/" target="_blank" title="Security - WebAssembly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">More details on the security model of Wasm can be found on WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In ecommerce, speed is a competitive advantage that merchants need to drive sales. If a feature we deliver to merchants doesn’t come with the right tradeoff of load times to customization value, then we may as well not deliver it at all.</p>
<p>Wasm is designed to leverage common hardware capabilities that provide it near native performance on a wide variety of platforms. It’s used by a community of performance driven developers looking to optimize browser execution. As a result, Wasm and surrounding tooling was built, and continues to be built, with a performance focus.</p>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>A code execution service is only as useful as the developers using it are productive. This means providing first class development experiences in multiple languages they’re familiar with. As a bytecode format, Wasm is targeted by a number of different compilers. This allows us to support multiple languages for developer use without altering the underlying execution model.</p>
<h2>Community Driven</h2>
<p>We have a fundamental alignment in goals and design, which provides our “engineering reason” for using Wasm. But there’s more to it than that—it’s about the people as well as the technology. If nobody was working on the Wasm ecosystem, or even if it was just on life support in its current state, <strong>we wouldn’t use it</strong>. WebAssembly is an energized community that’s constantly building new things and has a lot of potential left to reach. By becoming a part of that community, Shopify stands to gain significantly from that enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We’re also contributing to that enthusiasm ourselves. We’re collecting user feedback, discussing feature gaps, and most importantly contributing to the open source tools we depend on. We think this is the start of a healthy reciprocal relationship between ourselves and the WebAssembly community, and we expect to expand these efforts in the future.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve covered WebAssembly and why we’re using it, let’s move onto how we’re executing it.</p>
<p>We use an open source tool called <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime" target="_blank" title="Announcing Lucet: Fastly’s native WebAssembly compiler and runtime" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lucet</a> (originally written by Fastly). As a company, Fastly provides a programmable edge cloud platform. They’re trying to bring execution of high-volume, short-lived, and untrusted modules closer to where they’re being requested. This is the same as the problem we’re trying to solve with our Partner code, so it’s a natural fit to be using the same tools.</p>
<h3>Lucet</h3>
<p>Lucet is both a runtime and a compiler for Wasm. Modules are represented in Wasm for the safety that representation provides. Recall that you can’t <em>express</em> anything malicious in Wasm. Lucet takes advantage of this and uses a validation of the Wasm module as a security check. After the validation, the module is compiled to an executable artifact with near bare metal performance. It also supports ahead of time compilation, allowing us to have these artifacts ready to execute at runtime. Lucet containers boast an impressive startup time of <em>35&nbsp;</em><em><span>μs</span></em>. That’s because it’s a container that doesn’t need to do anything at all to start up.&nbsp; If you want the full picture, Tyler McMullan, the CTO of Fastly, did a great talk which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdWaQOgvd-g" target="_blank" title="Lucet: Safe WebAssembly Outside the Browser by Tyler McMullen" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gives an overview of Lucet and how it works</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="A flow diagram showing how Shopify uses our Wasm engine: Lucet wrapped within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-diagram-shopify-wasm-engine.jpg?v=1608224390">
<figcaption>A flow diagram showing Shopify's Wasm engine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We wrap Lucet within a Rust web service which manages the I/O and storage of modules, which we call the Wasm Engine. This engine is called by Shopify during a runtime process, usually a web request, in order to satisfy some function. It then applies the output in context of the callsite. This application could involve the creation of a discount, the enforcement of a constraint, or any form of synchronous behaviour Merchants want to customize within the Platform.</p>
<h3>Execution Performance</h3>
<p>Here’s some metrics pulled from a recent performance test. During this test, 100k modules were executed per minute for approximately 5 min. These modules contained a trivial implementation of enforcing a limit on the number of items purchased in a cart.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showcasing the time taken to execute a module. The x axis representing the time over the test was running and the y axis is the time represented in ms" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Lucet-module-execution.jpg?v=1608225321">
<figcaption>Time taken to execute a module</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates a breakdown of the time taken to execute a module, including I/O with the container and the execution of the module. The y-axis is time in ms, the x-axis is the time over which the test was running.</p>
<p>The light purple bar shows the time taken to execute the module in Lucet, the width of which hovers around 100 μs. The remaining bars deal with I/O and engine specifics, and the total time of execution is around 4 ms. All times are 99th percentiles (p99).To put these times in perspective, let’s compare these times to the request times of <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite" target="_blank" title="How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Storefront Renderer, our performant Online Store rendering service</a>:</p>
<figure><img alt="A line graph showing Storefront Renderer Response time" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-Renderer-Response-Times.jpg?v=1608300459">
<figcaption>Storefront Renderer response time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This chart demonstrates the request time to Storefront Renderer over time. The y-axis is request time in seconds. The x-axis is the time over which the values were retrieved. The light blue line representing the 99th percentile hovers around 700 ms.</p>
<p>Then if we consider the time taken by our module execution process to be generally under 5 ms, we can say that the performance impact of Lucet execution is negligible.</p>
<h2>Generating WebAssembly</h2>
<p>To get value out of our high performance execution engine, we’ll need to empower developers to create compatible Wasm modules. Wasm is primarily intended as a compilation target, rather than something you write by hand (<a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html" target="_blank" title="Writing WebAssembly By Hand" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">though you can write Wasm by hand</a>). This leaves us with the question of what languages we’ll support and to what extent.</p>
<p>Theoretically any language with a Wasm target can be supported, but the effort developers spend to conform to our API is better focused on solving problems for merchants. That’s why we’ve chosen to provide first class support to a single language that includes tools that get developers up and running quickly.At Shopify, our language of choice is Ruby. However, because Ruby is a dynamic language, we can’t compile it down to Wasm directly. We explored solutions involving compiling interpreters, but found that there was a steep performance penalty. Because of this, we decided to go with a statically compiled language and revisit the possibility of dynamic languages in the future.</p>
<p>Through our research we found that developers in our ecosystem were most familiar with Javascript. Unfortunately, Javascript was precluded as it’s a dynamic language like Ruby. Instead, we chose a language with familiar TypeScript-like syntax called <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/" target="_blank" title="AssemblyScript" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AssemblyScript</a>.</p>
<h2>Using AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>At first glance, there are a huge number of languages that support a WebAssembly target. Unfortunately, there are two broad categories of WebAssembly compilers which we can’t use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilers that generate environment or language specific artifacts, namely node or the browser. (Examples: <a href="https://github.com/tweag/asterius" target="_blank" title="Asterius: A Haskell to WebAssembly compiler" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Asterius</a>, <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank" title="Blazor Build client web apps with C#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Blazor</a>)</li>
<li>Compilers that are designed to work only with a particular Runtime. The modules generated by these compilers rely upon special language specific imports. This is often done to support a language’s standard library, which expects certain system calls or runtime features to be available. Since we don’t want to be …</li></ul></div></div>

  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-flute.jpg" alt="Pytest Flute" title="Pytest Flute">

  <p>I occasionally enjoy solving algorithmic problems, for example <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">The Advent of Code</a>.
I’ve been doing them since I was a pimply PHP-slinging teenager, competing with my peers across the UK in the British Informatics Olympiad.
It was terribly nerdy and terribly fun.</p>

<p>Algorithmic problems are often used in technical interviews, which I find less fun.
Strict deadlines stress me out.</p>

<p>In either case, using automated tests makes these problems way easier.
I wish I knew this earlier!</p>

<p>Online algorithmic platforms, such as <a href="https://codility.com/">Codility</a>, provide their own automated tests.
You use these for basic validation on some examples, but edge cases are sneakily reserved for final marking.
To ensure your solution covers all the bases, you need to write your own tests.</p>

<p>In Python, there’s no better test framework than <a href="https://pytest.org/">Pytest</a> - I use it on all my open source projects.
It makes it easy for you to add tests for any Python code.
And it’s much better than Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>unittest</code> is an old horse and cart, while <code>pytest</code> is the batmobile.</p>

<p><img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-pytest.png" alt="Pytest homepage"></p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a small problem together using Pytest.
Here’s the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function <code>solve(items)</code> that takes <code>items</code>, a list of integers, and returns the smallest integer greater than 0 that appears in the list, or 0 if there is none.</p>

  <p>For example <code>solution([1, 2])</code> should return 1, and <code>solution([-1])</code> should return 0.</p>

  <p>The list <code>items</code> will contain up to 1,000,000 integers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let’s write the most basic sketch of a <code>solve</code> function.
Since 0 is a default value to return, if we always return that we can score some easy points.
Create a file called <code>example.py</code> with the contents:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s test the function manually by running it in the Python 3 interpreter. Open the command line and run the examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 14 2019, 21:08:36)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from example import solve
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([1, 2])
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([-1])
0</code></pre></figure>

<p>So we failed on the first example, but succeeded with the second.</p>

<p>Doing this each time we modify the code would get tiresome quickly.
We have to restart the interpreter, rerun the import and tests, and manually compare the outputs.
Writing automated tests now, before we’ve tried to solve the problem properly, makes the whole loop faster.
It also makes us think about all the cases up front.</p>

<p>Let’s write the tests and solve the problem with the <strong>Red, Green, Refactor</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="red">Red</h3>

<p>First, let’s add tests that fail.</p>

<p>Pytest can work with tests in the same file as our code, as simple functions with names starting <code>test_</code>.
We use Python’s <code>assert</code> statement to compare the results of our code with our expectations.</p>

<p>Add tests for the two examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_1</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_2</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then install Pytest and run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python -m pip install pytest

E        +  where 0 = solve([1, 2])

example.py:5: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.03 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the middle of the output, we see the tests in <code>example.py</code> running.
Pytest outputs an <code>F</code> for the failing test, and a dot <code>.</code> for the passing one.</p>

<p>The <code>FAILURES</code> section expands on the failure with the line that failed.
It then shows that <code>solve([1, 2])</code> returned <code>0</code> which doesn’t compare equal to the expected value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The tests we have are a start but they don’t cover all the cases.
We don’t have any lists that contain <code>0</code>.
Also two extremes are missing: the empty list and a list of 1,000,000 items.
Long lists could also contain lots of negative or positive integers, so we should try both of these.</p>

<p>Let’s add more tests.
We can make a list of 1,000,000 items in Python by multiplying a short list.
Add these tests at the end of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_empty_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>

<p>Run them again:</p>

<p>There are more failures - which is good!</p>

<h3 id="green">Green</h3>

<p>Now we can work to a solution that makes all the tests pass.
Replace <code>solve</code> with this first attempt:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================

example.py:30: AssertionError
====================== 2 failed, 4 passed in 0.17 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>We have two different failures now.
It seems we have yet to ignore negative numbers, woops!</p>

<p>Modify the solution to do so, by adding the <code>i &gt; 0</code> condition:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>):</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="collected">def solve(items):
    return min((i for i in items if i &gt; 0), default=0)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-running the tests produces the same, all-passing output as above.
Yay, we got the code down to one line!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.</p>
<p>A while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string "VMWare" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information. </p>
<p>Once I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper <a href="http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf">[1]</a> related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.</p>
<p>The end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.</p>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>Now that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info">[2]</a> can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'webgl'</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>debugInfo</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getExtension</span><span>(</span><span>'WEBGL_debug_renderer_info'</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>vendor</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_VENDOR_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>renderer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getParameter</span><span>(</span><span>debugInfo</span><span>.</span><span>UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>vendor</span><span>);</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>renderer</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, extension availability can be queried using the <strong><em>getExtension</em></strong> method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from <a href="https://webglreport.com/">[3]</a> WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="alt-text" src="https://bannedit.github.io/resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png" title="VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com">
<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>width</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>height</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>color_depth</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>colorDepth</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>bitspp</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>pixelDepth</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details on the screen object can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_screen.asp">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Can we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/">[6]</a></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>ram</span> <span>=</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>deviceMemory</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the <a href="https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/">[7]</a> Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past. Core Estimator also provides the Javascript libraries on github <a href="https://github.com/oftn-oswg/core-estimator">[8]</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues. </p>
