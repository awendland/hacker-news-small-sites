<p>Often times, when you want to compare two videos side-by-side or you want to create an effect during post-processing, you might want to stack videos together. It can get expensive if you end up buying a tool to do this, but, guess what? </p>



<p><strong>FFmpeg offers a variety of tools to help stack videos together – horizontally, vertically, or in a grid fashion. In this tutorial, let’s learn about FFmpeg’s <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters for stacking videos. </strong></p>



<hr>




<h2><span id="How_to_Stack_Videos_Horizontally_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>How to Stack Videos Horizontally using FFmpeg?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Horizontally stacking videos” refers to placing videos side-by-side (one on the left and the other on the right). </p>



<p>Before you do this, there are a couple of points that you need to consider. </p>



<ol><li>The videos that you want to stack need to have the same height. </li><li> The videos need to have the same pixel format. </li></ol>



<p>The command line is shown below where we try and stack two <code>mp4</code> videos. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex hstack=inputs=2 horizontal-stacked-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The <code>hstack</code> filter has a simple format. You need to specify the number of inputs and it parses that from the beginning portion of the commandline. The order of stacking follows the order of inputs. </p>



<p>Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4FwbqByqDpDpOGTNvpSWSOh6RVE9yzesrQyAyGvaOF1ZjVsycKOlQUjrTmdJRFJWblHjC9gF6zMds0s5w2Yy2w6CVXXme-H-zF8nYoJ496khN0aHXHaWbnwEe41BYmu6c2mdoQb8" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>And, here is a video! </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731721" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Here is another use case. Companies or teams working on video compression often like to compare videos side-by-side in the lab or showcase their work in conferences. FFmpeg’s horizontal stacking is an easy way to do this and achieve a very good result. </p>



<p>Below are two videos encoded at different video quality settings and stacked horizontally. Comparison made simple, right? <em>(note: Vimeo’s choise of bitrate might mess with the comparison, but, when done offline (downloaded), the <code>hstack</code> filter makes comparisons easy!)</em></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476095363" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_Vertically_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>Stacking Videos Vertically using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>“Vertically stacked videos” results in placing videos one below the other. Unlike in horizontal stacking, inputs need to be having the same width. The command is as shown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For vertical stacking, we need to use the <code>vstack</code> filter whose syntax is similar to the <code>hstack</code> filter we used in the previous horizontal stacking example.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4&nbsp;-filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 vertical-stack-output.mp4</code></pre>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qtyxioWFR54pqwZhX7jgX6HkSG7gCw840GdK78HGHHP7X3sv3fr3Pou9hOMFu2O-e6O7nmCith3U6CM1SpDanhwmIFIBzZUQyaG4T0BJaF9QCdMIPrmMmH0qc9WTK5f-5Nf4-92y" alt="stack videos using ffmpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Both functions pretty much use the same commands with a simple distinction, the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>hstack</code></a> and the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>vstack</code></a> under the <code>-filter_complex</code> argument.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a video of stacking two videos vertically using FFmpeg. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731607" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths"></span><strong>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Well, there’s a really nifty ability for both of these to prioritize the length of the shortest video. And as luck would have it the parameter is named <code>shortest</code>, and it’s applicable to both the horizontal and vertical stacking filters. Using <code>shortest=1</code> ensures the shortest length is used. </p>



<p>For example – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -filter_complex hstack=inputs=2:shortest=1 shortest-output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>As a <b>side note</b>, if you run into an error that claims frames are being duplicated, the easiest workaround is to slip the <code>vsync 2</code> parameter into your command, and it worked like a charm.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_Without_the_shortest_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths Without the <code>shortest</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>To test what happens in this situation, let’s stack two videos vertically – a 10 second clip and an 18 second clip. You’ll see that the shorter clip just stops after it completes, but the output video continues till the longest of the input clips complete.  </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731684" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>











<p>If you want to truncate the clips to the length of the shortest clip, then you need to use the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter. Let’s look at that in the next section.</p>



<h3><span id="Stacking_Videos_of_Different_Lengths_With_the_shortest=1_parameter"></span>Stacking Videos of Different Lengths With the <code>shortest=1</code> parameter<span></span></h3>



<p>In this example, we use the <code>shortest=1</code> command-line parameter and as you can see, the length of the final video is truncated to the length of the shortest of the inputs. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475731643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="2%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong><strong>2×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong></strong><span></span></h2>



<p>We can achieve a 2×2 grid of videos using a combination of the <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. Let’s start by looking at the command-line and then break it down. It’s actually pretty simple! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 -i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]; \
[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]; \
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p>What’s happening here?</p>



<ul><li>firstly, you need to provide 4 input videos with the same height and width</li><li>next, you stack the first two videos horizontally and call it “top” i.e. <code>[0:v][1:v]hstack=inputs=2[top]</code></li><li>then, you you stack the next two videos horizontally and call it “bottom” i.e. <code>[2:v][3:v]hstack=inputs=2[bottom]</code></li><li>then, you stack <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> vertically to create a 2×2 grid. — <code>[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]</code></li><li>then using the <code>map</code> command, we can extract and push the video track to the output container. </li></ul>



<p>Here is what the video looks like. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475771172" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="3%C3%972_Grid_of_Videos_using_FFmpeg"></span><strong>3×2 Grid of Videos using FFmpeg</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Along the same lines, here is a 3×2 grid of videos using <code>hstack</code> and <code>vstack</code> filters. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i input0.mp4 -i input1.mp4 \
-i input2.mp4 -i input3.mp4 \
-i input4.mp4 -i input5.mp4 \
-filter_complex \
"[0:v][1:v][2:v]hstack=inputs=3[top];\
[3:v][4:v][5:v]hstack=inputs=3[bottom];\
[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]" \
-map "[v]" \
finalOutput.mp4</code></pre>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475780643" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>That’s it folks. Now you know how to stack videos together horizontally, vertically, and in a grid. This is very useful in comparing videos and also creating fun effects along the way! </p>

<p>Modern marketing is all about data and however hard you might try, you can't spend any time around marketers online without <a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2013/11/prove-your-worth10-kpis-for-marketers.html">being</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/paid-owned-earned-content/242075/">subjected</a> <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/oracledatacloud/effectively-measuring-advertising-performance-your-guide-to-success">to</a> <a href="https://searchengineland.com/using-auction-insights-for-better-ppc-competitor-analysis-343264">endless</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/07/28/10-reasons-why-marketers-use-data-to-make-budgeting-decisions/">think</a> <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/spent-200000-facebook-ads-heres-learned">pieces</a>, how-to guides, ebooks or other dreck about how we need to track and measure and count every little thing.</p>
<p>We've got click rates, impressions, conversion rates, open rates, ROAS, pageviews, bounces rates, ROI, CPM, CPC, impression share, average position, sessions, channels, landing pages, KPI after never ending KPI.</p>
<p>That'd be fine if all this shit meant something and we knew how to interpret it. But <em>it doesn't</em> and <strong>we don't</strong>. </p>
<p>The reality is much simpler, and therefore much more complex.  Most of us don't understand how data is collected, how these mechanisms work and most importantly where and how they <em>don't</em> work.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/874736/ad-blocker-usage-in-united-kingdom/">36% percent of people in the UK</a> use an adblocker, which means your javascript based website tracking is meaningless</li>
<li>Email open rates <a href="https://developermedia.com/email-open-rates-misleading-metrics-best-practices-2/">don't <em>actually</em> indicate that an email was opened</a>, merely that a request was made to a server</li>
<li>The black boxes inside Facebook and other ad exchanges give you <a href="https://www.etcentric.org/facebook-agrees-to-40-million-fine-for-incorrect-ad-metrics/">flat out wrong</a> data about how your ads are performing</li>
<li>The audiences you're targeting on Google, Bing, etc <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/11/02/got-large-budgets-you-need-to-spend-fraudsters-will-help-you-spend-it/?sh=54b93f867a9f">are fraudulent</a> and don't even exist</li>
<li>The exchanges you're purchasing media space from are <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/is-ubers-new-ad-fraud-lawsuit-futile-or-game-changing/">cheating you</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And even if we know how the data is collected, what it means and what it's actually tracking, most of us don't have the technical chops to analyse the data we've collected<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I don't mean to rag on anyone by saying this, but we do need a reality check.</p>
<p>And look. I get it. Having tangible data allows us to demonstrate that we're doing our job and we're trying to measure and improve what we're doing. But as Bob Hoffman rightly points out - <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-mystery-of-modern-media.html">that's not how brands are built</a>. </p>
<p>The numbers are often all we have to prove our case, to get more budget and in extreme cases, to continue to stay employed. We'll remain in this mess until we can separate marketing from short sighted and poorly informed decision making. Until leaders can lead on the strength of their conviction and experience instead of second guessing themselves and their staff based on the inadequacy of data.</p>
<p>I don't know what the way out of this mess is, or what the path to success looks like. All I know is this.</p>
<p><em>We're addicted to bad data</em>.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <div>
      <article role="main">
        <p>This article is going to be an introduction to <strong>embedded Linux security</strong>.</p>
<p>Since this topic is quite extensive, I divided into two parts. In this first part, we will have a small introduction to security concepts and threat modeling and then focus on some mitigation techniques to improve the security of an embedded Linux device, including secure boot, code/data encryption and secure key storage.</p>
<p>If you prefer a one hour talk instead of reading this article, you can also watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUKAgVKSxQ">“Introduction to embedded Linux security”</a> I recorded for <a href="https://www.toradex.com/">Toradex</a>. I also gave the same talk at Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020, but as I write this article it was not yet published on YouTube.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with some concepts…</p>
<h2 id="security-concepts">Security concepts</h2>
<p>Security is all about risk mitigation.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have <strong>owners</strong>, those who benefit from a product or service (user, manufacturer, business owner, etc). And owners want to protect <strong>assets</strong>, anything that has some value in the product or service (data, code, reputation, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have <strong>threat actors</strong>, a person or thing (malicious hacker, government, etc) that can manifest a <strong>threat</strong>, anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.</p>
<p>To manifest a threat, the threat actor will explore <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> (weakness in the system) via an <strong>attack vector</strong>, a method or pathway used by the threat actor to access or penetrate the target system.</p>
<p>The diagram below express very well all those concepts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape/at_download/fullReport"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-security-concepts.png" alt="Security Concepts"></a></p>
<p>In the end, is a cat-and-mouse game between owners and threat actors. How far will the owner go to protect the assets? How far will the threat actor go to compromise the assets? It really depends on the value of the assets. Indeed, the perception of value may not be the same for owners and threat actors.</p>
<p>Identifying assets (and their value) to mitigate the risks of being compromised can be done in a process called <strong>threat modeling</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a process where potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. It is basically a risk assessment process where you evaluate the value of your assets and the cost to protect them. The result of a threat modeling is the <strong>threat model</strong> of your product.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling.png" alt="Threat modeling"></p>
<p>There are several techniques and methodologies that can help during threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, OCTAVE, and many others.</p>
<p>To have a very basic introduction to the topic, let’s talk about STRIDE and DREAD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">STRIDE model</a> is a very useful tool to help classify threats. It was developed by Microsoft and the name is an acronym for the six main types of threats: <strong>S</strong>poofing, <strong>T</strong>ampering, <strong>R</strong>epudiation, <strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure, <strong>D</strong>enial of service and <strong>E</strong>scalation of privileges. STRIDE can be used to identify all threats the assets of a system could be exposed to.</p>
<p><a href="https://allabouttesting.org/stride-acronym-of-threat-modeling-system/"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-stride.png" alt="STRIDE"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)">DREAD methodology</a> is a tool for risk-assessing computer security threats. The name is an acronym for five categories of security threats: <strong>D</strong>amage (how bad would an attack be), <strong>R</strong>eproducibility (how easy is it to reproduce the attack), <strong>E</strong>xploitability (how much work is it to launch the attack), <strong>A</strong>ffected users (how many people would be impacted) and <strong>D</strong>iscoverability (how easy is it to discover the threat).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SecurityInnovation/threat-modeling-to-reduce-software-security-risk"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-dread.png" alt="DREAD"></a></p>
<p>While the STRIDE model helps to identify the threats, the DREAD methodology helps to rank them. For each threat in the system, you would go over each threat category and classify it in low (1 point), medium (2 points), or high (3 points). In the end, you would have a ranked list of threats and mitigation strategies. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling-example.png" alt="Threat modeling example"></p>
<p>We can see that threat modeling will provide a very clear view of what we want to protect, how we plan to protect it, and associated costs. This is part of the <strong>threat model</strong> of the product, which needs to be re-evaluated for every development cycle. As a result, the threat model will provide a prioritized list of threats to work on, so we can focus on implementing the mitigations to improve the security of the product.</p>
<p>How to protect the integrity and authenticity of your code? How to ensure the privacy of the data? Where to store cryptographic keys? How to minimize the risks of an application to be exploited? Let’s try to answer all of those questions and many more, starting with secure boot!</p>
<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>
<p>How to make sure the code you are running was built by a trustworthy person or company? Implementing a <strong>secure boot</strong> process.</p>
<p>The objective of a secure boot process is to protect the integrity and authenticity of the code.</p>
<p>Secure boot is usually based on the verification of digital signatures. An embedded Linux system normally has three major components: bootloader, kernel and root filesystem (rootfs). All these components are signed and the signatures are checked during boot.</p>
<p>For example, some hardware mechanism can be used to check the signature of the bootloader, that will check the signature of the kernel, that will use a ramdisk image to check the signature of the root filesystem. Since we have one component checking the signature of the next one in the boot chain, this process is often called a <strong>chain-of-trust</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-1.png" alt="Secure boot"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real example on an <a href="https://www.nxp.com/imx6">NXP iMX6</a> device.</p>
<p>Everything starts in the ROM code inside the SoC. On NXP iMX6, there is a hardware component called High Assurance Boot (HAB) that it is able to validate the signature of the first stage bootloader, making it possible to implement a secure boot process. The High Assurance Boot inside iMX6 devices can also be called the <strong>Root of Trust</strong>, since if it is compromised, all the secure boot process is also compromised.</p>
<p>The ROM code inside the iMX6 SoC, using the HAB component, will check the signature of the bootloader. For that, it is necessary to generate a pair of keys (public and private), sign the bootloader with the private key and store the public key inside the SoC. On iMX6, OTP fuses are used to store the keys. Actually, to make it less expensive, only the hash of the public key is stored in the SoC.</p>
<p>When the bootloader boots (e.g. <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">U-Boot</a>), it will have to check the signature of the Linux kernel. For that, it is common to use an image format called <strong>FIT image</strong>. The FIT image is a container for multiple binaries with hashing and signature support, and usually contains the Linux kernel image, device tree files and an initial ramdisk. After generating a pair of keys, we need to sign the binaries inside the FIT image with the private key e configure U-Boot to use the public key to check the signature of the FIT image.</p>
<p>After the kernel boots, it will run the <em>init</em> program from the ramdisk image. The ramdisk will have the logic to verify the integrity of the final root filesystem before mounting it. There are some options to implement this. One common option is using the device-mapper verity (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">dm-verity</a>) kernel module. The <strong>dm-verity</strong> kernel module provides integrity checking of block devices and requires a read-only rootfs (squashfs can be a good solution). Other approaches would be <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Integrity_Measurement_Architecture">IMA</a> or <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html">dm-integrity</a> if you want a read-write root filesystem.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the complete secure boot process:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-2.png" alt="Secure boot on NXP iMX6"></p>
<p>This is only one example of a secure boot implementation, although it could be applied to a different set of boards and ARM SoCs.</p>
<p>Yet nothing is 100% secure!</p>
<p>Secure boot vulnerabilities in the ROM code of several NXP devices (i.MX6, i.MX50, i.MX53, i.MX7, i.MX28 and Vybrid families) were <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/vulnerabilities-in-high-assurance-boot-of-nxp-imx-microprocessors.html">publicly disclosed</a> on July 17th, 2017. And if your chain of trust is compromised, everything is compromised! So we need to be aware of these types of vulnerabilities (in this case, they were fixed with new silicon).</p>
<p>While secure boot ensures authenticity and integrity, it does not protect the device from being counterfeited or threat actors from extracting code/data from the device. So if you want to protect your intellectual property or ensure data confidentiality, you will need to use encryption.</p>
<h2 id="code-and-data-encryption">Code and data encryption</h2>
<p>You may want to encrypt data or code in an embedded Linux device.</p>
<p>Data encryption is a common approach when you need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the users. Data is any information generated during the executing of the device, including databases, configuration files, and so on.</p>
<p>Code encryption depends on the situation, and encrypting the full root filesystem is not that common. Usually, most of the components are free and open source software, so there is nothing to hide. There is also the issue of GPLv3 and Tivoization (using any GPLv3 software will force you to provide a mechanism for the user to update the software, and that would make it more difficult if you are encrypting it). A more common use case is to encrypt only the applications you developed for the device. It’s usually where your intellectual property is.</p>
<p>There are basically two main approaches to encryption in Linux: <strong>full disk encryption</strong> and <strong>file-based encryption</strong>.</p>
<p>Full disk encryption provides encryption at the block level and the whole disk or a disk partition is encrypted. For that, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>, the Linux kernel’s device mapper crypto target.</p>
<p>File-based encryption provides encryption at the file system level, where each directory may be separately and optionally encrypted with a different key. The two most common implementations of file-based encryption are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fscrypt">fscrypt</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs">eCryptFS</a>. fscrypt is an API available on some filesystems like EXT4, UBIFS and F2FS, and eCryptFS is a more generic solution implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem.</p>
<p>But what about the keys used for encryption?</p>
<h2 id="encryption-keys">Encryption keys</h2>
<p>Since an asymmetric key algorithm is too slow to be used in encryption, usually a symmetric-key algorithm is used in encryption. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and the key should be available somewhere in the filesystem so the encrypted code/data can be decrypted.</p>
<p>But we can’t just leave the key lying around in the filesystem, right?</p>
<p>There are several cases where companies …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to "Why use GraphQL" by Kyle Schrade (<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a>). It’s not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it’ll take some time, you’ll fully understand why I think Kyle’s article should be named “Why use Apollo”.</p><p>If you haven't read Kyles's article already, I think it makes most sense if you read it first: <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/</a></p><p>The author states that REST APIs come with a set of downsides and how GraphQL solves all of them:
Over-fetching
Multiple requests for multiple resources
Waterfall network requests on nested data
Each client need to know the location of each service</p><p>The first three issues could be solved by writing another REST API as a facade for a specific user interface. Take Next.JS as an example. Next lets you define APIs with a very lightweight syntax. Instead of making multiple requests from the client, you can wrap those calls into an API and make them server-side. Over and underfetching can be solved with this approach too, as you can manipulate the data before sending it back to the client. The pattern described is named "backend for frontend" (BFF). It's not limited to full stack frameworks like Next.JS. You can build a BFF for your mobile apps as well.</p><p>With the BFF pattern, the client itself doesn't have to know the location of each service. However, the developer who implements the BFF needs to understand the service landscape. Hopefully you have Open API Specifications for all your services, nicely presented in a developer portal. If that's the case, it should be easy to write a BFF.</p><p>With GraphQL, there still needs to be a developer who implements the resolvers. Implementing the resolvers is more or less the same task as building a BFF, the logic is very similar. So, what's the real difference?</p><p>The BFF is easier to implement as there's a lot more tooling available. E.g. if you use a framework like Next.JS in combination with swr hooks (stale while revalidate) you get automatic caching with Etags and cache invalidation out of the box. This reduces the amount of data sent between server and client. It's even less data than GraphQL, because you're not sending query payloads and the server responds with 304 (Not Modified) if the response is still valid. Additionally, you don't have to use a heavyweight client like Apollo. The library swr by Vercel is small and very easy to use. It comes with support for pagination, hooks, and helps to navigate back and forth very efficiently.</p><p>GraphQL has persisted queries but it comes with additional overhead to implement this. If you don't use a client like Relay, which persists Queries by default, you have to do it on your own or use some third party library to implement it. Compared to the BFF approach using e.g. Next.JS there's a lot more complexity involved in getting to the same results on the frontend. How would you implement Etags with GraphQL? How do you make your GraphQL server return 304 status codes if nothing changed? Don't you first have to turn all Queries into GET requests? If so, does your GraphQL client and server easily support this?</p><p>When it comes to user experience and ease of development, the BFF is the clear winner. Less data transfer between client and server. Easier to implement. Smaller client, less moving parts.</p><p>But there's a catch. You have to build a BFF for each individual frontend. If you have many of them this can be a lot of work. You have to maintain all the BFFs. You have to operate them. You have to secure them.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could have the benefits of both without making tradeoffs? This is exactly what WunderGraph is. A framework to build BFFs using GraphQL.</p><p>In the next paragraph, Kyle goes on with the problems involved with versioned APIs. He's absolutely right that having too many versions of an API makes it very hard to keep track of. He then concludes that in GraphQL, there's only one version of the graph and changes can be tracked in a schema registry, a paid feature of Apollo. For that reason you won’t have any problems with versioning, he says.</p><p>I have problems coming to the same conclusion. Just because GraphQL schemas don’t support versioning natively doesn’t mean the problem goes away. You get the same effect if you just don’t version your REST APIs. In fact, many experts say that you should always try to not introduce versions of an API if you don’t have to. That being said, what holds you off running two versions of your GraphQL schema? Not that I think this is a good idea but it's technically possible.</p><p>If having too many versions of your REST APIs is a problem in your organization, before throwing a new tool like GraphQL at the problem, maybe you should have a look at the organization first. What are the reasons for having so many versions? Maybe the change of a process or new team structures can help? GraphQL does absolutely nothing to solve your versioning problems. Instead I think it actually makes the situation worse.</p><p>Do you have to support mobile applications? You should be aware that shipping native apps takes time. You have to wait for app store approval and you can expect many of your users to never (or slowly) install the new version. What if you want to introduce a breaking change in this scenario without breaking a client? It's impossible. You have to introduce this change in a non-breaking way. It would be interesting to hear from Facebook how they avoided breaking clients.</p><p>Evolving your schema in the case of GraphQL would mean, you deprecate the old field and add a new one. New clients use the new field while you hope that the number of clients using the old field will get less and less. Hopefully, you have a system in place that forces your users to download a new version at some point in time. Otherwise, you might be forced to support the deprecated field indefinitely. If that's the case, the deprecation model of GraphQL doesn't help you at all.</p><p>With REST you could create a new endpoint or another version of an existing one. The problem is the same, the solution just looks a bit different.</p><p>To make it clear, if you cannot control your clients you really want some kind of versioning. If all you have is a single web application you won’t need this feature. But then again GraphQL might be overkill as well.</p><p>In this paragraph, the author states that RESTful APIs don't allow partial responses.</p><p>This is just wrong. Here's an example:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>GET /users?fields=results(gender,name)</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>What does the author actually mean? I'm pretty sure he's aware of partial responses. I guess what he's trying to say is that someone needs to implement partial responses. Actually, it looks very familiar to GraphQL as you're selecting subfields from a resource. With GraphQL we have this feature out of the box.</p><p>On the other hand, with the BFF approach, you don't need this. Just return exactly the data you need. Again, a full-stack framework like Next.JS makes it simpler to implement this, makes caching easier and gives you Etag based cache invalidation for free.</p><p>To sum this section up, GraphQL gives you exactly the data you need. Partial responses can achieve the same result. BFFs come with the additional cost of implementation and maintenance but have a better UX &amp; DX.</p><p>In this paragraph, Kyle addresses the issues of REST APIs not being strictly typed. He talks about the problems with APIs where it's not clear if you get an array of posts or something different and how query parameters complicate the situation. He also states that GraphQL, because of its strict type system, doesn't have this problem.</p><p>I think what Kyle is talking about is an organizational problem for which you need an organizational solution.</p><p>You have the kind of problems he describes, when you allow developers to deploy REST APIs without publishing Open API Specifications (OAS) or similar. With OAS all resources can be described very easily. OAS also allows you to describe OAuth2 flows and required scopes per endpoint. Additionally, you can describe the exact types and validation rules for query parameters, a feature that GraphQL is lacking.</p><p>Looking at GraphQL, there's no way to describe Authentication, Authorization and input validation. GraphQL is lacking these features because the inventors at Facebook solved this problem at a different layer. There was no need for them to add these features to GraphQL. You can add custom directives to your schema to achieve similar results like OAS but this would be a custom implementation which you have to maintain yourself.</p><p>You might be thinking that OAS doesn't guarantee the response of an API to be compliant with the specification. You would be right. But how does a GraphQL schema guarantee anything?</p><p>GraphQL introspection is the act of sending a specific GraphQL query to the server to get information about the GraphQL schema. The GraphQL server is free to answer with whatever types it wants to. If you send a Query, the server can answer with a response that doesn't adhere to the GraphQL schema from the introspection response. Take Apollo Federation as an example. You upload your schema into a schema registry and then, by error, deploy the wrong version of your GraphQL server. If you change the type of a field, the client might be confused.</p><p>When we talk about type safety in GraphQL, what we actually mean is that we trust in a GraphQL server to behave exactly as advertised by the introspection Query …</p></section></div>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor model’s isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.</p>

<p>Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.</p>

<p>Approach:  We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor languages for five radically different types of message synchronization patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages. Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based programming language.</p>

<p>Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can respond.</p>

<p>Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we implemented a DSL —— called Sparrow —— that supports said operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL outperforms existing approaches.</p>

<p>Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the —— relatively simplistic single-message based matching —— mechanisms of most actor-based languages.</p>

<p>It was <em>very</em> easy to plug the 400 in and get it up and running. It’s a neat device, with a good collection of ports and connectors at the back. The keyboard is…ok. The device is £67 in the UK. I bought the kit (which includes a mouse, power supply, HDMI cable, and official guide) for £94. Given the price point the keyboard is absolutely fine, but it does feel a tiny bit “plasticy”.</p>

<p>The 400 doesn’t have an audio-out. Audio is delivered via the HDMI output. For me, that’s a problem because my monitor doesn’t have speakers. It’s not a BIG problem, but it’s something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>The other thing the 400 doesn’t have is the connector for the Raspberry Pi camera module. Again, this isn’t a big deal for me but if you were expecting to build any camera projects then the 400 isn’t the right choice.</p>

<p>The 400has the GPIO header at the back, so with a ribbon cable you can build electronics projects very easily. I have an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2028">Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus</a> which makes it very easy to connect the 400 to a breadboard and build…stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/gpio.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>The 400 starts up quickly, and is very capable as a general purpose desktop device. I’ve spent most of today browsing the web on it, while also installing apps, running docker containers, and building code, and it’s felt fast/snappy pretty much most of the time.</p>

<p>Overall, the hardware is pretty good and I love the form factor. I can see schools/code clubs purchasing these devices and using the in their computing labs.</p>

<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent the day setting my Raspberry Pi 400 up, and I’m pretty impressed. My setup has included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up Chromium, and installed the <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password extension</a></li>
  <li>Installed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> using <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-visual-studio-code/">these instructions</a></li>
  <li>Installed the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">VS Code Remote Containers extension</a> so that I can use Docker dev containers to develop code within</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, this setup was easy. So easy it was almost boring! I had a couple of issues, but on the whole it was very easy to set my Raspberry Pi 400 up so that I can write code, use Docker, and push changes to GitHub. For example, I’m currently writing this blog post within VS Code, building it using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> within a Docker container.</p>

<p>The only issue that I hit is the ARM support for various Docker images. The default Ruby dev container image wouldn’t build because it had some dependencies that didn’t have ARM variants. In the end I took the Ruby 2.7 docker image as a base, and copy/pasted into my own <code>Dockerfile</code> the parts of the defintion I needed (removing Node, Zsh, Oh my Zsh and a few other things). I’m not sure exactly what it was that was failng to build, so I need to go back and work it out, but it’s worth remembering that if the Rasberry Pi is ARM based, and not all development tools have ARM builds.</p>

<p>Having installed tools, and played around, I’ve built some very basic Rust code (with build times comparible to my MacBook!), I’ve written some <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GPIOZero</a> based Python 3 code (controlling butons and LEDs), and I’ve set up a Jekyll/Ruby dev container and built/updated my blog.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3). Most of them are the Model B format, but I have couple of Zeros too. All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.</p>

<p>On top of that…it gives me a massive nostalgia rush using it!</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/desktop.jpg" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>In the picture below I have two instances of VS Code (both running dev containers), plus I’m browsing. It takes it all in its stride.</p>

<p><img src="https://martinpeck.com/images/rpi400/pi-400-desktop.png" alt="GPIO"></p>

<p>I’ve not tried building anything huge…but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for having fun…</p>

<p>…and I’m <strong>absolutely having fun</strong>!</p>

                    <p>Wars can be fought in the real world but there is also a virtual battlefield - and it is just as harmful. The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</a> is the latest attempt to access people's encrypted data and it serves as another reinforcement.</p><blockquote>This type of “warrant-proof” encryption adds little to the security of the communications of the ordinary user, but it is a serious benefit for those who use the internet for illicit purposes.</blockquote><p>This statement is plainly false. Encryption has as much benefit, if not more, for ordinary users. Encryption is used in every website that has the padlock sign (HTTP<strong>S</strong>), in every iPhone app since 2016, in every Android app since 2018 and in almost every modern application - and for good reason. Encryption helps protect sensitive information (such as that shared with your bank, or any time you use a password on a website). It may also help protect files which are not in use (at rest), or in the event the server is accessed by an unauthorised person (such as a criminal attempting to siphon off important data).</p><p>In 2016, Bruce Schneier wrote an article on <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/04/the_value_of_encrypt.html">the value of encryption</a> clearly outlining why encryption is needed. Schneier went on to say that when the US Government was <a href="https://blog.privacytools.io/us-government-wages-war-on-encryption/">previously</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">fighting cryptography</a>, he wondered if they were aware how much they relied on it themselves. No-one is above the law, so if you ban strong encryption, the FBI should not use it either. Attorney General Barr, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/23/us_encryption_backdoor/">gives the impression</a> that the government, along with certain large companies, should have an exception to the law. Barr recognises that there are some things that are secret, but he doesn't recognise that regular citizens might also want to enjoy privacy as well.</p><blockquote>“We are not talking about protecting the nation’s nuclear launch codes,” Barr told the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University.</blockquote><blockquote>“Nor are we necessarily talking about the customized encryption used by large business enterprises to protect their operations. We are talking about consumer products and services such as messaging, smart phones, email, and voice and data applications."</blockquote><p>Somehow, because your average Joe does not have government level secrets, he is no longer entitled to encryption. We are all humans, and we all need privacy. By taking away encryption, you are taking away privacy online.</p><p>This act is aimed at Section 230, which ensures that no interactive computer service provider shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of content published by their users - an essential part of the survival of all search engines, social media platforms and video sharing sites. Without it, the internet would become a self-censored platform – one that is more concerned with fending off lawsuits than providing a medium for ideas and innovation as it originally was.</p><p>It is easy to sympathise with an act that is being pushed through on the grounds that terrorists, paedophiles and drug-dealers all use encryption. Reading the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html">New York Times</a>' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/podcasts/the-daily/child-sex-abuse.html">reporting</a> on online images of &nbsp;sexual abuse would leave some wondering why this sort of Act has not been passed already. Equally, if no-one had encryption then it would certainly be easier to catch above mentioned crooks and fellons.</p><p>Encryption, however, did not create these problems; these crimes were around long before it came into existence. In addition, those who partake in illicit activity will always find loopholes and ways to do so, such as using products or encryption tools that don't have backdoors. Criminals do not obey laws by definition. Furthermore, many innocent people use similar encryption to these criminals, but only to protect privacy, not hide any illegalities and yet they could still be subject to some kind of prosecution. It is assumed the use or possession of non-backdoored software would also become an offence if too many people used that instead. Statistically, it's agreed there are many more innocent people in society than criminals; those innocent people would be punished as a result of the bad actions of a few.</p><p>It is not feasible for a government to make a law of this sort that can apply outside of it's own country. Governments around the world would almost certainly disagree on which countries should be allowed access to the backdoor. As a result, this backdoor would most certainly lead to every unauthorised party having access, as the key to decrypt the data would be discovered by third parties, this would result in completely broken encryption for all. In federated networks, such as Matrix, it's not even possible to add a backdoor to every homeserver. Federation decentralises trust, which means that the person deploying the server isn't necessarily the same entity who makes the client software or server software. Matrix has even written a <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors">thorough article</a> on how to combat this sort of abuse without backdoors. </p><p>Weakening encryption will only result in criminals using strong encryption anyway, without fighting any of the problems that the the law claims to solve. There is no easy solution, and it is down to politicians to provide one. Yes, encryption can be used by people with bad intentions, but it is also used by so many ordinary people who would never think to use it in a malicious way. Nearly every tool in life can be used for nefarious purposes, but does not mean it should be unavailable for legitimate non-criminal uses. You could hit someone with a hammer, but it doesn't mean hammers should be made out of foam, because if they were, people would just use knives instead. Weakening encryption will not solve these issues, and that's probably because they were not the the focus of the Act. Instead, it seems that this law seeks to criminalises strong encryption that does not have backdoors, even though the government knows full well that this will not stop criminals. The US Government should stop devising new ways to breach its citizens privacy, and focus on combating the issues that this Act fails to.</p><p>In 1988, Timothy May <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html">predicted</a> that “the State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of [encryption], citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration”. He was spot on.</p><p><em>Cover artwork by <a href="https://setofprinciples.com/">Zan</a></em></p>

One of the most delightful parts of being a software engineer and hardware
tinkerer is having the ability to solve my own specific (and often niche)
problems. In this post, the particular problem I’ll be solving is the burning
need to know what is currently playing on <a href="https://www.wqxr.org/">WQXR</a>, NYC’s classical radio station.</p>

<p>A typical Saturday for me looks like this: I wake up and make a coffee, bring
it to the couch in the living room, pick up my knitting, and turn on the radio. Maybe midway through the morning
a halfway-familiar piece comes on, but I’ve left my phone in the other room and won’t be
able to go check the WQXR website without disentangling myself from my
knitting and missing a bit of the piece that has captured my attention.</p>

<p>Or how about a weekday: I’m working on a project, elbows deep in the code, with the WQXR livestream open in one of my million
browser tabs. I feel a glimmer of recognition, but I’m fully focused on my
work and don’t want to break my concentration to go hunt down the livestream
player and find out what it is.</p>

<p>To solve this particular problem, I needed two things: a way to find out what
was on the radio, and a place to display it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of different ways you could find out what’s playing,
including music identification services like Shazam. But those rely on already
having a recording in their database to match against, and I’m listening to
classical music where I could be hearing any one of dozens of different
recordings (and even live performances) for any given piece, making it
unlikely that such a service would be able to find a match. So I started with
the source I was already using to get this information: the WQXR website.</p>

<p>If you leave the website open long enough, you’ll notice that it automatically
updates to reflect what’s currently playing. This was great news for me,
because it meant that somewhere in the page a script is periodically making
ajax requests to get that information, requests that I could also make myself.
To find out what these requests were, I eavesdropped on my browser’s network
calls using the developer console.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-network.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>There are two calls being made here, one to an endpoint called streams,
and one to something very promisingly named <code>whats_on</code>. Making a request to
that second endpoint, we get a beautiful json response containing information
about what’s playing on New York Public Radio’s various livestreams. Great!
This is exactly what I need to satisfy the first piece of this project.</p>

<p>(I honestly can’t remember how I figured this out, but you can append the call
letters for the particular station you’re interested in to the URI to just get
information for that stream, but the full response would also have worked just
fine.)</p>

<p>Okay, cool, so I have the data. How do I get this information in front of my
eyeballs when I’m listening to the radio?</p>

<p>You already know from the teaser photo at the top of the post that
I ultimately put it on my mantel, but I took an iterative approach to getting
there.</p>

<p>I use tmux to manage my terminal sessions, and it occurred to me that the
status bar, always there along the bottom of my terminal, might be a nice
place to have information about what’s currently playing. I wrote some
lightweight python classes for fetching and parsing the radio’s API response,
and a tiny script, <code>tmux.py</code> that outputs the information in the format I want for this
purpose.</p>

<p>Adding something to the tmux status bar is just a matter of adding a couple of
lines to <code>.tmux.conf</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right-length 200
<span>set</span> <span>-g</span> status-right <span>'#[bg=#d7ff5f] #(python3
/home/sarabee/development/nowplaying/tmux.py)  |  [%H:%M] '</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This overwrote the clock that was there by default, so I added one back in. By
default, scripts run in <code>.tmux.com</code> are executed once every 15 seconds, which
was more than fast enough for my purpose. My status bar then looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/now-playing.jpg"></p>

<p>This fixed the problem of not wanting to leave my terminal to find out what
I’m listening to, but what about when I’m in the living room? I knew I wanted
a display, that I wanted it to update automatically, like the tmux status bar,
that I wanted it to be constantly running, like an indoor thermometer readout,
and that I wanted it to be readable from any position in the room, with good
view angles and readability under a variety of lighting conditions.  This all
sounded to me like the <em>perfect</em> excuse to work with e-paper.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.pimoroni.com/">Pimoroni</a> was having a sale, so I picked up two e-ink displays: the smaller inkypHAT, and the
larger inkywHAT. I also got a couple of Raspberry Pi Zero Ws to pop them on
top of (quick aside: these things cost $10 and have wifi and bluetooth, wowww).</p>

<p>Starting with the inkypHAT and the code I’d already written for handling radio
data, I prototyped my idea, creating a tiny display that sits on top of my
monitor. I set the Pi Zeroes up the way I set up my larger Raspberry Pi 3,
with Raspbian Lite. Without worrying too much about styling the display
aesthetically, I learned how to work with the
<a href="https://github.com/pimoroni/inky">Inky</a> and
<a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> libraries and
wrote a script to get the composer and title chopped up to fit across multiple
lines on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/wqxr-phat.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I have it running once a minute on a cron, and to avoid refreshing the e-ink
display unnecessarily, I keep the last piece written to the display in memory and
update only if I’ve gotten something new back from WQXR.</p>

<p>Reworking this script for the larger inkywHAT display wasn’t difficult; it
mostly involved tweaking font size to take advantage of the larger screen. But
since this is meant to live on my mantel and be highly visible in my living
room, I wanted to make it look a bit nicer than just throwing the text on
there. I found a clip-art scrollwork frame, and using only the MacOS Preview
app and ImageMagick, got it into the right size and format
for the e-ink display.</p>

<p>In Preview, I grabbed a corner of the frame and pasted it in again three more
times, rotated 90 degrees each time, and carefully bumped each corner around
until they were lined up and could be scaled down reasonably to the right
dimensions (400x300px). Even though the image appeared to be entirely black
and white, a closer look shows this wasn’t true at all! It’s actually full of
many different shades of gray:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-corner.png" width="300"></p>

<p>To get the image into the right format and flatten it down to just two colors,
I used the <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php">ImageMagick command-line
tools</a>. While <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/quantize/#two_color">this
extremely thorough page</a> in the IM docs goes pretty far in-depth with the
various ways you can convert an image to black and white, I ultimately ended
up going with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">magick input.png <span>-colorspace</span> gray <span>-colors</span> 2 <span>-normalize</span> PNG8:output.png</code></pre></figure>

<p>Which produces a frame that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-frame.png"></p>

<p>It’s a little rough when you see it on a relatively high resolution monitor, but looks great on the 400x300 e-ink
display! After that, adding the text was pretty straightforward;
earlier when only displaying text, I was still actually using Pillow to create an empty
image in the correct dimensions that I drew the text onto:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"P"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>WIDTH</span><span>,</span> <span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>HEIGHT</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To use the frame, I simply started with the frame image instead:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>img</span> <span>=</span> <span>Image</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>current_dir</span><span>,</span>
<span>"whatnow.png"</span><span>)).</span><span>resize</span><span>(</span><span>inky_display</span><span>.</span><span>resolution</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The last little bit of clean-up work involved getting the text centered in the
frame, and setting the margins in my script so that the line breaks were
a comfortable distance from its edges.</p>

<p><img src="http://sarabee.github.io/images/whatnow-closeup.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>I’m happy with where this project is at; the text is clear and legible from
anywhere in my living room, and my Saturday morning listening experience has
been greatly improved. Eventually, it’ll get custom wooden housing, which will
be its own post, I’m sure! Feel free to dig around in <a href="https://github.com/SaraBee/nowplaying">the project’s repo on
GitHub</a> to get an even better idea of how this all works.</p>

<![CDATA[Go in Production – Lessons Learned]]>

November 6, 2020 | https://tdom.dev/go-in-production | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tdom.dev/go-in-production">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got a DevOps job that mostly involves writing a new backend system in Go completely from scratch. Here's what I learned having never actually used it in production, knowing it mostly just from personal projects.</p>

<p>At the start, we decided to try simply sticking with Go's http library and a simple routing library - <code> mux</code>.</p>
<p>However, I quickly ran into real-life, production problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recovery middleware </strong> -  for logging &amp; silently handling panics in handler's code.</li>
<li><strong>Logging </strong> -  I wanted some solution that would print information about each request, including body params, auth tokens, etc. (for debugging purposes).</li>
<li><strong>Better error handling </strong> -  I wanted the errors to still be JSON responses with an error message and code.</li>
<li><strong>Other commonly-used middleware </strong> -  including JWT auth and CORS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had two options; implement solutions to the above problems myself, use different 3rd party libraries for each problem, or pick a web framework that already does most (if not all) of these things.</p>
<p>I eventually decided to use the Echo web framework. With almost 20k GitHub stars, a pretty active community, and great documentation I thought it was a great tool for the job.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-site.png" alt="echo site"></p>
<p>I also found there to be a little less boilerplate when it comes to writing the apps in <code>echo</code> (mainly when parsing a json body, writing errors, and manually setting headers), leading to improved code readability.</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-simple.png" alt="comparison"></p>
<p>However the real difference in productivity will be noticed when you have slightly more complex endpoints. You'll often run into cases where you need to validate certain JSON fields, and you'll want meaningful error messages describing what's wrong. If you want to do that without any library, your code will quickly become much harder to read:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/echo-cmp-large.png" alt="comparison"></p>

<p>Go web frameworks (or go in general) don't enforce any particular file structure. If you ever used something like ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say that some frameworks are tightly structured and many things are done implicitly by convention rather than explicitly specified.</p>
<p>The thing about Go is that it's really easy to skip learning about structuring your code and make it a hard to read+maintain mess. If you still don't know what I'm talking about, here's an example of a (<strong>bad</strong>) Go endpoint I wrote a while back:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/bad-good-structure.png" alt="bad code"></p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? It's quite likely that the in total the "better" way will contain more lines in total after adding all the <code>CreateUser</code> and <code>CreateAgency</code> methods, but… It will be much easier to understand, reuse, debug, and modify later on as each method will have a single purpose.
If you haven't already, I highly recommend you have a look at the following resources for a good code structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ribice/gorsk">https://github.com/ribice/gorsk</a> - nice example of a basic REST API</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch">https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch</a> - also a REST API example, but more strictly following the "Clean Architecture" concepts</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the concept is simple. You should separate the code that communicates with the database from the actual application logic itself, which should also stay separate from the transport/endpoint logic (in this example the HTTP endpoints).</p>

<p>When I first started programming in Go, I wanted to use the least libraries possible, so of course I opted in for using the <code>database/sql</code> package (with Postgres). Although the experience was OK, I came across quite a lot of boilerplate when querying data, especially having to use the Scan syntax.
This lead me to the following 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sqlx </code> -  a lightweight wrapper on top of <code>database/sql</code> with some extensions that will make querying much easier.</li>
<li><code>gorm </code> -  an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)  library for Go, which generates SQL models and queries based on your Go models.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think there's a clear "better" library, in the end it comes down to the use case and preference.</p>
<p><code>gorm</code> will probably make your life easier, especially if you often forget to add fields to queries after altering the database (because in gorm you won't have to do that at all).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>sqlx</code> on the other hand is much more SQL centric, it's more like writing Go code to interface with SQL rather than gorm 's approach of generating SQL from Go code. It's nice if you prefer to have total control over your SQL and not having to learn new syntax of GORM.</p>

<p>One of the challenges I came across was configuring the project for production. There are always some differences between the dev and prod environments, such as what port the app should run on, the host and credentials for the database, and etc.</p>
<p>I've seen people configure their app variables via JSON, YAML, or even gitignored&nbsp;.go files. I personally found env files to work the best, especially with docker-compose:</p>
<p><img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-env.png" alt=".env">
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/docker-compose.png" alt="docker-compose">
I usually combine these with the following utility functions:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/env-util.png" alt="Dockerfile">
Building the Docker image is also extremely easy in Go.:
<img src="https://tdom.dev/images/go-in-production/dockerfile.png" alt="Dockerfile"></p>

<p>There are also a few other things that came to my mind that I didn't consider worth their own sections:</p>

<p>There once was a society in which horizontal totalitarianism was so successful that, without any need for a State or institutions, simple social pressure from friends and neighbours was sufficient to conserve a culture and its customs, perhaps for over forty thousand years. One could even speculate that if Captain James Cook had not disembarked in Australia it may have lasted even longer. The indigenous people of this island-continent are suggestive of the power of horizontal totalitarianism as a form of organisation capable of formatting people so that practically any individual initiative that may alter traditional world-views and customs virtually disappears. Aboriginal Australians did not need to burn at the stake those who broke taboos or refused to respect and follow traditional rites. It was enough that their peers would exclude them from the community, and that they would then perish in the desert (see, for instance, Philip Clarke’s comprehensive anthropological history <em>Where the Ancestors Walked</em>, 2003).</p>



<p>In other societies, more technologically advanced and on the whole ideologically less monolithic, institutional repression has been necessary to eliminate ideologies and behaviours that diverge from horizontal totalitarian norms. In many places, professionalised clergy quickly assumed responsibility for fixing community laws and seeing that they were obeyed, using prosecution analogous to criminal trials against what was considered sinful conduct. These sins were widely understood as crimes against society, or rather, against the maintenance of totalitarian control over individual minds. This is the case, for example, of the ancient Hebrew priesthood, whose sentences were carried out collectively by the people through stoning, a fact that indicated that the punishment was not purely the responsibility of an authority that enforced its will from top to bottom, but also that of the neighbours and acquaintances of the sinner/offender. It was the community that took on and carried out the right to punish. Over time, the State increasingly assumed this power for itself, substituting a vertical order for the earlier horizontal one, which ultimately culminated in modern forms such as fascism and communism. Nowadays, aside from its use by the Cuban dictatorship for its own interests, as well as those who aspire to imitate it in other parts of Spanish-speaking Latin America, horizontal totalitarianism has lost its institutional power in almost all geographical locations and civilizations. This includes Australia, where the aboriginal people, like those of New Guinea, have had to accept modern respect for the individual and the separation, at least in theory, of church, State and ethnicity. However, this does not mean that horizontal totalitarianism is a thing of the ancient past. Even without an established institutional power, its social manifestations continue to oppress people in all too many places, and the modern Western world is no exception. In contrast to the vertical kind, horizontal totalitarianism does not by any means need to dominate public institutions in order to come into being, or to crush the individual, because it pre-dates and exists independently from these institutions.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In fact, horizontal totalitarianism may also arise without availing itself of institutional agency, since it does not require any institutions in order to repress or eliminate dissidents. It is difficult to fight against this type of totalitarianism because anyone could be one of its agents and its workings can remain opaque even to those who enthusiastically practice it in their daily lives. Horizontal totalitarianism represents a totalitarianism exercised by the majority (or a dominant minority able to sway and manipulate a majority) of a given community by oppressing other members of that community who do not adhere to its unwritten rules. It oppresses minorities as well as those who are seen as disturbing or threatening the homogeneity of the community as a unique and complete entity. In horizontal totalitarianism, there is no need for external authorities to impose their will, against whom the community of the oppressed can, in turn, rebel. Since the majority, made up of oppressors and their conformist followers, and the minority of oppressed people live on the same social plane, the persecuted can hardly rely on the solidarity of their fellow dissidents because they find themselves isolated and disempowered among the mass of individuals who apply the unwritten laws of uniformity, and of the totalitarian unity of the community.</p>



<p>It may seem excessive to some to term this horizontal oppression ‘totalitarian’. However, its consequences for people and societies are even more serious than those of vertical totalitarianism. An incalculable number of people have died at the hands of their neighbours and countrymen since the beginning of time. How many Muslim women have been stoned to death by their neighbours for not adhering to their society’s sexual mores? How many Hindu men and women have been murdered by their relatives for daring to marry outside their caste? How many individuals have died for not believing in their tribe’s chosen god? How many have died for daring to question the beliefs and prejudices held by the majority of people in their community? And we are not talking about primitive societies here, nor solely those of the past. Today, homosexual people still commit suicide in communities where widespread homophobia turns their existence into a living hell. We still see people exiled or forced to seek asylum because they refused to partake in the religious or political ideas of their people, or because they do not belong to the predominant ethnicity or ideological affiliation of their region. Criticism, whether more or less open; social vacuums; and the impossibility of leading a life of one’s own, continue to hound all those who, for whatever reason, are seen as being <em>abnormal</em>.</p>



<p>Even our private lives are threatened, and not only by corrupt and opportunistic politicians who take advantage of people’s prejudices to limit minority rights and secure their own power. This power, built on populism, is but the political face of horizontal totalitarianism. Thanks to the development of the surveillance methods and mutual control structures offered by information technologies, before long we might begin to receive scores (c.f. China’s social credit system) and, consequently, punishments and rewards, based on our neighbours’ or communities’ opinions of us. No longer will anyone wish to be original, extravagant or creative, nor outspokenly contrarian, because this may cause that group of people who judge us with each passing moment to turn against us. This phenomenon can be observed in the actions of existing successful public silencing initiatives, which confront questions and divergent opinions with insults, as seen in the unfortunate social media lynchings perpetrated in recent years by fanaticised supporters of MeToo or Black Lives Matter, or by similar movements with equally extreme ideologies. While it is true that these phenomena are not new, in the past they were only dangerous once they crossed into the physical realm, when people became a policing mass, as explained by Gustave Le Bon in <em>The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind </em>(<em>Psychologie des foules </em>1895). Thanks to current technologies and the eternal social instincts of the human being, the ‘mechanical solidarity’ of closed, traditional communities, as described by Émile Durkheim in <em>The Division of Labour in Society </em>(<em>De la division du travail social </em>1893), may even accumulate more repressive force today than it has already enjoyed for millennia.</p>



<p>The Internet has been and continues to be a powerful tool for unleashing self-expression and individual creativity. In theory, anyone can propose anything online, and by the same token, can oppose anything. Then again, it is important to ask oneself how many people might maintain their silence, or hide their convictions for fear of the aforementioned media lynchings. We are also aware of numerous children and adolescents who have committed suicide to escape cyberbullying perpetrated by their neighbours and classmates, for their apparent lack of conformity to some ideal or principle of normalcy prevalent at the time. For horizontal totalitarianism, social harassment is a powerful weapon that the Internet has not deactivated; one could even argue that its power has intensified, since the Internet makes it easy for the number of bullies to increase exponentially.</p>



<p>The danger appears even greater when taking into account that neither writers nor intellectuals wish to denounce it. On the contrary, the modern and postmodern idealisation of all manner of closed societies, from primitive tribes to rural villages, has inspired numerous texts precisely condemning that one place where the individual may, to an extent, escape horizontal totalitarianism. That is, the great modern city in which economic and political freedom prevail, as well as freedom to practice traditional customs. In the city, it is not possible for everyone to know and control you. Unlike the village or tribe, in which everyone knows everyone else, no one has any reason to know anything about you and thus you can carry on your life without fear of criticism or attacks from other members of the community. No one will disapprove of you because you do not attend mass or believe in the God or gods that the village or tribe dictates you should, make love in a way that is condemned by the ruling community’s morality, or fail to profess belief in your nationality being superior to that of foreigners. Aside from mandatory compliance with laws and the reciprocal respect essential to a peaceful coexistence, the individual is sovereign and is no longer a mere component of a mechanical social …</p></div></div>

<p>This week, as an addendum to our four(and a half)-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/02/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-hammer-time/">III</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/">IVa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">IVb</a>) look at pre-modern iron and steel production, we’re going to look at two alternative regional processes, where they fit into the entire iron production process that we detailed already, how they worked and what kind of product they produced.  In particular, we are going to look at the early production of cast iron in China, and the production of a form of crucible steel, called <em>wootz</em>, in India (and South Asia more broadly).</p>



<p>First, some necessary caveats.  Neither of these methods of iron production were practiced in my core area of research (the greater Mediterranean world during the Hellenistic and Roman periods), although <em>wootz</em> steel was imported in small quantities during that time and a handful of cast iron goods produced in China also made it to the broader Roman or Hellenistic world (though very, <em>very</em> few).  Consequently my knowledge here is much thinner and I am much more reliant on reporting the work of other scholars.  Moreover, some of the scholarship on these topics is in languages I do not read, so I am also reliant on other scholars for that.  As such, this is going to be a much more general discussion of these processes and I am going to be a bit more cautious about what I say about them.  At the same time, I simply don’t have the information to talk much about the details of the lives of the iron-workers here themselves, like I could in the previous posts, so this will mostly focus on process and product, rather than people.</p>



<p>That said, I thought this was still worth doing because it seems like there is quite a bit of unhelpful ‘mystique’ surrounding both.  On the one hand, a lot of the discussion of the production of cast iron in China fails to really put the innovation both in the correct spot in the iron production process but also in the correct context in terms of the development of iron-working technology.  On the other hand, much of the popular discussion about <em>wootz</em> steel in India treats it as this quasi-legendary ‘lost’ and mysterious production process when it is, in fact, a fairly well understood method of producing high-quality steel.</p>



<p>And of course, as always, if you want to support my essay production process, you can do so via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a> and by sharing to my work to a wider audience (but please do not copy-and-repost these essays; link to them instead).  And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings (and I promise fewer political musings now that the electoral<em> <em>götterdämmerung</em></em> has come and – heavens I hope by the time this post goes live – gone).</p>






<p>(Subsequent edit: Due to some election-related trolling coming from off-site, I had to prune back the comments to the original topic.  Apologies for those whose comments were pruned (except the troll) but I wanted to keep us on topic and away from the abyss of endless political carping.)</p>



<h2>Cast Iron in China</h2>



<p>Now I’ve stated several times during this series that generally speaking the bloomeries used to smelt iron in the pre-modern period were not capable of reaching the high temperatures (1538 °C) required to actually melt iron and instead produced pure metallic iron through solid state reduction (that is, the bloomery process) along with, essentially, melting everything that <em>wasn’t</em> iron out of the bloom.  And for most of the world in most of the pre-modern period, this is true.</p>



<p><strong>China appears to be the odd exception</strong>.  I should note that this is an area of scholarship that is still quite active – dates are still in flux (shifting back as new discoveries push back the earliest dates) and the exact nature of the transitions from bronze-working to iron-working in China and the degree to which the bloomery processes we’ve discussed served as an intermediate stage is still debated, as far as I know.  A fair bit of the discussion of the question is, unsurprisingly, in Chinese, which I cannot read.  So I am doing my best to provide a summary of what I know.</p>

<p>Cast iron in China seems to become widespread during the Warring States period (453-221), though the technology itself probably had its genesis in the earlier Spring and Autumn period (770-454) and it becomes truly ubiquitous during the early Qin-Han Period (221 BC – 220 AD).  The general working hypothesis based on the evidence is that the cast iron product emerged not out of bloomery iron production (which seems to have been used in China side-by-side with cast iron production for the first couple of centuries) but instead out of the furnace techniques already in use for casting objects in copper-alloy (read: bronze), until the cast iron process became able to produce a high enough quality iron product that it supplanted bloomery production, probably in the last century BC. Again, those dates are very approximate and seem to me to still be significantly unsettled, going by the range I’ve seen in scholarship (the most recent I could find on this was “Everything Old is new Again?  Rethinking the Transition to Cast Iron production in the Central Plains of China” in <em>Journal of Anthropological Research</em> (2014), so those are the dates I have gone with; Craddock and Tylecote both have somewhat later dates).</p>



<p>The basic interaction of producing cast iron centers around one oddity in carbon-iron alloys: <strong>as you add more carbon to iron, the melting point of the resulting mixture drops</strong>.  At 4.3% carbon content, the melting point of iron drops to just 1150 °C, which <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/">as you will recall</a>, is very much within reach for pre-modern furnaces worked by bellows (and China seems to have generally had better, hotter furnaces than contemporary pre-modern Europe to boot).  Adding small amounts of either sulfur (typically from coal being used to supply the carbon) or phosphorous can lower the melting point further, although these can also make the metal brittle.  At that point, large, bellows-fed furnaces can heat the iron-carbon mixture up to the point where it melts and becomes sufficiently fluid to cast (slag and other impurities, being lighter, can be drawn out with a flux and tapped off).  <strong>The result is cast iron</strong> (also called ‘pig iron’).</p>



<p>The <em>problem</em>, as we’ve discussed earlier, <strong>is that cast iron</strong> (which, to be clear, iron produced this way is still cast iron, even if you aren’t pouring it into a model; it is a type of iron as will become plain) <strong>comes out of the process with unfavorable characteristics</strong>, particularly in strength, brittleness and malleability – <strong>in short, it is too hard, too weak, and too prone to break and crack rather than bend</strong>.  The carbon content of cast iron is, of course, very high: above 4%, the carbon makes the iron much too hard and inflexible, causing it to become extremely brittle.  In particular, if the silicon content (which is likely to come from bits of slag melting and dissolving into the iron at the high temperatures) is low and the iron is cooled fairly quickly, it forms into cementite, which is hard and brittle.  Cementite isn’t bad in and of itself – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/16/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ivb-work-hardening-or-hardly-working/">we saw this with heat-treated steel</a>, where just a bit of cementite among the ferrite offered improved strength and hardness.  But this is not just a little cementite, it is <em>lots of cementite</em>.  In excess of 60% cementite, what is sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#White_cast_iron">‘white’ cast iron</a>.  <strong>At these levels, the amount of cementite leaves the cast iron very hard and very brittle, likely to break</strong> <strong>and actually difficult to cast effectively</strong> (because it is likely to crack from thermal stresses as it cools).</p>

Using mechanical assistance like this would have made the furnace operation significantly more labor efficient.</figcaption></figure>



<p>More slowly cooled cast iron with high silicon content, can come as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_iron#Grey_cast_iron">‘grey’ cast iron</a>, which has less cementite, but has instead pockets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite"><em>graphite</em> </a>– little pockets of cure crystalline carbon which couldn’t be absorbed into the iron – which have very little strength and essentially functions as cracks within the iron, reducing the overall toughness considerably.  Craddock notes that early Chinese cast iron tends to be grey cast iron, but – curiously – with somewhat lower silicon contents than we’d expect for grey cast iron.  So for almost any tool or weapon use, our cast iron is functionally worthless: too brittle to sustain meaningful stress.  <strong>But we’re not done.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The key technique that Chinese ironworkers seemed to have developed here is <em>malleablisation</em>.</strong>  By heating the iron to melting temperatures (or just below) in an oxidizing environment (which is to say, open to the air) the ironworker can cause a few things to happen.  First, the oxidation process begins to draw off the carbon from the iron (again, you will remember the tendency of heat and air to decarburize iron from<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/09/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-iva-steel-yourself/"> our discussion of making steel</a>).  At the same time, the graphite which originally was in long, thin flakes begins to form into more compact round shapes which cause less strain on the metal (there is also just <em>less</em> of that graphite, because it is made of the carbon that the air is drawing off in the decarburization process).  If the iron is kept hot and open to the air long enough, it can either be decarburized to steel or even all of the way to wrought iron, making it usable for tools, weapons, armor and the like.</p>



<p>(I should note that somewhat different processes for removing carbon to make cast iron workable as wrought iron, called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finery_forge">fining</a></strong>, emerged in late medieval Europe.  This was done at a finery forge (we start to see these as early as the 13th century AD in Europe and involving breaking cast iron into smaller chunks and then heating …</p></div></div>

<p>HP never stopped innovating. From its origins in the 1930s as a leading electronics manufacturer to its role in the birth of PCs and performance servers, it has always demonstrated incredible ingenuity.</p>
<p>Today, that ingenuity is deployed in service of evil ink-based fuckery.</p>
<p>The printer-ink business model has always been a form of commercial sadism in which you are expected to put giant manufacturers' interests ahead of your own with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>After all, when your profits depend on charging more for ink than vintage Veuve-Clicquot, you need to get up to some serious shenanigans to get your customers to drain their bank accounts to fill their printers.</p>
<p>By contemporary standards, the opening hostilities in the ink-wars look positively quaint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing special half-full cartridges to ship with new printers so their owners have to buy a new set just days after the open the box
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring frequent "calibration" printouts that use vast amounts of ink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gimmicking cartridges' sensors to declare them "empty" even when there's still ink in them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing is, all of this just makes official printer ink less desirable and fuels demand for third party ink.</p>
<p>For this to work, you need to win a two-front war: one on your customers and the other on your competitors. HP is fighting both.</p>
<p>First they pioneered the use of DRM to detect and prevent third-party ink.</p>
<p>Then when ink makers started making their own chips, or harvesting chips out of discarded cartridges to use in new ones, HP got US customs to seize the product, calling it a patent infringement.</p>
<p>But the real ugliness started in March 2016, when HP pushed out a fake "security update" for inkjet printers. Owners who ran the update saw nothing, just a software version number that went up by one.</p>
<p>What they didn't know was that they've been given an asymptomatic infection – a malicious update that only kicked in five months later, after everyone had had a good long time to update. That update's real purpose was to detect and reject third party ink.</p>
<p>It went off right after school started, stranding cash-strapped parents with a year's worth of ink for their kids' school projects. People were outraged. HP issued a nonpology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers</a></p>
<p>(One year later, they did it again)</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739">https://gizmodo.com/one-year-after-bricking-third-party-ink-with-update-hp-1809073739</a></p>
<p>Every time HP got caught doing something evil, they had the same excuse: "that's the deal we offered and you accepted it."</p>
<p>For example, if the box says "Works best with HP ink," then you are "agreeing" that it might not work with other ink. Nevermind that the only reason your printer doesn't work with other ink is that HP tricked you into downgrading it so that the ink stopped working.</p>
<p>This is the grifter's all-purpose excuse: "If you didn't want me to rip you off, then why did you click 'I agree'?"</p>
<p>HP was just getting started, though. In the ideal world, you wouldn't even own your printer ink, you'd just <em>rent</em> it.</p>
<p>Enter HP Instant Ink.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c03760650</a></p>
<p>This  is "ink as a service." You pre-commit to printing a certain number of pages/month and they mail you ink, which they own. You're not buying the ink, you're buying the right to use it.</p>
<p>If you don't print your quota in a month, some of the pages roll over, but they don't let you bank more than a few months' worth – and to keep those pages, you have to keep paying for your sub. Meanwhile, if you blow through your limit, you get charged for every page.</p>
<p>This is a weird and unpalatable idea, so to sell it, HP rolled out a pay-on-price "Free Ink for Life" plan that gave you 15 pages every month for as long as you owned your printer.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/s1105906_sc7.jpeg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/s1105906_sc7.jpeg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>But this is HP we're talking about, so words have no meaning. Last month, HP notified its "free ink for life" customers that their life had ended, and they were being moved to a new afterlife where they had to pay $0.99/month, forever, or else.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/hpreneges2.jpg?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>This Darth Vader "Pray I don't alter it further" shit is the most on-brand HP thing ever</p>
<p>Worse still are the many imitators HP inspires – all those companies that have decided that it's your solemn duty to arrange your affairs to suit their shareholders' needs.</p>
<p>The right-to-repair criminals like Apple, John Deere and Medtronic. Tesla and GM, Juicero and Keurig – companies that are not merely content with waging war on customers, but also on competitors who offer those customers shelter.</p>
<p>Since the turn of this century, HP has been shedding its productive business units that make useful products, and focusing its legal and engineering departments on innovations in shitty dystopian hack-futurism.</p>

<p><em>In the age of productivity and endless distractions, your ability to stay focused on a task for prolonged periods of time is essential for both your economic state and self-worth. The more you’re able to repeal against the distractions that are trying to robe you from your focus, the more you’ll make progress on important tasks. This will lead to higher incomes and give you a sense of completion. But battling disturbing noises</em> <em>is almost impossible not because of our phones, it’s because our mind has the tendency to self-generate thoughts that are unrelated to the current task.</em></p>



<p>Our conscious experience is unstable. We can rarely stay focused on a single topic for extended periods of time. And although modern distractions are contributing to our inability to concentrate, the most significant aspect of our vulnerable concentration is explained by the concept of mind-wandering.</p>



<p>You can’t <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/how-to-read-more-books/" target="_blank" aria-label="read a book (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">read a book</a> not because you don’t understand the words inside, but because your mind is constantly producing a web of thoughts that are totally different from the current task.</p>



<p>Failure to realize when your mind-wanders and your inability to capture a fleeting conscious, train it, and re-focus it, is costly. You’ll always be late with tasks and your overall concentration will suffer.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll explore what is mind-wandering, how can you use it to your advantage and how can you reduce the drifting attention so you can boost your productivity.</p>







<h2>What is Mind-Wandering?</h2>



<p>What happens in our mind is often not related to what we’re experiencing, here and now. Mind-wandering is the ability of the brain to generate thoughts that are unrelated, or somehow related to what we’re actually doing <em>right now</em>.</p>



<p>As stated in a recent study, “when the mind wanders, attention drifts from its current train of thought (often an external task) to mental content generated by the individual rather than cued by the environment.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-12049"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12049" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015331&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;The Science of Mind Wandering: Empirically Navigating the Stream of Consciousness (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>The Science of Mind Wandering: Empirically Navigating the Stream of Consciousness</a>; Vol. 66:487-518 (Volume publication date January 2015)."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>These self-generated thoughts can be categorized as task related as well as task unrelated.</p>

<p>And if you think that you don’t ever fall under the time-wasting <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/rich-dads-cashflow-quadrant/" target="_blank" aria-label="quadrants (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">quadrants</a>, studies on the subject indicate that we spend up to 50% of our waking hours thinking about things that are not related to our current activity.<span id="easy-footnote-2-12049"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-12049" title="<a aria-label=&quot;How pervasive is mind wandering, really? (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323431598_How_pervasive_is_mind_wandering_really&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>How pervasive is mind wandering, really?</a>; Kane et al. 2007, Killingsworth &amp;amp; Gilbert 2010"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>



<p>This means that our ability to self-generate thoughts is not only an inseparable part of our daily lives, it’s basically how half of our lives are lived. And since what we think is basically what we actually experience, understanding how, why, and when the mind-wanders is going to help you understand more deeply yourself.</p>







<h2>Why The Mind-Wanders and Why It’s Important to Understand?</h2>



<p>First, let’s take a look at why the mind-wanders:</p>



<p>The most common reason our minds are racing and looking for different things to engage in is how we perceive the current task. If the outcome of what we’re doing right now, is considered with low value, we’ll automatically seek to find another goal that is with higher value – or at least something that can give us a faster outcome.<span id="easy-footnote-3-12049"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-12049" title="Neuroscience of Consciousness, <a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2019/1/niz014/5602511#165098552&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Volume 2019 (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Volume 2019</a>, Issue 1, 2019."><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>



<p>For example, the outcome of <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/how-to-read-a-book/" target="_blank" aria-label="reading a lengthy book (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading a lengthy book</a> comes after you’ve finished the book – or at least that how most people think. So, naturally, if you’re just starting, the perceived end result, and gain, will probably take a week, or more – depending on how fast you read. Once you realize that the present goal is not going to produce <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" aria-label="immediate results (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediate results</a>, we conclude (unconsciously) that it’s much wiser to stop reading and start doing something with a faster outcome – <a href="https://durmonski.com/life-advice/why-i-quit-social-media/" target="_blank" aria-label="check social media (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">check social media</a> for example.</p>



<p>All of this happens without our conscious consent. Simply the mind does some calculations in the background and forces us to direct our thoughts towards tasks that give us immediate results.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, there are two other things that are common escape routes for the mind: past-related thoughts and future thinking. These two are the common paths our mind takes to disengage from the current task.</p>



<p>Let’s review them in short:</p>



<p>Unhappiness and past problems, or current, which are again based on past experiences, stray our minds towards past events. For example, if you’re worried about your job because you failed to deliver a report on time, your mind will jump back in time and play events that are related to this line of thought.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the future-thinking model is more related to happy feelings. If we’re working on a <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/the-three-year-rule/" target="_blank" aria-label="long-term goal (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term goal</a>, you’ll often think about the possible happy outcomes. If you’re <a href="https://durmonski.com/business/1000-true-fans-theory/" target="_blank" aria-label="starting a business (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting a business</a> or if you have a scheduled vacation, you’ll interrupt your tasks with thoughts about the joyful moments that are yet to come.</p>



<p>With the above being said, the importance of acknowledging mind-wandering is pretty obvious. If we don’t control our thoughts we’ll constantly find ourselves thinking about tasks that are not in line with that we’re doing. And since we’ll think about happy or not so things, we will never successfully do the work that is required of us at the moment.</p>







<h2>How is Mind-Wandering Influencing Our Lives?</h2>



<p>Apart from forcing us to think about I-can’t-believe-I-did-this type of events that can lead to depression, the other most common downside of this unfocused way of thinking is <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/how-to-become-more-productive-and-less-lazy/" target="_blank" aria-label="reduced productivity (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced productivity</a>.</p>



<p>When you’re unable to control your line of thought, you’ll constantly start over and spend hours doing the simplest activities.</p>



<p>But spending an hour to write a simple “Thank You” email is nothing compared to the following consequence…</p>



<p>In our daily lives, the most dangerous result of our tendency to constantly self-generate thoughts is when we drive. If we’re not 100% focused on the road and on what is happening around us, we can make wrong decisions – or even worse, not make a decision at all when we have to – which can lead to bad consequences. And while thinking about what you want to eat while you steer the wheel might not be so bad, we have a tendency to completely detach ourselves from the current realm and go to another, imaginary place.</p>



<p>This important aspect of mind-wandering is called perceptual decoupling. In this state, we completely disengaging from what is happening here and now. We focus on internal desires and pay little, or no attention to what’s happening around us. Zoning out is a way to understand this distracted state of the mind.</p>

<p>And if during mind-wandering you’re just thinking about doing something else, when in perceptual decoupling you’re basically imagining a whole new world.</p>



<p>The consequences as mentioned can be quite devastating. From not doing your job on time to not paying attention to the road when you’re driving.</p>







<h2><strong>How Can You Reduce Mind-Wandering?</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t completely shut off-task thoughts. What you can do though, to <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/the-one-thing-principle/">increase your productivity</a> and to make sure you’re concentrated while performing important tasks such as driving, is to direct (on time) your focus on the activities that are happening here and now.</p>



<p>Here are some things you can practice to reduce wandering of the mind and improve your focus:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increase difficulty</strong>: Tasks that are nearly automated and require little mental effort from your side are mind-wandering incubators. If the current task can’t challenge your thinking you’ll immediately start thinking about other things. The easiest way to concentrate and decrease the number of off-topic thoughts that circle in your mind is to increase the difficultly of the task. To engage in works that are more demanding.</li><li><strong>Social pressure</strong>: Another way to manipulate your concentration, in a good way, is to put yourself in front of others. When we’re exposed, we have the ability to concentrate. For example, public speaking is a form of social stress that will force you to focus. If you have to make a presentation, or if you publicly declare that you’ll do something, the social stress and the fear of being publicly ashamed will arm you with the power to focus and do your job. In addition to this, you can consider “getting” an accountability partner. Get someone watch over your shoulder and “check-in” with you regularly to see how you’re progressing.</li><li><strong>Journaling</strong>: Current or past problems, if not 100% solved, are constantly present in the back of our mind, stealing our attention and hurting our mood negatively. When there are important tasks or problems that are pending, the best way to get them off your head is by writing them down. The act of writing what needs to be done will liberate you from the constant thoughts associated with this problem or situation.</li><li><strong>Meta-awareness</strong>: The role meta-awareness plays when your mind is drifting is huge. The faster you “catch” yourself drifting, the faster you’ll bring your mind back to the task at hand. Letting your mind wanders for long periods of time will greatly reduce your performance. And if you let your mind carelessly explore off-topics when you actually need to work you’ll turn this into a nasty habit. When you realize that you’re zoning out, you can write down what you’re thinking about on a piece of paper and move on with your task. The act of writing will give a physical shape to your thoughts and let them out. Overall, meta-awareness is nothing more than realizing that you’re slacking off and bringing your mind back to your tasks.</li></ul>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I heard before that Erlang and the BEAM did not pack a static type system
because their creators <em>“couldn’t build it”</em>.</p>
<p>That is nonsense.</p>
<p>While building a sophisticated, reliable and scalable type checker is
absolutely not a walk in the park, building one that works is not that hard.</p>
<p>If it could have been done, it would’ve been done, and it would’ve been
hardened by the same process OTP was hardened and turned into what it is today:
a reliability gold standard.</p>
<p>So I decided to write an Erlang type-checker to really understand what is hard
about typing Erlang. I know Dialyzer exists, and its great, I just wanted to
get a good understanding from scratch.</p>
<p>It hit me that there is a split in here, that is sometimes hard to notice and
it makes a world of a difference. There is <strong>an Erlang language</strong>, called
Standard Erlang, and there is <strong>an Erlang Runtime</strong>, the BEAM. Along the same
lines as there is a Java language, and then there’s the JVM.</p>
<p>We tend to speak of these 2 things as if they were one, but if we isolate the
language from the runtime, we find that they exhibit very different behaviors.</p>
<p>In particular the runtime brings to the table <em>distribution</em> and  <em>hot code
reloading</em>, which makes typing things a distributed-systems problem. Fun, yes,
but very impractical.</p>
<p>On following essays I’ll do a more thorough and formal treatise of the
operational semantics of the language and how to go about implementing your own
type-checker for it, the distributed and dynamic nature of the runtime, and how
they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Here I’ll go over what I’ve learned takes to type the Standard Erlang in a more
superficial way, and what are some thorny parts that we will encounter.</p>
<p>First, lets scope what actually <em>is</em> Standard Erlang.</p>
<h2>Standard Erlang</h2>
<p>Erlang is a dynamically, strongly typed language. It includes just a little
extra over your typical functional programming language. Overall, Erlang isn’t
<a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/stdlib/src/erl_parse.yrl">that big a
language</a>.</p>
<p>My eye-ball estimation is that it is about a 3rd of the size of OCaml, and
about a 5th of the size of Java.</p>
<p>Here’s some Erlang:</p>
<pre><code>% an erlang module
-module(hello_world).

-export([hi/1]).  % &lt;-- this a compiler annotation

hi(noone) -&gt; sad;
hi(Name) -&gt; &lt;&lt;"Hello, ", (Name)/binary, "!"&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>An Erlang program consists of a number of <code>modules</code>, each module is just a file
with a bunch of <code>functions</code> in it and a few <code>annotations</code> used to tell the
compiler what’s exported, who the module author is, what a function type is
supposed to be, etc.</p>
<p>There’s quite a few things you can write in Erlang that are relatively common:</p>
<ul>
<li>literals like booleans, numbers or strings</li>
<li>lists, maps, tuples, lambdas</li>
<li>ifs, try/catch, case</li>
<li>function calls and references</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s a few things that aren’t common at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>atoms, which are just constants</li>
<li>receive expressions</li>
<li>all sorts of pattern matching</li>
<li>everything is done through recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>But in general, the language expressivity comes from it being rather simple.
Most problems are solved by making functions that call each other, most
functions pattern match on exactly the data they need, loops are achieved
through recursion, and we’re done.</p>
<p>Exceptions are very common, since failing to pattern match will result in an
exception. For this the language supports the <code>catch</code>, and <code>try..catch..after</code>
expressions, but it is highly unidiomatic to use them.</p>
<p>The superb uptime through supervision that Erlang is known for is actually
baked into the runtime, not the language. The language itself has no notion of
processes, links, or sending messages. The only thing it does have is <em>receive</em>
expressions for <em>consuming messages</em>.</p>
<p>Armed with this understanding, lets dig into how we could type Erlang.</p>
<h2>Typing the Erlang Language</h2>
<p>In writing the type-checker, I’ve found a few things that are worth bringing up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions on Untagged Unions</li>
<li>Functions on Records</li>
<li>Functions on Tagged Unions (Variants)</li>
<li>Receive Expressions</li>
<li>Dynamic Dispatch and <code>M:F(A)</code> syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be other language constructs that are not friendly to static
analysis. I’ll try to write and cover more in the future.</p>
<h3>1. Functions on Untagged Unions</h3>
<p>An Erlang value can have a single type but we expect that type to be known only
at runtime. This means that both the input and returning types of a function
are actually unknown <em>until</em> we run the function.</p>
<p>So whenever you see a function like <code>hi/1</code> above, calling it could actually
return a value of different types, depending on how the function was written.</p>
<p>For example, calling <code>hi(noone)</code> returns the atom <code>sad</code>. Instead, calling
<code>hi(&lt;&lt;"Joe"&gt;&gt;)</code> returns the string <code>&lt;&lt;"Hello, Joe!"&gt;&gt;</code>. The atom <code>sad</code> and the
string have different types. Calling <code>hi(0)</code> will result in an exception.</p>
<p>If we were to write down the type of this function we’d have to say something
like:</p>
<pre><code>hi(atom("noone") | string) -&gt; atom("sad") | string
</code></pre>
<p>This is present in every other dynamic language: Lisp, Lua, Javascript, Python,
Ruby, Smalltalk, you name it.</p>
<p>Writing a type-checker that deals with this is certainly possible, as it has
been done before in tools like <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/flow-type">Flow</a> and <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/typescript">TypeScript</a>,
but it certainly isn’t obvious how to.</p>
<p>To better understand how this can be dealt with, we need to talk about <a href="https://abstractmachines.dev/posts/union-types">Union
Types</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Union types</strong> allow us to express that a value may belong to one of many
different types at the same time. E.g, <code>1</code> is a <code>number</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>. In the same way, <code>true</code> is a <code>bool</code>, but it is also a
<code>(number | bool)</code>.</p>
<p>We read <code>(number | bool)</code> as “number or bool”.</p>
<p>The key here is that the value itself doesn’t have explicit information about
which type from the union it actually belongs to, and we’re bound to find this
out through <em>refinements</em>.</p>
<p>We can do these refinements in 2 ways through the use of guards and pattern
matching.</p>

<p><strong>Through the use of guards</strong> we can refine the actual type of a value into a
single type. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% the infamous left_pad function
left_pad(A, B) when is_binary(A) -&gt; &lt;&lt;(A)/binary, (B)/binary&gt;&gt;;
left_pad(A, B) when is_number(A) -&gt; left_pad(binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A), B).
</code></pre>
<p>This function is has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>left_pad( string | number, string ) -&gt; string
</code></pre>
<p>But it is thanks to the guards <code>is_binary/1</code> and <code>is_number/1</code> that we <em>refine</em>
the type of the inputs to be just <code>string</code> or just <code>number</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to say that <code>binary:copy(&lt;&lt;" "&gt;&gt;, A)</code> is safe, because
at that point we know that <code>is_number(A)</code> was true, and so <code>A</code>’s type has been
refined from <code>string | number</code> to just <code>number</code>. Otherwise the guard would have
been false.</p>
<p>However, we can’t use any function as a guard. We must use only built-in
functions that already come with the Erlang runtime.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible to write arbitrary refinement logic, which makes the
approach rather limited.</p>

<p><strong>Through pattern matching</strong> we can do something very similar, and establish
our expectations of the values. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% a good old list length counter
count(A=[_|_]) -&gt; count(A, 0).

count([], C) -&gt; C;
count([_|T], C) -&gt; count(T, C+1).
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we are guaranteed that if our function pattern matches, then <code>A</code>
will be a list.</p>
<p>We don’t really know what the list elements are, but of course we can try and
continue pattern matching and using guards until we refine it “enough”.</p>
<p>These two approaches, while composable, have the unfortunate property that they
don’t generalize to all kinds of data. They should work well tho for: atoms,
literals, and anything that there is a guard available for.</p>
<p>Anything where our data is one of type <em>or</em> another, would fall into this
category.</p>
<p>Maps, tuples, and records can work with this, but it doesn’t scale very well.
You essentially have to add the new map/tuple/record name to the union every
time you want it supported. Even if you need a single field out of them.</p>
<p>In the next section we’ll see a different approach for dealing with this data
that scales much better.</p>
<h3>2. Functions on Record Types</h3>
<p>When working with functions that take as inputs many values packed into one, be
it with records, maps, or tuples, we’re faced with a different issue: we don’t
care what the input type is <em>as long as it has what we need in it</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if we have two possible maps that share some things, both of them
could be thought of as their own separate type, and these 2 types would have
something in common.</p>
<pre><code>% this has type 'character'
Character = #{ name =&gt; "Alexander Hamilton", play =&gt; "Hamilton" }.

% this has type 'performer'
Performer = #{ name =&gt; "Lin-Manuel Miranda" }.
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we make a function to get the name of a Performer:</p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name := Name }) -&gt; Name.
</code></pre>
<p>and we give it a type:</p>
<pre><code>name(performer) -&gt; string.
</code></pre>
<p>Would we expect this function to work on Characters?</p>
<p>My answer is yes, since Characters also have a <code>name</code> fields.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d say that it will work just fine for any map <em>as long as it has a
name key that is a string</em>.</p>
<p>So the type of our function isn’t quite <code>(character | performer)</code>. It actually
is “Any map as long as it has a name key that is a string”. I’ll use this
notation for that: <code>#{ name }</code></p>
<pre><code>name(#{ name : A }) -&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>Some type-systems support this with Structural Subtyping, some others use Row
Polymorphism. The main difference isn’t obvious in this getter function, but
becomes obvious in the next one, a setter:</p>
<pre><code>with_name(Name, M=#{ name := _ }) -&gt; M#{ name =&gt; Name }.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The structural subtyping approach</strong> would say that whatever you put in, it is
now known to only have a <code>name</code> key. So all your other keys have disappeared
(to the eyes of the type-system) and if you want to recover them you have to do
some sort of casting. This is due to a subtyping behavior called <em>subsumption</em>
and its the way that TypeScript handles this.</p>
<p><strong>The row polymorphic approach</strong> has no information loss, and instead carries
around the rest of the fields that <code>M</code> had. This is how OCaml and PureScript
handles this. In PureScript this works for record types and in OCaml this is</p></section></section></div>

Some more options will be covered in later chapters, but not all of them are discussed in this book.</p><h2><a href="#executing-perl-code" id="executing-perl-code">Executing Perl code</a></h2><p>If you want to execute a <code>perl</code> program file, one way is to pass the filename as argument to the <code>perl</code> command.</p><pre><code>$ echo 'print "Hello Perl\n"' &gt; hello.pl
$ perl hello.pl
Hello Perl
</code></pre><p>For short programs, you can also directly pass the code as an argument to the <code>-e</code> or <code>-E</code> options. See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/feature">perldoc: feature</a> for details about the features enabled by the <code>-E</code> option.</p><pre><code>$ perl -e 'print "Hello Perl\n"'
Hello Perl

$ # multiple statements can be issued separated by ;
$ # -l option will be covered in detail later, appends \n to 'print' here
$ perl -le '$x=25; $y=12; print $x**$y'
59604644775390625
$ # or, use -E and 'say' instead of -l and 'print'
$ perl -E '$x=25; $y=12; say $x**$y'
59604644775390625
</code></pre><h2><a href="#filtering" id="filtering">Filtering</a></h2><p><code>perl</code> one-liners can be used for filtering lines matched by a regexp, similar to <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code>. And similar to many command line utilities, <code>perl</code> can accept input from both <code>stdin</code> and file arguments.</p><pre><code>$ # sample stdin data
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n'
gate
apple
what
kite

$ # print all lines containing 'at'
$ # same as: grep 'at' and sed -n '/at/p' and awk '/at/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | perl -ne 'print if /at/'
gate
what

$ # print all lines NOT containing 'e'
$ # same as: grep -v 'e' and sed -n '/e/!p' and awk '!/e/'
$ printf 'gate\napple\nwhat\nkite\n' | perl -ne 'print if !/e/'
what
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> will automatically loop over input content line by line (with <code>\n</code> as the line distinguishing character). The <code>-n</code> or <code>-p</code> option will enable this feature for <code>perl</code>. <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/using-modules.html#convert-one-liners-to-pretty-formatted-scripts">O module</a> section shows the code Perl runs with these options.</p><p>As seen before, the <code>-e</code> option accepts code as command line argument. Many shortcuts are available to reduce the amount of typing needed. In the above examples, a regular expression (defined by the pattern between a pair of forward slashes) has been used to filter the input. When the input string isn't specified, the test is performed against special variable <code>$_</code>, which has the contents of the current input line here (the correct term would be input <strong>record</strong>, see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/record-separators.html#record-separators">Record separators</a> chapter). <code>$_</code> is also the default argument for many functions like <code>print</code> and <code>say</code>. To summarize:</p><ul><li><code>/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ =~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li><li><code>!/REGEXP/FLAGS</code> is a shortcut for <code>$_ !~ m/REGEXP/FLAGS</code></li></ul><blockquote><p><img src="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/images/info.svg" alt="info"> See <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#m/PATTERN/msixpodualngc">perldoc: match</a> for help on <code>m</code> operator.

<p><strong>4 November 2020 | Luis F. De Pombo, David Ellis</strong></p>
<p>Can we write programs with predictable execution that could be automatically parallelized? Part of the work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a> demonstrated that for some programs it cannot be determined ahead of time whether or not the program can be computed. This constitutes the crux of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">Halting Problem</a>. This "Turing-Completeness Problem" is not an issue with what they have shown, but how the software development process is hindered by the lack of assurances on computability and our industry's lack of recognition of the burden this has put onto software developers. Further, it has been exacerbated by recent computing mechanisms, such as multithreading, NUMA, GPGPU, and distributed computing, which have moved away from the "single tape" Turing Machine model of computation that most programming languages are founded upon.</p>
<p>The following snippet of C code succinctly contains the problems of Turing completeness complicating modern development:</p>
<pre><code>while (node) {
  doSomethingWith(node);
  node = node-&gt;next;
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><em>Automatic Parallelization</em> - It's not possible to automatically parallelize this code. The number of nodes is not clear to the compiler for it to potentially bunch those calls across threads, and it's also unclear if the function call mutates the node and adds/removes nodes to process.</li>
<li><em>Halting Problem</em> - It's not possible to know if the code will halt, even ignoring the idea that <code>doSomethingWith</code> may always add a new <code>node</code> to the one it is processing, there's nothing stopping a node from pointing at itself and never halting that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Automatic parallelization is only a problem because we want/need to parallelize our code. Until very recently this was a niche need as <a href="https://www.karlrupp.net/2015/06/40-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/">computing power had been increasing exponentially for decades and has only flattened in the past decade</a>. If this was still the case it is likely that it would have remained a niche problem that only experts need to worry about, but with multicore now the norm even in personal laptops and unlikely to go away as <a href="http://www.fisgeo.unipg.it/luca.gammaitoni/fisinfo/documenti-fisici/physical-limits-silicon.pdf">signal propagation itself becomes the limiting factor</a>, it has become a problem for the average developer, as well.</p>
<p>The issue with the Halting Problem itself is much more contentious. Turing demonstrated that it is not possible to determine whether arbitrary compute will halt or run forever so this lack of determinism has been tolerated as an unfortunate reality of all compute that must simply be dealt with. However, we posit that no <em>practially useful</em> computation will take forever because its result cannot affect the finite reality of our lives, so programmers have already been finding an imperfect subset of Turing completeness for their own problem domains in an ad-hoc intuitive sense to be able to actually produce valuable calculations for their users.</p>
<p>In a single-threaded world, this problem has been mostly a small annoyance -- on those occasions where you have written infinitely-looping code, find the section of code that the processor is executing over and over again, study how it entered this state, and figure out how to prevent that state from occurring again -- or abort on detection of said state. But in a multi-threaded, multi-machined cluster computing world, on those occasions where you have written an infinite loop, even detecting an infinite loop that spans multiple machines is a challenge, let alone gathering the data you need to debug the cause of this invalid state. This is further exacerbated by the non-determinism inherent to multiple interacting Turing machines not executing in lockstep with each other making reproduction of the problem even more difficult.</p>
<p>Side-stepping the Halting Problem by defining a barely-Turing-incomplete subset, also makes the automatic parallelization story possible. Now the compiler can work with code that it can determine where and how it could parallelize the work and has the ability to model its finite execution time to determine whether or not parallelization is worth it under various conditions.</p>
<p>This is the thesis of <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">the Alan programming language</a>, that with minor syntax constraints (that we believe the vast majority of developers will not notice, or at least won't mind) we can be sure that the code you write always halts, and we can parallelize your code for you. We can make models for runtime estimates at compile time that only require the size and "shape" of the data to get an answer and can therefore determine not only how to parallelize your code, but whether or not it makes sense given the data being operated on. We have not yet accomplished all of these claims, but this is now only a matter of time and effort. :)</p>
<p>The root of most of the problems with the example C code involves the ambiguity in the data structure and the behavior of the user-defined function. The other problem is that the while loop is an unbounded looping construct that cannot be reasoned about except "the body of the while loop is executed zero or more times." In Alan, <em>arbitrary</em> looping and recursion are disallowed, and all data is built on top of data types with knowable constraints, no arbitrary JUMP statements or data pointer logic allowed.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that instead of writing that while loop above for your list of nodes, you would write something like:</p>
<pre><code>nodes.each(doSomethingWith)
</code></pre>
<p>Your intent to perform a side-effect action on each of the nodes in the list is clear, and the Alan compiler can determine the "purity" of the function -- whether or not it mutates the input argument or an outer scope -- to determine if it <em>could</em> execute the operations in parallel. Then at runtime it can use the estimated execution time of the function, the number of nodes in the <code>nodes</code> array, and the cost to distribute that work across multiple threads, to decide <em>if</em> it will execute the operations in parallel.</p>
<p>This can even apply across simple sequentially-written lines of code:</p>
<pre><code>fn example(file1: string, file2: string): Array&lt;Array&lt;int64&gt;&gt; {
  const matrix1 = loadFile(file1).parseMatrix()
  const matrix2 = loadFile(file2).parseMatrix()
  return matrix1 * matrix2
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is the matrix multiplication a trivially parallelizable operation that likely will be parallelized for any large-ish matrix, but reading the files from disk and then parsing their contents may be done in parallel before the matrix multiplication because the performance benefit is there to do so.</p>
<p>To accomplish automatic parallelization, we need something different from a classic Turing tape to compile to. We call this the Alan Graphcode: a bytecode format with graph annotations that is guaranteed to have no cycles. A dependency graph of operations to perform, with some of these also having a subgraph of operations to perform, provides us with the information we need to know which operations are safe to execute in parallel, coupled with (implied) operation execution time estimates to determine if it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p>Alan's acyclic graphcode seems incompatible with any sort of control flow at first glance, though, since a dependency graph of operations that must all be executed appears to preclude the behavior of <code>JUMP</code> operations, like the classic <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/X86-assembly/Instructions/jnz">JNZ (Jump if Not Zero)</a>. <a href="https://github.com/alantech/alan">Alan</a> allows <code>if</code> statements and even <a href="https://docs.alan-lang.org/std_seq.html">guaranteed halting versions of classic looping constructs are in a standard library</a> that provide a predictable "worst case" execution time based on a maximum iteration count allowed. We will demonstrate how Alan allows control flow with a graph-based representation that makes automatic parallelization possible.</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-tape.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ"></p>
<p>Here two operations <code>OP1</code> and <code>OP2</code> run, then a <code>JNZ</code> runs. If the check is not zero, it skips to only run <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>, otherwise it runs <code>OP3</code> and <code>OP4</code> before running <code>OP5</code> and <code>OP6</code>.</p>
<p>This is a basic if statement for something like:</p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
if (b) {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
}
var d = op5(a);
return op6(d);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent representation in a graph would be something like:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-if.png" alt="Graph Example with if"></p>
<p>Here, the conditional call is a special <code>COND</code> node that may or may not execute the specified graph named <code>if</code>. All of the nodes of the main graph are executed, but the <code>COND</code> operation may or may not execute the inner subgraph. There is absolutely no parallelization possible based on the set of dependencies, but it's clear that <code>OP5</code> can't run until both <code>OP1</code> and <code>COND(if)</code> are run.</p>
<p>Back to classic Turing machines, what is the opposite of an <code>if</code> statement in a Turing tape? It's not <code>else if</code> or <code>else</code> as those are just other forward jumps on different conditions. The opposite of an <code>if</code> is a <code>do-while</code> statement, because that is a jump <em>backwards</em>. </p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/turing-loop.png" alt="Turing Tape Example with JNZ-based loop"></p>
<pre><code>var a = op1();
var b = op2(a);
do {
  var c = op3();
  a = op4(c);
  var d = op5(a);
} while (d);
op6(a);
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent in a graph representation would be:</p>
<p><img src="https://alan-lang.org/graph-loop.png" alt="Graph Example with do-while loop"></p>
<p>Here a <code>DOWHILE</code> opcode runs the loop sub-graph over and over until the expected condition is met. So with these two special opcodes <code>COND</code> and <code>DOWHILE</code> we can reproduce the behavior of <code>JNZ</code>'s forwards and backwards jumping and we can enter infinite loops with <code>DOWHILE</code>, meaning we should be Turing Complete.</p>
<p>So how do we make this barely <em>not</em> Turing complete? We make a list/array type a first class citizen in the VM itself and then we only add operations that know the bounds that they are to operate on based on that list or some other condition that cannot be <em>directly</em> mutated by the user's own code.</p>
<p>Now for an array of data we can have an <code>each</code> opcode that applies a given sub-graph of operations to every node in the array. The Alan runtime, or AVM, can tell based on the expected execution time of the graph and the number of nodes and the cost to send that data to multiple threads whether or not to do a fork-join or not. Probably no for 10 elements and probably yes for 10 billion, but where's the threshold and why? That's something better left for a computer to decide in realtime …</p></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why are 'cold emails' ... cold?</p>
<p>That's because <a href="https://akhilkg.me/blog/serendipity">serendipity</a> in real-life comes at a premium. </p>
<p>You have to be at the right place, at the right time to strike gold. You will need to jump over loops, be able to get favours, tackle people and conversations to get what you want - and in the end, this would just get you a 1-2 minute conversation with someone important. The fancy term for this is “warm introductions”.</p>
<p>'Online' serendipity - like many things 'online' - is straightforward. You are "only” an email away from a potential investor, a mentor, or a customer. </p>
<p>Nothing beats getting a warm introduction to someone but cold emails don't have to be "cold". They can be warm. </p>
<p>Let me give you two personal examples of not-so-cold emails - one which worked and one which didn’t. The emails went to two of my favourite startup people when I was trying to collect and organise my thoughts around an idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your 'warm' emails should take you a lot of time to write, which is good. Each email has its own set of characteristics depending on whom you are sending it to  i.e. here, your motive with warm emails is to build a long term relationship with the person you are sending it to.</p>
<p>And so, the receiver should feel that you have done your homework and you are not someone who is just sending the same mail to a lot of people and expecting to get a response.</p>
<p>At its heart, it's just talking your heart out - nothing else. No fancy salesmanship or trying to impress. </p>
<p>The best warm emails are honest, actionable, and waste no time for the reader. There is no fluff nor beating around the bush and ideally, it wouldn’t even cross 2 or 3 paragraphs.</p>
<p>For my first mail that worked, it started with an incredibly personal and heartfelt message. I had been following this person's content for last 5-6 years or so. He has had an impact on my viewpoint of the world much more than any other figure at the time and I believe it was his answers that sowed the seeds for entrepreneurship early on.</p>
<p>The best warm emails you will write will be automatically for the people who you believe the most in,- you will be at the most genuine, honest version of yourself  - just like how water flows inevitably through a bed of rocks - this works almost always.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252728-44892880-1fa0-11eb-90f9-d9f2ef37bf65.jpg"></p><p>Watch the subject line, it is eye-catching. From his perspective, it’s actually relatable. The receiver in this case is a popular writer on Quora and as was described in one of his answers - at one point, he was a 'young follower' himself. The rest of the email described my startup where I asked him for his feedback.
This worked and he responded.</p>
<p>Also, note that the platform you use matters a lot. Use the platform where the receiver is less likely to be bombarded by random strangers / where the receiver has a lot of followers. For this guy, the worst place to send him the mail would have been on Quora.</p>
<p>For the one that didn’t work - the principles remained the same but I focused too much on “getting help” rather than “connecting” - it started with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252734-4652ec00-1fa0-11eb-88c2-3ae94eea6e4c.jpg"></p><p>And this was at the end:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/98252740-46eb8280-1fa0-11eb-9c09-dff29cb7ac86.jpg"></p><p>Reading it now, it just feels like a cooked up half-assed effort to get some feedback.</p>
<hr>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the person on a deeper level to whom you are sending to. Read their tweets, read all of their blog posts, see what they have built. Come to appreciate a thing or two about the person whom you are sending it to - you can’t write well if you don’t feel it.</li>
<li>Be genuine &amp; expect nothing and no, not even a response. Sounds counter-intuitive, but it works :) I’m not saying don’t ask for help, ask for help - but at the same time, you should be okay without their help as well. Try your best.</li>
<li>Mind the platform. Use the platform which the person expects something important to come through. You could also try multiple times but don’t spam.</li>
<li>Make sure your content is actionable &amp; clear. Ensure your email/message will be opened from its first line/subject. If you ask for too much, the person might just think “Okay, I will respond to this person later” and you end up never getting a response. Instead, ask for something short and sweet, and from there you can build a conversation.</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<p>In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/databases">part 1</a> of this series, we'll use the Persistent library and Template Haskell to create a simple database schema. This will enable us to run migrations with ease. It will also allow us to write some simple type safe SQL queries!</p>

<p>Once we have our database set up, we'll want to serve the information we're storing over a web API. We'll do this with the Servant library. Servant allows us to build endpoints that retrieve their query parameters in a type-safe way! Find out how in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/servant">part 2</a> of the series!</p>

<p>Now that we have our API set up, we'll see how we can make it faster by adding a Redis cache! We'll learn how to use the Redis bindings for Haskell so we can avoid using the database for some of our queries! See how it all works in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/redis">part 3</a>.</p>

<p>Our end-to-end system is now quite complicated, so testing it is difficult for a variety of reasons. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/docker">part 4</a>, we'll see some techinques to test our web API. We'll also use Docker to make this process easier.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/real-world/esqueleto">final part</a> of our Real World Haskell series, we'll learn some more about advanced SQL queries. We'll extend our schema and use the Esqueleto library to perform type safe joins between our different data types!</p>

<p>This series goes over some cool libraries, but there's still so much more to explore! Check out our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/production-checklist">Production Checklist</a> and explore a ton of other libraries you can use for various tasks when making a production system in Haskell!</p>

		<p>When we started Repl.it, we set out to remove all friction from getting started with programming. That also meant getting out of the way and letting you code as quickly as possible. As part of that, and for a long time, you could start coding on Repl.it without a user account. </p>
<p>We anticipated that giving free unfettered compute to the universe would be challenging. Still we didn't flinch and made it a point to innovate on sandboxing, security, and anti-abuse tools, and we've been largely successful at that. Today, Repl.it the largest open compute platform on the internet, one where you don't need a credit card or even an account to start executing. We run 150,000 concurrent containers, which is 10x what we used to run last year.</p>
<p>We have our fair share of war stories, like when we had to battle dark-web hackers trying to sell DDoS attacks from our site for Bitcoin. Luckily reCAPTCHA from Google was a massive help, protecting against botting made it possible for us to continue to grow and offer our services for free.</p>
<p>Sadly, earlier this year, Google surprised us that they're going to be charging for reCAPTCHA. Of course, it makes business sense for them, but for a startup like ours, operating at the scale we operate at, it meant that we have to pay them more than we make in monthly revenue<small>[1]</small>.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>leave the site vulnerable to botting and attacks resulting in an immense amount of time spent fighting abuse and risking outages</li>
<li>phase out the anonymous experience and focus our efforts and tools on securing the logged-in user experience</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to go with the latter, and we hope you'll stick with us and create an account. Beyond the 5 minutes it takes to sign up, there is only an upside to doing so. We don't collect much data, and we respect user privacy. You're also going to unlock many features that were invisible for you in the anonymous experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and organize your repls</li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">Host apps and websites</a></li>
<li><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Collaborate with others in Multiplayer</a></li>
<li>Claim and build a profile with the repls you're most proud of</li>
<li>Particpate in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/community">community forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more that we're sure you'll enjoy discovering.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Google gave us only one month to move off, so we're going to have to move fast. Here are the changes to expect in the upcoming few weeks: </p>
<ul>
<li>We'll transition our language pages (<code>/languages/{lang_name}</code>) to a barebones REPL with limited opportunity for abuse. That way if you're used to using Repl.it to try out just a bit of code, you can continue to do that without logging in</li>
<li>repl.run, the url endpoint you could access command-line apps will redirect to the repl. repl.run is inherently anonymous, which makes it an attack vector without captcha</li>
<li>finally, you'll have to login to create a repl and save your work</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to openness and instantness -- two principles that have made Repl.it special. I am thrilled to see you on the inside!</p>
<hr>
<p><small>1: it's worth noting that we're already big Google Cloud customers, and our spend only continues to grow with them. </small></p>
