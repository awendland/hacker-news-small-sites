<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>

<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<p>On <em>2020-12-06</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;E-Mail&quot;,&quot;E-Mail-Provider&quot;,&quot;Gerichtsurteil&quot;,&quot;LKA&quot;,&quot;Tutanota&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;,&quot;Ãœberwachung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/ct/ct-inhalt" width="300"></a-ad>



<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

Each application has to look exactly the same, with the same functionality - adding a todo item, marking an item as complete, removing completed items, etc. Every instance of the application needs to be persistent with local storage and feature routing for display all, active or completed todos, and so on. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-5ab1d"><span><span>Here is an example of a TodoMVC application:</span></span></p><div id="viewer-9kpfo"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5isi0"><span><span>In this article we share what we’ve learned from building a TodoMVC application using Stencil.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-7pffh"><span><span>Our finished copy of the complete Stencil TodoMVC application is on GithuB: </span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-2ajfe"><p><span>Github pages - </span><a href="https://yoavaa.github.io/stencil-todo-mvc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>demo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-504l8"><p><span>Github </span><a href="https://github.com/yoavaa/stencil-todo-mvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>repo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-6isa4"><p><span>Pull request for TodoMVC is </span><a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/2130" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>here</u></span></a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-df9em"><span><span>Here’s an equivalent React TodoMVC application for reference:</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-e9k4l"><p><a href="http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC React Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-ce1qk"><span><span>Just for the fun of it, we also added a </span><a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte</u></span></a><span> TodoMVC application for the performance comparison</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-acl7k"><p><a href="http://svelte-todomvc.surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte TodoMVC Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-8a90"><span><span>A side note on Svelte - that’s another framework we’ve considered in the past and one we’re following closely today.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.
As our favorite proverb goes, "you don't need lots of resources when all your content is static and you can get someone else to serve it for free".</p>
<p>We're pretty confident in our ability to scale our infrastructure in the event that more users join the service, as our VPS provider has a button we can press to make the server larger, solving all scalability problems once and for all.</p>
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>"I don't think that this could ever create something that I wouldn't mute" </p><p><em>- Voxel, laying down the hard truths about music generation in general and my music generator in specific</em></p></blockquote><p>In groovelet32.exe, I’d like for the art assets to be capable of wiggling and booping in time with the music. </p><p>That’s seemingly simple sounding, but that simple idea contains, uh, <em>multitudes</em>.</p><p>This can be accomplished in one of a few different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe the music whole into the execution environment and play the music with locally available music generation tools (Tone.js in JavaScript, Helm or wwise in Unity) </p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, transcribe important moments in written music into software language, have instrument hits trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, use automated analysis (Koreographer in Unity) to guess when dynamics are occcuring in the music and use those to trigger effects.</p></li><li><p>Buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using midi engine to drive effects. </p></li><li><p>Generate music entirely in place, have instrument hits directly trigger effects.</p></li></ol><p>Each strategy has its ups and downs. Notably, the first four strategies start with the simple-sounding but imposing “buy, commission, or write music”. Buying music - well, it’s hard to build a whole game around stock music - especially if music is as fundamental to the experience as it should be in a game about musical robots. </p><p>Commissioning music is simply too expensive, if I’m planning on paying my composer fairly (which I would be, if I had any money).</p><p>Writing music on my own would imply a strong upgrade in my own personal music production skills, because currently I’m operating at somewhere near the “Three Blind Mice” level. A number of my family members are talented musically - my younger brother married into a “music teacher” family - but I don’t think any of them have ever cracked open a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>, and they’re pretty busy with their own lives, so that’s a hard tree to shake and expect that video-game ready tunes will fall out.</p><p>So that leaves me with <strong>procedurally generated music</strong>. It’s perhaps naive to think that I, a person who can’t even write a regular song, could build a computer that could write music for me, but hey - if I’m good at anything¹ , it’s programming.</p><h2>A Basic Architecture for Procgen Music</h2><p>Some time back, I watched this inspiring JSConf talk: </p><p id="youtube2-_0ij8vY2gzE" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_0ij8vY2gzE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_0ij8vY2gzE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><em>so cool</em></p><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> “we built a tool called <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce">Magenta.js</a> that allows you to tensorflow up some tunes”</p><p>I like tensorflow! I like tunes!</p><p>Setting upon the task with some zeal I managed to get Magenta.js generating tunes, slowly. I had a simple plan for how I would take slowly-generated 8-second tunes and convert them into longer songs:</p><ol><li><p>Have a background server process generate 8-second three-part-tune clips</p></li><li><p>Use some basic heuristics to guess at the key signature (“C# major”) of the clips, evaluate their intensity (lots of drum hits? loads of notes?) and save them in a huge clip database.</p></li><li><p>Create a search interface for the clip database.</p></li><li><p>Have the client request clips from the server in a specific key and intensity.</p></li><li><p>Weave two or three clips together, repeating them a couple of times, to make a full “song”.</p></li><li><p>Add tools to control the requested key signature, intensity, and change instrument, tempo, and what-have-you at the last second.</p></li><li><p>Take the output and make it sound like real human music that people would listen to on purpose.</p></li></ol><p>Now, there are some definite problems with this scheme. One of them is <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> - an unbelievably powerful synth workbench written for people who have read<a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book-html/"> the entire book on Digital Signal Processing</a>, and <em>no other people</em>.</p><p>I actually took and passed a senior-level course in DSP for music generation, some 12 years ago. I have less of an excuse than the average person to be absolutely garbage at attaching oscillators to things. I’m still garbage, mind you, I just have less of an excuse.</p><p>Anyways, after some serious effort, I got steps 1-6 working.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1c57c1-7653-4b87-af3b-44ec32498063_624x749.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:749,&quot;width&quot;:624,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Look at that! Sliders! Tempo! Intensity! Configurable per-channel instruments and levels! </p><div><p>Here’s the first song that ever sounded remotely passable, produced by the system.</p><p>It’s… <em>okay</em>, right? Not <em>bad</em>. That’s where the system was a year ago.</p></div><p>Here’s another song from just a few days ago: </p><div><p>Admittedly, I haven’t been working on the procgen engine for that entire year, but it hasn’t evolved much in the interim, huh?</p><p>I figured I might be able to shape the musicality of the output with simple heuristic rules and adjustments and embellishments, but - I can’t. An extremely talented musician/producer might be able to, but as we’ve established, I’m worse at finding C than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCr91EwGGxk">the salty pirates of landlocked Saskatchewan</a>. </p></div><p>Most of my clever changes would make the output sound better… some of the time. And worse, some of the time. Sometimes, rarely, the system produces something that, if you weren’t paying a terrible lot of attention, you might confuse for real music. A lot of the time it produces something bland and amusical. About as often it produces something <em>actively unpleasant</em>.</p><p>One idea I’ve had is building an underlying voting system to try to clear “bad” tunes out of the system - if my music generation system is actually powered by a thousand clips that sound pretty good under most any circumstances because all of the ones that sound bad have been downvoted out of existence, well, that’s one way of doing things.</p><p>But even at it’s best, the output isn’t… terribly good. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa2c453a-e28c-4d54-8a6f-02ea23b50ff9_534x577.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:577,&quot;width&quot;:534,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138006,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><div><p>And a big part of the problem is just that composing music is <em>hard</em>. If you take the simplest musical style that you can think of, there’s someone online explaining in painful detail that the soundtrack to Fart Chalice IV <em>actually</em> takes advantage of phrygian pentameter and post-modern phrasing to create artificial dissonance between the fourth and sixteenth notes in an alternating jazz-inspired progression.</p><p>I can just <em>barely</em> read music. I can’t deal with that! </p></div><p>There isn’t a simple set of rules for what will sound good when music is involved - people are too different from one another. There are dozens of conflicting sets of rules, and because there are so many ways to break those rules and still have music come out sounding good (or follow the rules and still have music come out sounding bad) a lot of music theory isn’t so much “helpful guidelines” as it is “endless taxonomy”, and most of that taxonomy has been compiled over the last 500 years by mostly Germans and Italians.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3797b22b-8653-4a82-8325-0fd59ade6bf0_960x960.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:125325,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>I am literally more afraid of music theory than digital signal processing.</em></p><h2>The Many Flaws of Procedural Generation</h2><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1401d2c0-9c56-43ff-acbd-d29f26cc11c0_331x500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:331,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41426,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I love this book.

This part of the project has, I think, failed, and it’s reaching the point where more effort is being met with <em>diminishing returns</em>.</p><div><p>I think I’m going to try a new plan from my list - “buy, commission, or write music, output music as midi, play music while using the midi data to silently drive effects”.</p><p>I’ll probably write some basic drum-loop first-fifteen-minutes-of-the-FruityLoops-tutorial jams to get the project off the ground, and then find someone competent to compose music if I ever feel like the project is within biting distance of actually shipping. </p></div><p>Anyways, Groovelet Music Engine, you’ve got one last chance to shine. Play yourself off! Preferably with something a little sad.</p><h2>A Goodbye From the Groovelet Music Engine</h2><p>… god dammit.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p>I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think.  The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.
</p>

<h2>Thought Provokers</h2>

<p>Ramblings that make you think about the way you design.  Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>

		<article>
			<p>From the moment I started paying attention to the tech industry, Paul Graham was there.  My first job out of college was in SoMa, around the corner from the Justin.tv offices, and his essays were just floating around in the ether, impossible to ignore.  His popularization of Lisp was a small part of why I tried Clojure, and a big part of why Clojure was successful.</p>

<p>I recognized that he had a tendency towards <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">self-aggrandizement</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">awkward flattery of his readers</a>, but at worst he seemed harmless.  As his writing became increasingly focused on startups, and I became increasingly sure I didn’t want to be a founder, he simply drifted out of view.</p>

<p>Recently, however, his writing has taken a reactionary turn which is hard to ignore.  He’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/mod.html">written</a> about the need to defend “moderates” from bullies on the “extreme left”, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1334441961147822081">asserted</a> that “the truth is to the right of the median” because “the left is culturally dominant,” and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EjGX2-bU4AAWkUX?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">justified</a> Coinbase’s policy to ban discussion of anything deemed “political” by saying that it “will push away some talent, yes, but not very talented talent.”</p>

<p>I went back to the essays I had read a decade before, to see if I had missed something.  It turned out that I had.  There was a consistent intellectual framework underpinning all his writing, from his very first essays on Lisp and language design.  In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In April 2001, six years after the release of the Java language, Paul Graham weighed in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/javacover.html">I’ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won’t be a very successful language.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He followed up with a number of observations about Java, such as the fact that it was designed by committee, infantilizes its users, and owed its initial success to an ailing corporate sponsor.  But, he wrote, this wasn’t an analysis of Java so much as introspection on his own “hacker’s radar”.  This radar was the aesthetic response of an expert programmer, drawn from epiphenomena surrounding the language and the opinions of other experts in his social circle.</p>

<p>A month later, in an essay on why languages are popular, he doubled down on the importance of his personal intuition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Programming languages are <em>for</em> hackers, and a programming language is good as a programming language (rather than, say, an exercise in denotational semantics or compiler design) if and only if hackers like it.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quality of a language can only be judged by experts (“a tiny minority, admittedly, but that tiny minority write all the good software”), and adoption by those experts will drive adoption by everyone else.  Ultimately, “a programming language probably becomes about as popular as it deserves to be.”</p>

<p>The context for both essays was that Graham was creating his own language, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>.  He wanted it to be popular, and was working out how to make that happen.</p>

<p>The first intrinsic driver of popularity he named was “brevity”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he’ll have to type.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He called back to this when discussing the importance of libraries, which can reduce any program to a single invocation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Of course the ultimate in brevity is to have the program already written for you, and merely to call it. And this brings us to what I think will be an increasingly important feature of programming languages: library functions. Perl wins because it has large libraries for manipulating strings.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears that Graham was referring to Perl’s core library functions, not the much larger set of library functions that were even then available via <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, because he placed this responsibility wholly upon the shoulders of the language designer, saying language design would become increasingly focused on “how to design great libraries.”</p>

<p>Graham named other drivers of popularity in this essay, but he returned to brevity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html">again</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">again</a> over the next year, culminating in an essay on the singular importance of brevity, now dubbed “succinctness”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html">My hypothesis is that succinctness is power, or is close enough that except in pathological examples you can treat them as identical.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drawing from studies that found “programmers seemed to generate about the same amount of code per day regardless of the language”, he declared that “the only way to get software written faster was to use a more succinct language”.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, did he mention libraries.  The next month, he explained that given a sufficiently succinct language, users could simply write their own libraries:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application. For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be likely to call an application. If a company considers itself to be in the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing libraries.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a significant departure from his earlier writings.  Only a year before, he had stated that “[i]t’s hard to design good libraries. It’s not simply a matter of writing a lot of code.”  He had emphasized that library design was a key part of language design, and even a year later he would tell us “[d]esign usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good.”</p>

<p>Now he argued that the language designer only need provide a barebones language of sufficient brevity, and all else would follow.  Library design can’t be both critically important and an incidental part of someone else’s six-month software project.  Despite this, Graham never mentioned libraries ever again.</p>

<p>A year later, he explained that Arc was trying to be a “hundred-year language”.  “It may seem presumptuous,” he wrote, but “[l]anguages evolve slowly because they’re not really technologies. Languages are notation. A program is a formal description of the problem you want a computer to solve for you.”  He asserted the most important part of the language were the “fundamental operators”, because the rest of the language “could in principle be written in terms of these fundamental operators”.</p>

<p>What, then, makes a language ready for the 22nd century?  Certainly not any concerns about performance, since “[e]ven if [computers] only end up being a paltry million times faster, that should change the ground rules for programming languages substantially.”  Not data structures, since they’re just a premature optimization of the humble list.  Not a mechanism (or even notation) for parallel computation, since a simple description of the problem will “ignore any advantages to be got from parallel computation, just as they will ignore advantages to be got from specific representations of data.”</p>

<p>A hundred-year language <em>should</em>, however, be succinct.  First “write down the program you’d like to be able to write, regardless of whether there is a compiler that can translate it or hardware that can run it.”  And of course the program you’d really like to write is the shortest one possible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">[T]he algorithm for language design becomes: look at a program and ask, is there any way to write this that’s shorter?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“If we had the hundred-year language now,” Graham wrote, “it would at least make a great pseudocode.”  Confusingly, he asserted that since it will need to perform well on its million-times-faster future processor, “presumably it could generate code efficient enough to run acceptably well on our hardware.”</p>

<p>“When you see these ideas laid out like that,” he wrote, “it’s hard not to think, why not try writing the hundred-year language now?”</p>

<hr>

<p>Four years later, in 2008, Arc was released.  It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace">Lisp-1</a> with shorter names and fewer parentheses than most other Lisps, and some reader macros to make anonymous functions easier to define.  All primitives were defined in terms of MzScheme, a different Lisp, which provided the compiler and other tooling.  It also came with a barebones web framework which used continuations, reminiscent of the Smalltalk-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)">Seaside framework</a> which had been around since 2002.</p>

<p>It was, in all, underwhelming.  There were many paths that could have led Graham to his professed goals, and he took none of them.</p>

<p>He had written that strings were premature optimization, and should be replaced by lists of characters.  If he had done so, and made the characters full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point">Unicode code points</a>, Arc could have been one of the few languages not suffering from a half-century hangover stretching all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a>.  Instead, the initial release used byte strings which only supported the ASCII character set.</p>

<p>Graham had asked “[h]ow many times have you heard hackers speak fondly of how in, say, APL, they could do amazing things with just a couple lines of code? I think anything that really smart people really love is worth paying attention to.”  But the undeniably succinct primitives and composition rules of array programming languages were nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Server-based deployment of software was a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">central theme</a> in Graham’s essays, and his continuation-based web framework was an interesting and fairly novel way to create continuity across multiple requests in a single session.  But since each link on the page was a continuation, and each continuation was stored in-memory in a single process, this created a single, memory-hungry point of failure.  For years, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> would simply display “unknown or expired link” if you waited too long to click a link.  If Arc had its own runtime, it could have supported …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h3>Docker's Second Death</h3></p><h3 id="feels-like-forever">Feels Like Forever</h3><p>Perhaps not quite forever, but the history with Docker <em>feels</em> really long in good and bad ways. I had joined Red Hat in the summer of 2015, the same summer that OpenShift 3.0 went GA. This was a remarkable event because it marked a redesign of the platform onto Kubernetes which itself had just gone to v1.0 (this is the same timeframe that GKE went GA, if you can believe it’s that old). Like many, I had no clue what Kubernetes or OpenShift were, and I definitely didn’t know much about Docker. I knew <em>of</em> containers. By fall I was neck deep in all three, and in love with the ecosystem a few months after.</p><p>The next spring was my first “real” encounter with Docker Inc. I didn’t attend Red Hat Summit 2016, but I distinctly remember that being the year that Docker really made its first outward antagonistic move against Red Hat OpenShift, at Red Hat’s own event. They were giving out the following shirt:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockerpatch.jpg" alt="docker-shirt"></p><p>To briefly summarize, this was an attack on Red Hat’s model of backporting patches to older versions of software (also known as “enterprise support”). Red Hat at that time shipped a version of Docker that was just slightly behind the latest cut, whereas Docker shipped their latest. I won’t go into the details of why that matters because there is still a debate today about whether backporting patches is better for an organization versus staying on the latest version of a thing (the latter has gotten considerably better in recent times). This was significant because up until that time, Docker was an integral part of the OpenShift narrative. We sold one with the other and the underlying assumption by most if not all of us was that Docker was just a great tech. In retrospect, this should have been expected as Docker Inc. started making its moves into the enterprise space and suddenly stopped being just great tech.</p><h3 id="it-was-inevitable">It Was Inevitable</h3><p>The early platform wars, as I call them, were primarily focused around OpenShift, Docker, and Pivotal. Pivotal had made significant inroads into enterprise organizations early on, and for good reason: the platform experience was pretty great. Couple that with Pivotal Labs and you had some pretty good mojo. Docker was the up and comer. It was the industry darling making a splash and it had the tech that everyone wanted or that everyone was already using. Kubernetes was still a bit of a question mark. I spent a lot of my time talking to organizations about the nuts and bolts of Kubernetes and why it mattered, or more accurately: why it should matter to them. The move by Docker to knock on OpenShift forced Red Hat messaging to over-index on Kubernetes and Linux over and above anything else. It worked and the industry caught up.</p><p>Docker, still in its industry darling state, responded quickly with Docker Swarm but never really caught on. Swarm was eventually overwhelmed (pun intended) by the uptake of Kubernetes across the industry, and this was when it died the first time: it lost the platform wars and became the very first commodity in the cloud native ecosystem. The second half of 2016 is really when Kubernetes edged out Swarm. This was made evident by the keynote demo at DockerCon 2017 in the following Spring when the presenters showcased Docker’s integration with Kubernetes on the big stage. Notably, that was the last “big” DockerCon that made a splash. From there on out, it was the Kubernetes/CNCF show.</p><h3 id="docker-debt">Docker Debt</h3><p>In all this time, Docker was always an integral part of Kubernetes. This was the relationship:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/dockershim.png" alt="dockershim"></p><p>And for the last 19 releases, that chain is what has been supported in Kubernetes. All that just to spin up a pod with a container in it. Docker went from necessity to technical debt. And out of all that, the community laboured until now where Docker will be deprecated in the next release of 1.20. The community has (rightfully) carried the technical debt of Docker for years to ensure the industry had what it needed for the most seamless experience given the ubiquity of the docker daemon. Here is what’s been around for a little while, but will be officially prime time in 1.20 and beyond:</p><p><img src="https://www.tariqislam.com/images/withoutdocker.png" alt="withoutdocker"></p><p>It’s a great simplification, and a return to consistency. To help visualize why this was necessary, I encourage you to view Docker as a platform abstraction on top of containers which are just an aggregate of some Linux constructs. Part of this abstraction involved an integration between the docker platform and containerd, the latter of which lives on today as arguably the most popular container runtime. Docker was never the runtime. Docker simply made containerd and other Linux constructs easy to work with so that container management would be a breeze. Instead of a dozen lines of code to create and deploy a running container, all you needed was:</p><pre><code>docker run
</code></pre><p>But like any platform, that convenience comes with a lot of bloat and technical debt. Especially over time. The removal of docker and the optimization of containerd marks a cultural shift of sorts for the cloud native landscape. None of this is meant to dismiss Docker Inc. Kubernetes today would not be where it is without Docker Inc. That’s a fact. The technologies and the competition that Docker Inc drove were some of the best things to ever happen to the industry. Now as far as turning a profitable business model out of open source technology goes, Docker Inc will likely be studied as a cautionary flash in the pan. Still, it’s important that we separate out the company’s contributions versus its business model. What’s left of the Docker platform, at this point, are its shadows within Kubernetes platforms. Though it does live on strongly within CI/CD ecosystems and, ostensibly, the inner loop of development thanks to the de facto standard Dockerfile. It is a testament to the power that Docker Inc once had, that its technology lived on far beyond the obsolescence of the company until community innovation caught up to it. With all the years of bloat baked into the platform, it’s really just a matter of time before other areas to the left of the platform shed the debt of the Docker daemon.</p><p>While it had an amazing journey and an indelible impact to the industry, practically speaking Docker is dead and dying.</p></div></div>]]>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>

  <p>– Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above maxim has guided most of my career as a software engineer and has been one of
the central <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#guiding-principles">guiding principles</a> of the <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/">community Clojure style guide</a>,
that I’ve been maintaining for the past (almost) 8 years.</p>

<p>While the style guide was well received by the Clojure community in general, and universal agreement was reached on most points in it, one aspect
remains controversial to this day - namely the style guide’s preference towards “semantic indentation” over “fixed indentation” for function/macro
arguments. Today I want to address an article that suggested that fixed indentation is preferable, as it’s simpler and it’s easier to provide tooling support for it.
That article is named <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/">Better Clojure Formatting</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, which admittedly is catchy and made me consider naming my
response to it “The Best Clojure Formatting” or “Superb Clojure Formatting”, but I’ve opted for a more modest title in the end.</p>

<h2 id="prologue-the-purpose-of-formatting">Prologue: The Purpose of Formatting</h2>

<p>Have you ever thought why formatting (layout) is important at all?
Not just in code, but in any text in general.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The answer to this question is quite simple - proper formatting
can enhance a lot the readability of any text. And here’s also the crux
of it - computers don’t really care about readability. As long as some
code is syntactically correct any compiler or interpreter would be happy
to compile or run it.</p>

<p>For us humans, however, formatting can be very helpful or extremely confusing.
As far as I’m concerned any formatting that makes some code easier to read and
comprehend is good formatting.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-semantic-formatting">Introducing Semantic Formatting</h2>

<p>Before I go into my arguments let’s briefly contrast semantic and fixed indentation with a couple of examples.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Semantic indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>something-else</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines (wide formatting)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines (narrow formatting)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>


</span><span>;;; Fixed indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; macros</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>when</span><span> </span><span>something</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>something-else</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>with-out-str</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Hello, "</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"world!"</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
  </span><span>even?</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope it’s obvious that the main difference is that “semantic indentation” differentiates between macros with body forms and regular function/macro invocations.
That makes it easy to visually tell them apart. The “fixed indentation” approach, however, advocates ignoring those differences and indenting everything the same way.</p>

<p>A different way to think about semantic indentation might be to compare it to syntax highlighting - normally different constructs in a programming language (e.g. special forms, built-in functions and user-defined functions), get highlighted
differently, to reflect their semantics and to assist the reader in comprehending what they are dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are other aspects of “semantic indentation” as well, but I’ll stick only to the most prominent/infamous parts in this article.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-formatting-vs-fixed-formatting">Semantic Formatting vs Fixed Formatting</h2>

<p>The main argument for “semantic formatting” is pretty simple - it
reflects better the semantics of your code, which results in improved
clarity/readability. Just by looking at the shape of the code you can
infer how something is supposed to behave.</p>

<p>A secondary argument might be that’s also the formatting that has been employed by
all major Lisp dialects (e.g. Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp) for a very long time.
Some might argue that following in their footsteps is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo culting</a>,
but if the premise behind their approach is still relevant today I don’t think the cargo cult theory has any merit.</p>

<p>Clojure developers have historically had a love/hate relationship with Lisp tradition, depending on their background.
That’s normal, given that Clojure was often marketed as a modern Lisp that break away from some arcane Lisp dogmas and traditions
and aligns itself with modern programming practices.
Tradition, however, doesn’t always mean bad, obsolete and irrelevant. In the case of semantic indentation, I think Clojure’s
predecessors had the right idea and nothing has fundamentally changed.</p>

<p>The main argument in favor of “fixed indentation” is tooling support - if you don’t need to format something differently, obviously creating code formatters becomes easier. There’s nothing for the formatter to parse/analyze, and there’s no need for configuration. Simplicity is generally a good thing, so this definitely sounds appealing.
While, I’m all for consistency and good tooling support, I think those are also achievable with semantic indentation in the case of Clojure (although a bit harder). Consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For many macros you can infer the right indentation just by looking for a <code>body</code> parameter:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span>
  </span><span>"Evaluates test. If logical true, evaluates body in an implicit do."</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:added</span><span> </span><span>"1.0"</span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>[</span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>'if</span><span> </span><span>test</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>cons</span><span> </span><span>'do</span><span> </span><span>body</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there will also be counter-examples that need special handling, as they used some non-conventional names, but
this simple heuristic will work quite well most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Common Lisp’s SLIME <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Semantic-indentation.html">has been using this approach</a> for a very long time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to specify the right indentation with <a href="https://docs.cider.mx/cider/indent_spec.html">metadata</a></li>
  <li>All popular Clojure editors and formatters that exist today are supporting “semantic indentation” pretty well, so clearly it’s not a big obstacle for tooling.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general I’ve always found it dangerous that a lot of the reasoning
around code style in recent years has been centered around how easy it is to enforce
certain style automatically.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>  I’ve experienced this first-hand both as
an editor of several code style guides, and as the author of a <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">fairly
popular Ruby lint/formatter tool</a>.  Yeah,
lint tools and formatters are very important and they make our lives easier, but we should
never forget we’re writing code for humans to read and (only occasionally) for machines to
execute. It’d be really sad if we lost sight of that just to pursue the ultimate degree
of consistency.</p>

<p>And there’s also the meta topic of the code we write being some artistic expression of our inner self, but we should
probably disregard this argument in any professional context. I’ll mention, though, that due to the simplicity
of Clojure/Lisp we’re (un)fortunate to have way fewer stylistic decisions to make than developers working with
languages like Ruby, Java or JavaScript.</p>

<p>Before, I wrap up I want to elaborate a bit on the reasoning behind the (infamous) semantic rules for function arguments alignment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; function call spanning two lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
        </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>;; function call spanning three lines</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>While some people would argue that the rules are random or inconsistent, I believe that’s definitely not the case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the first example, the formatting is similar to the one in every Algol-like language where the name of the function stands out and the arguments are grouped together. Of course, in most Algol-like languages people are still arguing whether to align or not align their function/method arguments. That being said, the case for aligned has always been the case for improved readability.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Ruby (aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
            <span>baz</span><span>)</span>

<span># Ruby (indented &amp; aligned arguments)</span>
<span>some_method</span><span>(</span>
  <span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span>
  <span>baz</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example is in Ruby, but it could have easily been in Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the second example some people would question what they call “the 1-space indent”. That’s not really indentation at all, but rather standard alignment of list elements. Don’t forget the <code>()</code> are not some special invocation syntax, but plain old list literals, that are normally formatted like any other collection literal:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; list literal</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>;; vector literal</span><span>
</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>
 </span><span>2</span><span>
 </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>;; set literal</span><span>
</span><span>#</span><span>{</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I find the following fixed indentation a big weird:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;;; Fixed Indentation</span><span>
</span><span>;;</span><span>
</span><span>;; list literals</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>
  </span><span>2</span><span>
  </span><span>3</span><span>
  </span><span>4</span><span>
  </span><span>5</span><span>
  </span><span>6</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Admittedly, list literals are not very common in Clojure, that’s why it’s understandable
that for many people lists are nothing but an invocation syntax.</p>

<p>“Better Clojure Formatting” argued that the semantic formatting guidelines were not consistent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rule would be easy to automate if it didn’t have a huge list of exceptions. <code>let</code>, <code>cond</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>defn</code> and many other forms simply don’t follow this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree with this assessment, as the guideline in question is strictly for forms without bodies (mostly regular function calls).
All of the cited exceptions are just regular cases of a different <a href="https://guide.clojure.style/#body-indentation">rule</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, exceptions! E.g. <code>try</code> doesn’t follow it. Also, having a mix of one- and two-space indents was driving me mad when I was trying to follow those rules manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same here. Obviously <code>try</code> is not part of the guideline in question and follows a different guideline, which is hardly an exception.</p>

<h2 id="wide-vs-narrow-formatting">Wide vs Narrow Formatting</h2>

<p>I’ve noticed that many people dislike semantic formatting, because
it’s too wide (in the sense of taking up horizontal space) for their
taste. A reader remarked he finds this wide formatting ugly, wasteful
of horizontal space, and prohibitive of descriptive (long) function
names:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (wide)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span> </span><span>even?</span><span>
                     </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to understand that the comparison of wide vs narrow formatting has nothing to do with
semantic vs fixed. I think the confusion comes mostly from the fact that the semantic formatting is
often used in its wide version, although there’s a matching narrow version for everything.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; semantic (narrow)</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>clojure.core/filter</span><span>
 </span><span>even?</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>range</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>cond</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>zero?</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>curr</span><span>
  </span><span>:else</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>recur</span><span> </span><span>nxt</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>+</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>cur…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

To do this effectively, or at least to induce useful principles for later use, you have to believe that things are the way they are for good reasons.

He proudly presents the latest in programming research for the time and explains why it’d be really silly if we aren’t using them in 40 years. To Victor’s credit he remains in character the whole time as he satirically paints the ideal world we’ll soon enter — one the audience knows doesn’t really exist.</p><p id="cbac">The future Bret showed off included direct manipulations of the output (result) instead of the code, programming via constraints/goals, spatial (visual) programming paradigms, and massively parallel programming approaches. Declarative programming, functional programming, microservice architectures and WYSIWYG editors check some of those boxes, but not nearly at the level of their potential. All that being said, there’s no argument against real progress having been made the last 40 years, just not the progress many expected.</p><p id="f16a">So now I’ll put on my analysis hat and work through why the art of programming is so hard to advance beyond its current levels.</p><p id="a3f1">Many blame the lack of advancements on developers. We built shinny thing X, but developers are too arrogant, stubborn, busy, dismissive or all of the above to adopt it. I’ve even heard people accuse developers of selfishly protecting their future job prospects by trying to stifle the adoption of new programming mediums. Heck, I’ve said this before…</p><p id="f628">^ This is just wrong. In my experience developers are very rational beings. Their job is to find the most efficient way of solving problems every single day and if you create a tool that provides that they’ll be all over it. They’ll even volunteer their time to help you build it for free. If you move forward accepting that developers are mostly rational actors and have good reasons for adopting something / not adopting something you can learn a lot to inform future design.</p><p id="33a0">So I did that. I actually sat down with people over the last 3 months and asked them why they failed to adopt a variety of tools. I overwhelmingly got rational explanations to why switching to something new was irrational.</p><h2 id="99cb">Better Hammer Tradeoff</h2><p id="8f1e">Imagine you’re building a log cabin by hand with a bad, but usable hammer. When you’re 90% of the way finished a magical genie comes and offers you a better hammer. Great! But there’s a tradeoff: If you take the new shinny hammer, you have to start the house from scratch…oh and he turns back humanity to the stone age. You can get your new hammer, but you’ll have to do without bandsaws, your pickup truck, and yes, nails.</p><p id="3e8b">What’s the rational choice? Hint, it involves the old hammer.</p><p id="7f24">That parable emerged from summarizing all the interviews I conducted and highlights the frustrations developers have had with many of the new ‘solve all your problems’ tools they’ve tried. For context these tools fit into two categories: new programming languages including some flow &amp; graph based paradigms and no-code visual builders.</p><p id="6a39">There are two areas of value to consider when choosing a programming paradigm: the developer experience of the [language, tooling, GUI] and the strength of the ecosystem (what common problems have been solved already). Many of the new paradigms, while often built on sound principles, miss out on the massive body of work that already exists is language X. How do you weight these two areas when picking your paradigm? 30–70? 90–10? 1–99? Most people I spoke with rated the ecosystem as 2–3x more important than DX.</p><p id="9ab3">Tool-builders usually only focus on DX and [assume, hope, pray] that a community comes along and builds an ecosystem. This still can happens, but it was much much more common in the 90s than it is today. There are network effects in programming and a beautiful virtuous cycle quickly emerges among the most used tools. When a user shares functionality openly it makes paradigm more capable, which attracts new users, who continue to improve that paradigm. Boom! Node module for everything.</p><p id="0b6c">When you look at the languages that have really caught on recently, they tend to share one thing in common: they tap into an existing body of work. Look at TypeScript, the most popular language released after 2000, which interoperates with Javascript. Then there’s Swift, the second most popular language released after 2000. Just imagine where Swift would be today if it hadn’t been interoperable with Objective-C and the Cocoa legacy or if TypeScript’s ecosystem was a blue ocean from day one.</p><p id="272c">There are consequences for tool makers building an entirely new base abstraction, be it visual, text based or otherwise. If you choose not to interoperate with an existing ecosystem, you or your community will need to spend years coming up from the stone age to modernity. Programming is just learning to use a bunch of stacked abstractions. Even if you have an objectively better base abstraction, one that would have clearly won out over everything else had it been introduced in 1992, people will have few incentives to adopt it if there’s no ecosystem.</p><h2 id="749d">Sunk Cost…Sensibility</h2><p id="5881">Most people complete the phrase “Sunk cost _____” with “fallacy”. The classic economics thought experiment usually involves a couple staying at a concert they hate just because they paid face value for the tickets. An enlightened economist would, as the story goes, leave as soon as they became unhappy with the concert and reclaim a few precious hours. But if you had to pay $50k, $50M or $5B to leave the concert early, you’d probably stay. When the switching costs are that high, there’s good reason to stay and the largest employers of programmers in the world have enormous switching costs. This keeps mainstream programmers anchored to the status quo.</p><p id="2c6d">This is another completely rational choice developers make when sticking to the paradigms they know. The combined costs of hiring new people, training, rewriting the code, and the opportunity cost of choosing these actions over improving your product almost always outweigh the benefits of making the change. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" rel="noopener">Joel has a classic article about code rewrites that expands on this more.</a></p><p id="ccc1">Young companies without much in the way of legacy or those with no other choice have the luxury of picking new paradigms, but few of these companies end up becoming incumbents. Those who do make it are the kingmakers. Both Facebook and Twitter were first built on technologies that were inadequate for their eventual scale (PHP and Ruby). Facebook became so attached to PHP that they enhanced the language to suit their needs with Hack and other tools. Similarly, Twitter switched over to Scala which one could argue is a key reason for Scala’s mainstream success.</p><h2 id="a2d4">Solving the Least Important Problems</h2><p id="513f">Tool makers must strike a balance between learnability and productivity. A visual programming environment like MIT’s <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> is incredibly learnable. I’ve seen 4-5 year old kids build games with it after just a few hours. The drag/drop interface and shape based constraints are really easy to learn and prevent Scratch from ever being in a broken state. This is great for kids and individuals trying to learn programming.</p><p id="bb8d">The same things that make Scratch easy to learn also make it an unproductive environment for more serious programmers. For a professional, programming with drag and drop is way slower than keying in code — that’s just a fact.</p><p id="cad2">These tradeoffs must be considered whenever building a new tool. If you build something super learnable that is not productive you’ll get a lot of praise, but little follow through. If you build something that’s too difficult to learn, but very productive you’ll turn a lot of people off. To reach mainstream programmers you need to make something that is both learnable and productive.</p><p id="5100">I think most of the stalled innovations in programming focused disproportionally on learnability. The problem is, within a few weeks of using any paradigm developers usually have built a repository of habits that keep them from making mistakes. For instance, if a new visual logic builder prides itself on preventing all syntax errors, that’s really cool, but most developers have learned to do that automatically.</p><p id="742f">Truth is, every tool you have ever used is flawed and every new tool will also be flawed. Humans subconsciously come up with ways to cope with their tools so they can keep themselves focussed on the bigger conceptual issues. That isn’t going to change anytime soon. If professionals already have habits in place to cope with things that have been made easier/more learnable by new tooling, those new tools do not have much value to them. It’s like offering a 40 year old who’s been driving manual her whole life an automatic car — yeah that’s great, but it’s not needed and she certainly won’t pay a premium for it to be included.</p><h2 id="6e7a">Things Have Been Getting Better</h2><p id="10b2">No good analysis fails to include a few words from the Advocatus Diaboli.</p><p id="e04a">Things have been getting better. The growth has just been in the ecosystems and not the paradigms themselves. We’ve been building this amazing tower of abstraction since the early days of programming that provide really useful abstractions for things like:</p><ul><li id="fb86">Charging a credit card, which has gone from a 20 person team to processor.charge()</li><li id="b32b">Configuring a massive cluster of servers is done with a short text file instead of …</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://panelbear.com/blog/boring-tech/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Note: the ideas in this post have already been covered numerous times in the past. One article that has greatly influenced my perspective over the years is <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinley's Choose Boring Technology</a>. Below I'll explore the topic from my own experience, and how I ended up using Kubernetes for a recent project.</p><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring is less surprising</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>Boring is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit the problem at hand better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Exploit vs explore</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware it can be overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it works well for me, and I have been running production workloads with it for several years already. Please do not just blindly follow my path. Use what you already know best.</p><p>Kubernetes allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable debugging issues with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. It has also been around several years, there's lots of documentation, and a huge helpful community who can help. It'd argue that there's more documentation available than for any home-grown deployment system, or even EC2/Lambda/DigitalOcean for that matter.</p><p>As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><h2>Let complexity come over time</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 6, 2020 | https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-06</span>
<p>Despite what I may have said in an earlier post, it's not <em>all</em> that nice to code directly in wat.
So I've started work on a compiler. A very thin compiler. The language should feel very similar to our, beloved, <code>wat</code>, but save us from
typing all those <code>i32.const, local.get</code>.
</p>
<p>Some points up front:
</p>
<ul><li>
the compiler targets <code>WAT</code> (not <code>WASM</code>). This means using <code>WABT::wat2wasm</code>.
</li><li>
not self hosting <span>come on people, I don't even have malloc to play with yet, let alone a buggy, poorly implemented, partial copy of common lisp.</span>
</li><li>
the compiler is written in common lisp (specifically, sbcl). <span>hereinafter CL</span>.
</li><li>
syntax checking is state-of-the-art and errors are output in a readable format (i.e. you will get a cryptic <code>sbcl</code> debug trace if you make the
slightest mistake).
</li><li>
why <strong>sugar</strong>? It was either that or <code>watson, watsup, watsamatta, watulookin</code>. <span>Also cos it's just syntactical sugar, get it?</span>
</li><li>
internet searches are to be done using <code>sugarlang</code> <span>or sugarland if you prefer</span>.
</li><li>
there is no manual; not even mul/div or all the relation operators (e.g. &lt;=) are written yet!
</li><li>
the compiler output is not a standalone executable but a <code>wasm</code> file. The <em>best</em> standalone wasm runtime I've found so far is <code>wasm-interp</code>.
Please don't say node.js. You can say <code>v8</code>, maybe.
</li></ul>
<blockquote><strong>node.js/npm</strong><br>That feeling when ...<br>People say <em>Minimalist System</em><br>Then say "just use npm install ..."<br></blockquote><h2> sugar example</h2>
<p>Here is the <code>malloc.wat</code> example from the previous blog post on webasm re-written in <code>sugar</code>.
It's quite a bit more concise and convenient than the original raw <code>wat</code> (see below).
</p>
<p>(previous post on <code>wat</code>
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html">/blog/2020-12-03-webasm-forth-with-lisp-syntax.html</a>
)
</p>
<pre>; malloc.sugar - sugar example code
(memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
(import "console" "log" (func js_log (i i32)))
(global memend i32 #x1000)
(global sbrk (mut i32) 0)
; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
(defun (export "malloc") (len i32) :result i32
  (locals (i32 (newbrk (+ sbrk len)) (mem sbrk)))
  (if (&gt;= newbrk memend) (return 0))
  (set sbrk newbrk)
  mem)
; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
(defun (export dump_range) (start i32 len i32)
  (locals (i32 i (end (+ start len))))
  (for (i start end)
    (js_log (get.u8* i))))
</pre>
<p>And this is what you would have written if you were coding directly in <code>wat</code>.
</p>
<pre>(module
  (memory (import "js" "mem") 10)
  (import "console" "log" (func $js_log (param $i i32)))
  (global $memend i32  (i32.const 4096))
  (global $sbrk (mut i32)  (i32.const 0))
  ;; ----- allocate some memory in wasm-space
  (func (export "malloc") (param $len i32) (result i32)
    (local $newbrk i32)
    (local $mem i32)
    (local.set $newbrk (i32.add (global.get $sbrk) (local.get $len)))
    (if (i32.ge_u (local.get $newbrk) (global.get $memend))
      (return (i32.const 0)))
    (local.set $mem (global.get $sbrk))
    (global.set $sbrk (local.get $newbrk))
    (local.get $mem))
  ;; ----- write bytes in wasm-space memory using js callback
  (func (export "dump_range") (param $start i32) (param $len i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (local $end i32)
    (local.set $end (i32.add (local.get $start) (local.get $len)))
    (local.set $i (local.get $start))
    (block $break2 (loop $head1
      (br_if $break2 (i32.eq (local.get $i)  (local.get $end)))
      (call $js_log (i32.load8_u (local.get $i)))
      (local.set $i (i32.add  (i32.const 1) (local.get $i)))
      (br $head1)))))
</pre>
<h2> using sugar</h2>
<p>Write a <code>your-source.sugar</code> source file in your favorite text editor. Then run <code>sugar</code> on it to produce <code>your-source.wat</code>
</p>
<p>This is how I use sugar (with a makefile for calling sugar, then wat2wasm):
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.mk">/src/sugar.mk</a>
</p>
<pre>$ mk malloc.wasm
./sugar malloc.sugar &gt;malloc.wat
summary: globals:2 functions:3 macros:2
wat2wasm malloc.wat
</pre>
<p>(see below for installing common lisp)
</p>
<h2> compiler</h2>
<p>The compiler is very small and may be interesting to read, for that reason.
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar">/src/sugar</a>
</p>
<p>It includes a macro system, which I have used to implement <code>inc</code> and <code>for</code> but it's not yet available for use from sugar
itself. <span>Also the full CL defmacro/destructuring-bind lambda list syntax is non trivial to replicate; not to mention backquote.</span>
</p>
<h3> compiler structure</h3>
<p>Here is the overall compiler structure
</p>
<pre>loop:
  read a form [from source file]
  (compile form) =&gt; stdout
compile form:
  integer =&gt; (i32.const int)
  symbol =&gt; (local/global.get varname) [check in environment/scope]
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    if (is-macro? form)
      (compile (expand-macro form))
    else:
      is-special? form =&gt; (compile-special form) [defun/import/export/global/set...]
      is-function? =&gt;
        for all args (compile arg)
        call func with args
      otherwise =&gt; error undefined function
</pre>
<h3> common lisp?</h3>
<p>Too many brackets?
</p><blockquote>Rule 1: There are no brackets, only indentation.<br>Rule 0: We suffer the brackets cos it gives us defmacro and that's worth a lot of suffering.<br></blockquote><p>Did you ever generate code? Did you think that was cool? You'll love common lisp. Try it for 2 weeks.
Money back guarantee if not satisfied.
</p>
<h3> value-if</h3>
<p>Lisp has value-IF i.e. you can use IF anywhere you use a value. That's like C's ternary but more powerful.
At first I thought WAT doesn't have it, but (if) has an optional
<code>(result type)</code> clause, like (func) so that it's branches
can return (type matched) values. So you can do clever things like this:
<span>note the (result i32) clause between if and condition.</span></p>
<pre>(set x
  (if (result i32) (&gt;= z limit)
    (comp-true-value y)
    (comp-false-value s 14 q)))
</pre>
<p><code>wat (select)</code> is like the C ternary operator although it can have blocks/statement sequences inside.</p><p>select v if: select has all 3 clauses always evaluated while (if) has only the conditional and the chosen branch evaluated. The other
(if) branch is not evaluated.
</p>
<h2> future directions</h2>
<h3> user accessible macros (defmacro)</h3>
<p>Implement (defmacro ...) for sugar.
</p>
<h3> shortcut and/or</h3>
<p>At the moment I only have the bitwise and/or operators '&amp;' and 'bor' and next on the list is having shortcutting logical <code>and/or</code> operators
like CL.
</p>
<p>Ideally I'd like to have lisp-style <code>and/or</code> where the expression value is
returned rather than just 0 or 1. Also standalone <code>and/or</code> so we can have things like
</p>
<pre>(and (file-existsp fname) (process-file fname))
(or (setup-completep) (error setup-failed))
</pre>
<span>Shortcut <code>and/or</code> actually compile to nested (if) expressions.</span><h3> missing operators/functions</h3>
<p>A whole slew of function counterparts for other types (i64,f32,f64) are missing. The compiler cannot type-infer which one (see below)
so these would have explicit names like <code>+f64, set.f64</code> etc.
</p>
<p>There are many other relops missing etc. They are fairly trivial to add.
</p>
<h3> arrays</h3>
<p>Currently I'm using pointer <code>get*/set*</code> but I'd like to have <code>aref</code> and implicit index to pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<h3> loops</h3>
<p>Some more loops. <code>while repeat</code> etc. The underlying <code>block, loop, br_if, br</code> are exposed so writing loops is possible.
It would only be the case of adding some more macros to enable:
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
</pre>
<p>Also <code>continue, break</code> would be nice.
</p>
<h3> structures / defstruct</h3>
<p>Some kind of struct might be nice to have. Even if all the fields had to be i32 initially i.e. just a vector with named,
instead of numbered, fields.
</p>
<h3> better syntax/semantic checking</h3>
<p>Even the current error messages drop you into the SBCL debugger, which can be a scary place - [<code>ctrl-d</code>] to exit.
</p>
<h3> type tracing</h3>
<p>Knowing the types of values would allow the compiler to check signatures of calls of user functions and builtins.
It would also allow me to infer the correct type for <code>set</code> rather than requiring <code>set.f32</code> etc.
</p>
<h3> LET</h3>
<p>Locals <em>must</em> be defined at the start of a function. This means implementing LET (scoped blocks with local variables) is not trivial.
The current, single-pass, compiler would need to become far more complex to first decide how many locals are required in a function,
then allocate them up-front and possibly rename them if there are clashes.
</p>
<h3> self hosting</h3>
<p>The <em>holy grail</em> of compiler writers is that they rewrite their compiler in their new language. Common Lisp is <em>so far</em> above
the level of <code>wat</code> that this would be a large undertaking. First I'd need to write malloc...

<h2> installing common lisp</h2>
<p>Setting up sugar/common lisp may be trivial or hard depending on how familiar with common lisp you are :)
</p>
<p>Installing common lisp (I use SBCL) is outside the scope of this post. (Tell me it's harder than npm ...)

<p>I refer you to [Zach Beane's]

</p>
<p>SBCL might even be in your package manager:
</p>
<pre>$ pacman -Ss sbcl
</pre>
<p><code>sugar</code> is run as a unix script. I've made a custom sbcl core since I prefer <code>iterate</code> over <code>loop</code>.
Here is a very brief explanation of how to make such a core, starting with <em>plain, vanilla</em> sbcl.
</p>
<pre>$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload '#:iterate)
* (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "sbcl-iterate")
$ sudo mv sbcl-iterate /usr/share/sbcl/sbcl-iterate

<h2> mistakes</h2>
<p>[2020-12-07] My original compiler structure had a macro expansion bug. I was misled since I was in a block where I had just checked that
(form) was a consp/list and I assumed this remained true inside that block.
However, I missed the fact that I am modifying the form inside the block, with (expand-macro).
It's possible (expand-macro) returns a non-list e.g. a symbol. Then my list assumptions break.
</p>
<pre>compile form:
  ...
  list/s-expr/cons =&gt;
    while: (is-macro? form)
      form := (expand-macro form) &lt;---- bug: this can change form into a non-list
    is-special? form =&gt; ...
    is-function? =&gt; ...
</pre>
<p>First I fixed this with an extra list check in is-macro and also in the is-special/is-function parts, and a recursive call to compile
for non-list forms.
</p>
<p>I later thought if I had used a functional approach and avoided the mutation, I would not have made this mistake. My visual hint
that I was dealing with a list would have remained true. It turns out the functional solution is even more elegant than the original
and doesn't have the bug (+1 to functional purists).
</p>
<p>The functional solution, doesn't loop, it recurses on compile. Then compile gets the chance to decide again
what type of form expand-macro returned (nested macros …</p></div>

<p>Suppose you double-click on a file on your computer. You're doing this so you can open the file and work with it. But does your operating system know what that means? How does it know <em>what</em> to open the file <em>in</em>? Let's look at some solutions that have been proposed over the years to solving this issue.</p>
<p>(fun fact: this originally started as a touchup of <a href="https://invisibleup.com/articles/2/">one of my oldest articles</a> before just kinda becoming this whole <em>thing</em>, so expect a bit of retreading.)</p>
<h2>Nothing</h2>
<p><img alt="IBM 709 in use" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/IBM709.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: Early mainframes such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, etc.</p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://www.computer-history.info/Page4.dir/pages/IBM.704.dir/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>)</p>
<p>What's a "file", anyways? It's a sequence of bytes on a disk, possibly floppy. Or a tape. (Cassette or paper, your choice.) Or on stacks of cards with holes in them. Or toggled in by hand on a front panel.</p>
<p>File types weren't relevant because <em>files</em> weren't really a thing. In the mainframe era, you typically 
1. loaded a program on to your computer from punch cards or a tape
2. fed input into that program either from a teletype terminal or from a different tape/card deck
3. received output from the teletype, a line printer, or yet another tape/card deck</p>
<p>Computers weren't complicated enough where there was any confusion as to what a file on a certain medium <em>was</em>, simply because there was so little to work with. If you had a stack of punchcards, that was your "file". Hope you labeled the box you put it in!</p>
<p>Tapes are more interesting, because they hold substantially more data. (A whopping 5.76 megabytes, stored on 3/4 of a kilometer of magentic tape. How exciting!) That said, storing more than one file on a tape was a strange task. Operating systems weren't really a <em>thing</em> yet. The best that existed were programming languages such as FORTRAN or COBOL that had statements for hardware tasks such as reading from or writing to a tape or punch card. For example, <a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102649787.05.01.acc.pdf">here's the manual for FORTRAN for the IBM 704.</a> We have several commands such as <code>READ</code> (from the punch card reader), <code>READ TAPE</code>, <code>PUNCH</code> (new cards), <code>PRINT</code> (to the printer), etc.</p>
<p>On the IBM tape units of the time (ex: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_727">IBM 727</a>), tapes were separated into <em>files</em> and <em>records</em>. In FORTRAN, records were created on every <code>WRITE TAPE</code> command, and could be read with <code>READ TAPE</code> later. Records could be overwritten by using the <code>BACKSPACE</code> statement and then writing again. Files were collections of records, and could be created with an <code>END FILE</code> command.</p>
<p>As an aside, later programming languages such as C still share their heritage from this era. This is why we draw text to the screen with <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/"><code>printf</code></a> which long ago would have literally printed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">teletype terminal</a>, why we read files using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/rewind/"><code>rewind</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fseek/"><code>fseek</code></a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/"><code>fread</code></a>, and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/"><code>fwrite</code></a> as if we were on a tape drive still. Even <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a>, the encoding most commonly used for the basic Latin alphabet, has code points for file, group, record, and unit separators. (This may also be related to block terminals, something that will be discussed in a future article.)</p>
<p>As mainframes moved onto more advanced batch processing and later interactive time-share operating systems like UNIX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors">OS/360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System">ITS</a>, etc., they gained more sophisticated methods of dealing with files than raw tape drive access. But then came the microcomputers.</p>
<h2>Type Codes</h2>
<p><img alt="Apple DOS file listing" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/appledos.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS">Apple DOS for Apple II</a> (1978-1980), <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp28c.htm">HP-28</a> and <a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp48s.htm">HP-48</a> series, etc.</p>
<p>We have floppy disks now. They can store a lot of files, rename them, delete them, etc. without too much issue. There's this neat computer called the Apple II that just came out. It uses these new-fangled disks, so it needs to figure out how to store files on it.</p>
<p>The way that Apple DOS (the Apple II's disk operating system for most of it's life) stored files is somewhat interesting. Each file has a name (up to 30 characters) and also a <em>type code</em>. 8 of them were defined but only 4 of them mattered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I (Integer BASIC program)</li>
<li>A (Applesoft BASIC program)</li>
<li>B (Binary files; either assembled programs or data)</li>
<li>T (ASCII text files)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple DOS had some specific commands that interacted with these types. For instance, the <code>RUN</code> command worked on both Interger BASIC and Applesoft BASIC programs, and chose which one to use. <code>BRUN</code>, <em>binary run</em>, only worked on binary files. <code>OPEN</code>, <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>CLOSE</code> all worked only on ASCII text files.</p>
<p><strong>The types more served as a way to help the operating system more so than you.</strong> This is especially evident in the late 80's and early 90's HP calculators such as the HP-28c and the HP-48GX. These calculators didn't have disks, but they did have persistent memory that could store objects into folders much like a computer.</p>
<p>These calculators used Reverse Polish Notation. Essentially, you do math by placing objects on the stack and then executing commands, which take things from the stack and put a new thing on. An <em>object</em> in RPN is something you placed on the stack. The HP-48's Advanced User's Reference Manual lists 32 distinct types, including real numbers, complex numbers, character strings, arrays, lists, variable names, executable programs, graphics objects, directories, etc. A <em>command</em> could be, say, <code>ADD</code> or some fancy plotting calculus stuff. Whatever they were, they needed to know what types they were dealing with so that they could either reject the input or properly work with it.</p>
<p>Like the Apple II, just having an integer for a type is perfectly okay because the types don't serve the user. They're just there so the operating system knows what a given chunk of bytes on the stack <em>is</em>. There are a few reserved spots for custom types, but for the most parts new types aren't expected to ever be added, nor should they be.</p>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p><img alt="CP/M disk listing as seen on an Amstrad CPC" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/cpm.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Used in</strong>: AMSDOS (Amstrad CPC), CP/M, MS-DOS, etc.</p>
<p>Microcomputers really started to gain in popularity with the likes of the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC and the Commodore 64 among others. These were fairly cheap and simple computers. When first launched, these came with nothing but cassette tape inputs, as disks were too expensive.</p>
<p>On these computers, you'd attach a cassette player using a standard AUX cord (although some, like the CPC, had a cassette player built in), and the computer would instruct you when to start and stop the tape. These cassette players usually came with a little counter that rolled up as the tape progressed, to help you tell where the tape was. When you insert a tape, you reset the counter to zero. When you want to <em>make</em> a file, you'd write down what the counter read, then save the file. To <em>load a specific file</em>, you'd seek the tape until you're at the location you've written down, then start reading.</p>
<p>More advanced computers such as the Amstrad CPC instead saved <a href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/AMSDOS_Header">a header</a> with each file containing, among other things, a file name and extension. If asked for a specific file it could just read the tape until it found it. Later these computers gained disk drives, and any ad-hoc tape fiddling was replaced with a proper file system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table">FAT</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a> that stored <em>where</em> a file was on a given disk and <em>what is was called</em>.</p>
<p>File codes are limited. It is nigh-on impossible to add more ones. What you have is what you got. So... what if we just made the codes out of letters? A couple of them? And they could be anything. Then programmers could come up with whatever file extensions they want and that's okay.</p>
<p>Suppose, in MS-DOS, you have a file named <code>REPORT.TXT</code>. <code>REPORT</code> is the file name, <code>TXT</code> is the extension. <strong>File extensions give an easy, consistent indicator of what a file contains.</strong> A <code>TXT</code> file contains text, a <code>BMP</code> file is a bitmap, etc. </p>
<p>Some file extensions, like <code>EXE</code>, <code>BAT</code>, <code>SYS</code> and <code>COM</code> had special meaning much in the same way that the Apple DOS codes had special meanings, but other than that they're just there to help the user. <strong>The user had to manually choose which program to use.</strong> This allowed for the user to choose what view or editor to use depending on what would be the most helpful. Unfortunately, there were no default programs. If the user didn't know which program, say, a <code>VIZ</code> file is for, they're out of luck. Is it a visualization? Some manga thing? The digital manifestation of a cute internet ghost who's staying up way too late geeking out about old computers? <em>The world may never know...</em></p>
<h3>Creator Codes</h3>
<p><strong>Used in:</strong> Classic Mac OS</p>
<p><img alt="File properties dialog on Classic Mac OS" src="https://invisibleup.com/articles/34/macinfo.gif"></p>
<p>Let's hop on over to the Macintosh for a quick second. It was a newfangled thing in 1984, and it had the opportunity to reinvent the wheel and break compatibility with CP/M and mainframe traditions. And so it did.</p>
<p>The original 128K Macintosh used 400K floppy disks, a not-completely-terrible amount of space for the time. It used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System">MFS</a>, which didn't support directories but <em>did</em> support files. It was also completely graphically driven. The Finder was supposed to be the primary way of interacting with files, and the <code>File &gt; Open</code> command could launch the program that made the file. How'd it do that?</p>
<p><strong>Instead of file extensions, the Macintosh used type and creator codes</strong>. These were 4-byte identifiers, much like file extensions, but there were two of them each with a different meaning. The type code was mean to represent the format the data was stored in, used to filter files in the Finder's "Open" dialog. The creator code was meant to indicate the application that created the file, and used by the Finder to choose which specific application to launch. Now, these weren't normally visible to the user. They just saw the file name and a icon for that type.</p>
<p>To do that, the system kept a database of codes and their associated icons and programs. When ran for the first time or moved from disk to disk, <strong>the Finder would read the program data and register in a database what creator codes and file types it supported.</strong> The Finder would then save this information on the disk containing the application. Later, <strong>when the user opened a file, the OS would check its type and creator code against its stored list to determine which application to use.</strong> This worked pretty well.</p>

<p><strong>Monopoly Technology Platforms are Colonizing Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Larry Kuehn</strong></p>
<p>The exposés of abuse by social media corporations like Google and Facebook have finally brought attention to the dangers of monopolies over our communications. The way these monopolies have been colonizing public education has, however, gone almost unnoticed. This is rampant privatization sneaking in as essential to “21<sup>st</sup> Century learning.”</p>
<p>The top five global capital corporations are technology platforms—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Platforms are a host for a variety of services and uses. All of the big five platform corporations have become too large in a short period of time to have any significant competition outside of this group. They compete against one another, adding services to secure their monopoly by offering users everything they do online.</p>
<p>If a new service is developed that seems to be gaining users, or that competes with an element of their platform, it is purchased and integrated into the platform—avoiding new competitors. Alternatively, they use their massive resources to develop a comparable app and push the potential competitor aside.</p>
<p>Snicek, in <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862"><em>Platform Capitalism</em></a>, points out that the development of these monopolies “introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to a post-capitalist future.” Building public cooperative platforms becomes an impossible dream.</p>
<p>No surprise—these platforms have moved to colonize education. Public education represents a big chunk of potential revenue. Just as importantly, schools are where one can find most of the future potential consumers and users of the platform services.</p>
<p>Colonization is a process where a significant force moves into an area and dominates. It takes over not only the production and resources, but imposes—often by stealth and power—the processes and approaches and even values of the social and cultural environment. And, dominate is what the monopoly platforms are on track to do in public education.</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png" alt="" width="262" height="131" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-400x200.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education-768x384.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/G-Suite-For-Education.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px">The most successful colonizer has been Google. A recent report indicates that Google’s <em>G-Suite for Education</em> is being used by half the teachers and students in the U.S. Canada is fast approaching the same level of use. It includes a range of free software tools that can be used by students and teachers—word processing, presentations, spread sheets and the like. G-Suite incorporates “Classroom,” an integrated learning management system that keeps track of grades, attendance and more. And, of course, YouTube is linked to student use.</p>
<p>New elements are added frequently. “Google Sites” is promoted for student e-portfolios, because “every student should publish for the world.” Google acquired Workbench, integrated with Google Classroom to give “lessons connected to a variety of ‘maker’ activities focused on STEM.” It is part of Google’s plan to “help schools and educators address their universal needs around education content.”</p>
<p>Google, rather than democratic public institutions, therefore shapes what is on offer. Google’s position as colonizer is strengthened by the hardware increasingly used in schools—the Google Chromebook. <img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png" alt="" width="346" height="192" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-400x222.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000-768x425.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/CB_canada.max-1000x1000.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px">It is less expensive than other computers because much of what it needs to operate is supplied by Google in the cloud—operating software, applications and memory. No need to build those into the computer.&nbsp; According to market reports, Chromebooks make up the majority of all computers sold to schools in the U.S. and are marketed globally.</p>
<p>However, one must have a gmail account to use these Google tools—so if a parent wants to protect the privacy of their child and refuses a gmail account that kid is left out while the rest of the class works away on their Chromebook and other Google tools. (See <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4497822/GAFE-Information-Letter-and-Consent-Form-page2.pdf">here</a> the kind of consent form parents are asked to sign, giving Google access to acquire and store student information outside of Canada.)</p>
<p><img src="http://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png" alt="" width="657" height="115" srcset="https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-400x70.png 400w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-768x135.png 768w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM-1024x180.png 1024w, https://instituteforpubliceducation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2018-12-31-at-4.20.52-PM.png 1238w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px"></p>
<p>Google has even taken up teaching “internet safety,” with a program aimed at reaching 5 million students. Its core is a game for students in Grades three to six to teach them to avoid “schemers, hackers and other bad actors.” However, as critics point out, it doesn’t talk about privacy concerns when users’ personal information and actions are tracked online. Google conveniently ignores its role as a “bad actor.”</p>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474904116654917">Swedish study </a>of Google’s strategy concluded that “By making an implicit demarcation between two concepts (your) ‘data’ and (collected) ‘information’ Google can disguise the presence of a business model for online marketing and, at the same time, simulate the practices and ethics of a free public service institution.”</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://2017trends.hackeducation.com/data.html">The Weaponization of Education Data</a>,” Audrey Watters points out “the risk isn’t only hacking.&nbsp; It’s amassing data in the first place. It’s profiling. It’s tracking. It’s surveilling.”</p>
<p>Google isn’t alone in the business of colonizing education and student data—just the most successful so far. One competitor is Microsoft 365 Education, with a promise of “empowering every student on the planet to achieve more” and that it will “unlock limitless learning.”</p>
<p>It’s not an accident that it is “Microsoft 365” that is being pushed. It offers a cloud-based software and cloud storage for your work. It is the new business model for Microsoft: they don’t sell you software, you rent it—and you keep paying for it. And your work isn’t saved on your own computer, so you have to keep up your subscription. Like Google, they are hoping that students will keep using their tools when they finish being students.</p>
<p>Microsoft is imitating much of what Google offers, but by charging for the service rather than trading it for data. It offers apps, educator training and STEM lessons “to enrich science, technology, engineering and math classes.” They offer “budget friendly” Windows 10 devices with licences for Microsoft 365 Education.</p>
<p>The other major tech corporations have programs as well. Apple, for example, was the first into education with the Apple IIe and the “Apple Classroom of Tomorrow” way back in the 1980s. More recently it depended on the ease of use of the iPad, despite its cost, to sell classroom sets along with Pearson curriculum in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/los-angeles-edtech/">ill-fated project with Los Angeles schools</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists are hoping to find the magic app that will make a fortune. The potential market is indicated by expenditure of hundreds of millions each year on developing new products. The “winners” are likely to be bought up by one of the major corporations—or find their product idea taken by the monopolies.</p>
<p>Not enough attention is paid by education authorities or researchers to the shaping and distortion of education that is possible—even likely—by this colonization of education by technology monopolies.</p>

<p>In Segmentâ€™s early days, we hit countless problems as a founding team. And at the time, I thought those problems were unique to our own special snowflake of a founding journey. I chalked it up to us being new grads and first-time founders.</p><p>But as I've worked with more and more startups, I've realized just how wrong I was.</p><p>Over the past five years, I've made about 25 different seed-stage investments. In doing so, it's taught me a <em>LOT</em> about the common errors that startup founders make. Even across different industries and levels of experience, I see founders hitting the exact same set of problems we encountered in the early days of Segment!</p><p>This post shares a handful of the top lessons that benefit todayâ€™s early stage founders. Itâ€™s a list of the things I wish weâ€™d figured out earlier at Segment. [1]</p><p>This sounds incredibly boring... but the #1 mistake I see startups making is that they donâ€™t set goals. If you take one thing from this post, it's that you should set goals for where you want to be.</p><p>For the longest time at Segment, we didn't have goals. We moved ahead in various (often random) directions, and we would launch features consistently... but we never really set goals at all.</p><p>As we grew the company, we started to lose momentum. Teams were spending time on a bunch of stuff that frankly just didn't really matter to the overall business.</p><p>It wasn't until we hired our VP Eng, Tido, that we finally started setting focused and audacious product goals. Just by verbalizing where we wanted to go and then grading our results, our velocity improved by an order of magnitude.</p><p>I don't care if you call them OKRs, sprints, or something else entirely. Just set a deadline when you want to have something done and a metric you want to move or some other concrete result.</p><p>When early stage founders do attempt to set goals, I often see them agonize over what specific goals to choose. In practice, a "pretty good goal" is way better than "no goals at all". Perfect is the enemy of good.</p><p>If you don't yet have product-market fit, your goal should probably be getting your first 3-5 customers using the product. If you've hit the level where you now have dozens of users, your goal should be growing by an order of magnitude. It's better to get in the habit of setting and driving towards goals rather than being too worried about their exact semantics. Worst case, you just pick a better goal later.</p><p>A great set of goals answers the question: <em><strong>"what would have to be true in order for us to feel good about our progress at the end of the month?"</strong></em><em> [2]</em></p><p>If each teammate can independently answer "what are our goals for the month?" in the same way, you'll know you've succeeded. If youâ€™re looking for prior art, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. </p><p>If you strictly focus on making things true by a certain date, you are bound to make at least some progress towards your end result. </p><p>At the end of the day, every billion-dollar startup is really just the sum of many small deltas.</p><p>Let's get one thing straight: your investors won't know everything. But investors won't know <em>anything</em> if you don't keep them updated on how things are going.</p><p>For the longest time, we were fearful of our Segment investors, to the point that we wouldn't bother sending them emails unless they asked about us. I can say now with confidence that this was 100% the wrong approach.</p><p>We worried that investors would think that we were screwing up (true) and failing (true as well!). And while that might be the case, a founder-friendly investor won't think that way. Investors, especially angels, invested because they believe in <em>you</em>. If I didn't think a team would go somewhere, I wouldn't put money in.</p><p>With each investor, <strong>include the goals you're working towards, as well as the asks for them</strong>. I think monthly is about the right cadence for this in the early days, moving to quarterly around Series A/B time when you start partnering more with a few board members.</p><p>Simply writing the updates should clarify your own thinking tremendously. If it takes you more than 1-2h to put together an update on the most important things happening at the company, it's probably a sign that you should be doing more thinking about the big picture.</p><p>When asking for help, the things that our investors have been able to help us with evolved quite a bit over time. But here's a good rule of thumb for what to ask for:</p><ul><li><p><u>Seed/Pre-seed</u>: user-testing, intros to beta users, hiring</p></li><li><p><u>Series A</u>: hiring, early customers, go-to-market</p></li><li><p><u>Series B/C+</u>: comparables at other companies, senior/exec hires, specific expertise around things like management, infrastructure, systems, etc.</p></li></ul><p>Not all investors will be able to help with everything. But at the very least, sending them information will help you be top of mind. I've lost track of how many times a moment of serendipity where I'm catching up with an old friend has led to a meaningful conversation for a company I've invested in.</p><p>As an extra bonus, the strongest startups send these updates to everyone on their team. It's amazing how much putting the goals in writing helps everyone stay on the same page about what's most important.</p><p>One other note here: take pictures. I now wish we had far more pictures of Segment at every stage of the company. They help turn investor updates into cherished memories.</p><p>Okay, this lesson is taken directly from the YC playbook. And YET, I see so many founders (including YC founders) fail to launch their product. </p><p>If no one notices your launch... just ignore it and then launch again. If you're doing things right, you'll never run out of stuff to launch! [3]</p><p>Why is launching so important? Let me share a personal story...</p><p>We spent about 1.5 years building different iterations of analytics tools. For every iteration, we had a waitlist that users could sign up to use. We personally reached out to the users who we thought were the best fits, and then tried to set up time to use the product. </p><p>The result? Nobody cared. We had no users. We never launched. </p><p>When we finally launched Segment in it's current incarnation, we threw out that approach entirely. We put up a self-service flow, and let anyone who wanted to sign up for it.</p><p>That's when something strange happened... we attracted an entirely new set of developers who just were crawling out of the woodwork and excited to use the new product we'd built. They were coming from companies far outside of SV that we'd never heard of.</p><p>It floored me.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned: the people you happen to be talking to now are probably not the people who have the biggest problem in your space. Do everything you can to reach the folks with the biggest problem, and then, reduce any barriers they might encounter.</strong></p><p>I expect a bunch of you reading this post to ignore this advice, just like we did in the early days. It takes a certain confidence to launch something you've built and put it out there for the world to see. Ultimately though, the rewards are worth it. You'll see users coming from communities you've never even heard of.</p><p>Let me tell you a tale of two startups.</p><p><strong>Startup A</strong> is constantly putting up interesting content on their blog. Their founders are sharing product launches, engineering posts, and creatively brainstorming about what it takes to solve problems in their market.</p><p><strong>Startup B</strong> is operating in stealth. You can't find much about them online, but one of the founders reached out with a nice personalized email mentioning their funding by a top-tier VC. </p><p>Suppose you're looking for a job... do you pick Startup A or Startup B? In my experience, A almost always wins. Momentum is a compounding force.</p><p><strong>Unless you are working in a space that heavily depends on IP, you should probably be publishing more content about what you are doing.</strong> This could be open source, it could be a weekly newsletter, it could be a changelog. [4]</p><p>Whatever it is, it's going to help you both hire <em>and</em> attract customers. So much of the internet is merely about consuming, that just by putting ideas out there, youâ€™ll have a leg up on the competition.</p><p>In the early days of Segment, our <a href="https://segment.com/blog/show-hn-to-series-d/">user acquisition was powered by open source projects and blog posts</a>. But I've seen founders have success with Twitter, Substacks, Podcasts and a variety of different channels.</p><p>If you're looking for inspiration, the <a href="https://railway.app/changelog">Railway</a> and <a href="https://linear.app/changelog">Linear</a> changelogs are epic examples. Companies like <a href="https://baremetrics.com/blog/i-sold-baremetrics">Baremetrics</a> and <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/shareholder-update-q2-2020-and-july/">Buffer</a> differentiated themselves by just being open and honest. <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/globe">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">Figma's blogs</a> not only share what they build, but how they built it.</p><p>There are three big inputs that all startups need to continue growing</p><ol><li><p>product capabilities</p></li><li><p>customers and users</p></li><li><p>hiring</p></li></ol><p>I've put them in roughly the order that most teams encounter them. </p><p>Startups begin with a small product that has a modicum of utility. It starts attracting a handful of customers organically. And as more and more customers start using the product, the founders realize that they need extra help to stay on top of all of those requests.</p><p>Remember though, the real goal here is #2. Itâ€™s not the size of your team, itâ€™s the value youâ€™re able to provide to the world. [5]</p><p>I see hiring a big team before you have product-market fit as a red flag. If the company doesn't yet have a set direction, it's going to be harder to pivot with 10 people than it is with 3.</p><p>But, I've worked with startups who have traction and runway... and just seem to be spinning their wheels under load from existing customers.</p><p>I get it. Hiring isn't the most fun, especially for an introvert. It's a lot of interviewing and feeling like there's a lot of rejection. Rejecting people sucks. Losing candidates sucks. For many of our roles at Segment, we've had to talk with 50-100 different people to make an eventual hire.</p><p><strong>If you have 24 months of runway, and a clear list of things youâ€™d do if you had more copies of yourself: you probably aren't spending time to hire the people you need.</strong></p><p>At Segment, my co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/ivolo">Ilya</a> fulfilled this role. It was back in 2014, we were 12 people at the time, had raised a $10m Series A, and had $1m in revenue.</p><p>Thing…</p></div></div>
