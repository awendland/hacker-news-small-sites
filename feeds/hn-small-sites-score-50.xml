September 25, 2020 | https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/on-not-choosing-wordpress/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="0"> <div>  <div class="page"> <div id="main-content" role="main">  <p> <span>Updates</span> <span>CMS</span> </p>  <hr> <p>The W3C redesign project is an incredibly exciting one for us at Studio 24, it’s an honour to be working with an organisation we have looked up to for our whole career. But it’s also challenging, with many aspects coming under more scrutiny than we’re normally used to. It’s also made harder in this time of pandemic, with increased anxiety and challenges working effectively during this “new normal” we’re all living in.</p> <p>We’re happy to rise to this challenge. Yesterday a well written article was published by WordPress Tavern on <a href="https://wptavern.com/w3c-drops-wordpress-from-consideration-for-redesign-narrows-cms-shortlist-to-statamic-and-craft">W3C dropping WordPress from consideration</a> which I’d like to respond to.</p> <h2 id="in-context-of-the-project"> <a href="#in-context-of-the-project"></a> In context of the project </h2> <p>We’ve tackled a huge variety of work so far from initial Discovery, User Research, Information Architecture, Content Design and UX Design that has helped move the project forward.</p> <p>The CMS platform decision is just part of this and for the end website is one of the less visible aspects. As you can read from <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/cms-selection-report/">Marie’s report on the work we did to choose Craft CMS</a> you can see the steps we went through to help shortlist and choose a CMS.</p> <p>For us, and the requirements from W3C, the delivery of accessible HTML/CSS pages that meet user needs is the most important part of this project - and where we are focussing our time. All in, we spent around 15 days on the CMS platform choice. Enough to help evaluate a limited number of options, but not enough to do a thorough review of the state of accessibility in a wide range of CMSs.</p> <p>We were surprised by the accessibility issues that cropped up in CMS platforms after our <a href="https://w3c.studio24.net/docs/w3c-cms-selection-process-update/">initial CMS review</a>. This prompted us to prioritise accessibility above other requirements due to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission#principles">principles and values of W3C</a>.</p> <h2 id="challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"> <a href="#challenges-of-gutenberg-for-now"></a> Challenges of Gutenberg (for now) </h2> <p><a href="https://www.studio24.net/">Studio 24</a> is a firm supporter of open source software and we use <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> extensively for our client work. For this project we had committed to not selecting a CMS until we’d had the chance to better understand client requirements.</p> <p>An important consideration for WordPress was accessibility concerns with the new Gutenberg editor. Many have written about the <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/my-thoughts-on-gutenberg-accessibility/">accessibility issues</a> the project has had as well as the positive <a href="https://www.marcozehe.de/whats-new-for-accessibility-in-gutenberg-7-2/">steps to improve accessibility in Gutenberg</a>.</p> <p>Gutenberg is an exciting and really interesting development. Many CMS vendors are looking at ways to allow editors to create more flexible content from compontents or blocks. However, this comes with huge challenges on how to make innovative user interfaces accessible. WordPress decided to use the JavaScript framework <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> to meet these needs.</p> <p>We <a href="https://medium.com/studio24/we-tried-converting-a-bespoke-website-design-in-wordpress-with-gutenberg-42e11986b05a">tested Gutenberg</a> six months before it was released in WordPress 5. Recently we worked on a project for the University of Cambridge creating a site for their <a href="https://magazine.alumni.cam.ac.uk/">Alumni magazine</a>. This launched in April 2020 and uses Gutenberg to manage content. This gave us a good idea of how Gutenberg works. In June, we reviewed the current accessibility issue backlog (<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29">issues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/25">a11y project</a>) and had some feedback from users with accessibility needs who had difficulties using the current user interface. This was a contributing factor in our decision that WordPress was not a good fit for this project.</p> <p>Given the importance the WordPress project has put on Gutenberg as the future of WordPress we did not feel it was reasonable to recommend using the Classic Editor if there is a good chance this will not be supported in the future. At present <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/">Classic Editor is slated for end of life in Dec 2021</a>.</p> <p>We look forward to the continued development of Gutenberg and applaud efforts to make it more accessible. We appreciate improvements have been made since our review and we’re very glad to see the <a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/">WordPress Accessibility Day</a> on 2nd October.</p> <h2 id="front-end-complexity"> <a href="#front-end-complexity"></a> Front-end complexity </h2> <p>From a business perspective I also believe Gutenberg creates a complexity issue that makes it challenging for use by many agencies who create custom websites for clients; where we have a need to create lots of bespoke blocks and page elements for individual client projects.</p> <p>The use of React complicates front-end build. We have very talented front-end developers, however, they are not React experts - nor should they need to be. I believe front-end should be built as standards-compliant HTML/CSS with JavaScript used to enrich functionality where necessary and appropriate.</p> <p>As of yet, we have not found a satisfactory (and profitable) way to build custom Gutenberg blocks for commercial projects. We won’t stop trying though and plan to do more R&amp;D with Gutenberg in the future. The W3C project, however, did not feel like the right place to do this. On a project as wide-ranging as this one, development time does become a factor.</p> <p>Drupal also has this complexity issue which makes developing sites harder than it needs to be, and is why we didn’t consider that platform either. I’ve talked to <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/torchbox-has-dropped-drupal/">other agencies who have decided to drop Drupal</a> due to its complexity.</p> <h2 id="the-question-of-open-source"> <a href="#the-question-of-open-source"></a> The question of open source </h2> <p>The W3C embraces and supports the open web. However, as an agency we also have to be practical when it comes to the tools we use to build sites. From our review, which was focussed on PHP-based CMSs, Craft and Statamic came out as meeting all the key requirements and are both very developer-friendly platforms. An important consideration for a tool that we need to hand over to W3C to maintain in the future.</p> <p>While their <a href="https://github.com/craftcms/cms">source code</a> is open, they do have commercial licenses and cost money (though a modest sum). Charging money enables small teams to develop good software, so we’re not ideologically against this business model. Both platforms are well respected in the community and well-used by professionals, running sites such as <a href="https://media.netflix.com/en/">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">Big Commerce</a> in Craft, <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/plus/">Spiegel Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a> in Statamic.</p> <p>We are using open source technology in the majority of this project (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Symfony). While Craft is a proprietary CMS, this has given us the advantage of direct access to the team developing the CMS which has helped improve accessibility in these CMSs. We hope this helps move accessibility forward in the CMS industry.</p> <p>Open tools will continue to be used to publish the standards of the web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/">Technical Reports</a> page is powered by <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony</a> and specifications will continue to be published to <a href="https://github.com/w3c">GitHub</a> to facilitate open discussion. Nothing’s changing with how the W3C work in the open.</p> <h2 id="a-note-on-front-end-delivery"> <a href="#a-note-on-front-end-delivery"></a> A note on front-end delivery </h2> <p>One final note. We are currently considering a <a href="https://www.studio24.net/blog/what-is-a-headless-cms/">Headless CMS</a> option for front-end page delivery. This means using the CMS in a decoupled way to manage content but use a separate system to deliver front-end pages. Please note this solution would not be reliant on JavaScript (e.g. a single page app which is common with headless). Under this option we’d use Symfony to deliver front-end pages which is an established technology W3C already use across a lot of the site.</p> <p>This may give W3C better flexibility for the future, though comes at a cost of added complexity. The W3C site is already made up of a lot of different systems, the CMS is just one part of the what makes up the varied content on <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a>.</p> <p>I hope this helps explain the thought process behind our decision a little more and addresses some of the valid concerns highlighted in the WordPress Tavern post.</p> <hr>  </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

                <p><strong>14 August 2020</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dear Prime Minister, </strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dear Home Secretary,</strong></p>





<p>We write to you as legal practitioners and legal academics to express our collective concerns about the violations of Mr. Julian Assange’s fundamental human, civil and political rights and the precedent his persecution is setting.</p>



<p>We call on you to act in accordance with national and international law, human rights and the rule of law by bringing an end to the ongoing extradition proceedings and granting Mr. Assange his long overdue freedom – freedom from torture, arbitrary detention and deprivation of liberty, and political persecution.</p>



<ol>
	<li><strong>ILLEGALITY OF POTENTIAL EXTRADITION TO THE UNITED STATES</strong></li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Extradition of Mr. Assange from the UK to the US would be illegal on the following grounds: </strong></p>



<ol>
	<li><strong>Risk of being subjected to an unfair trial in the US</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Extradition would be unlawful owing to failure to ensure the protection of Mr. Assange’s fundamental trial rights in the US. Mr. Assange faces show trial at the infamous “Espionage court” of the Eastern District of Virginia, before which no national security defendant has ever succeeded. Here, he faces secret proceedings before a jury picked from a population in which most of the individuals eligible for jury selection work for, or are connected to, the CIA, NSA, DOD or DOS.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup><sup>[i]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>Furthermore, Mr. Assange’s<strong> </strong>legal privilege, a right enshrined in Art. 8 European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and long recognised under English common law, was grossly violated through<strong> </strong>constant and criminal video and audio surveillance at the Ecuadorian embassy carried out by the Spanish security firm, UC Global. This surveillance was, according to witness testimony, ordered by the CIA and has triggered an investigation into the owner of UC Global, David Morales, by Spain’s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title="">[ii]</a> The surveillance resulted in all of Mr. Assange’s meetings and conversations being recorded, including those with his lawyers. The Council of Bar and Law Societies of Europe, which represents more than a million European lawyers, has expressed its concerns that these illegal recordings may be used – openly or secretly – in proceedings against Mr. Assange in the event of successful extradition to the US. The Council states that if the information merely became known to the prosecutors, this would present an irremediable breach of Mr. Assange’s fundamental rights to a fair trial under Art. 6 of the ECHR and due process under the US Constitution.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup><sup>[iii]</sup></sup></a> Furthermore, the prosecuting state obtained the totality of Mr. Assange’s legal papers after their unlawful seizure in the Embassy. Upon hearing that the Government of Ecuador was planning to seize and hand over personal belongings of Mr. Assange, including documents, telephones, electronic devices, memory drives, etc. to the US, the UN Special Rapporteur on Privacy, Joseph Cannataci, expressed his serious concern to the Ecuadorian government and twice formally requested it to return Mr. Assange's personal effects to his lawyers, to no avail.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup><sup>[iv]</sup></sup></a> <strong>The UN Model Treaty on Extradition prohibits extradition if the person has not received, or would not receive, the minimum guarantees in criminal proceedings, as enshrined in Art. 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</strong><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup><sup>[v]</sup></sup></a></p>



<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>The political nature of the offence prohibits extradition</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The US superseding indictment issued against Mr. Assange on the 24 June 2020 charges him with 18 counts all related solely to the 2010 publications of US government documents. The publications, comprising information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, US diplomatic cables and Guantanamo Bay, revealed evidence of war crimes, corruption and governmental malfeasance.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup><sup>[vi]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>Charges 1-17 are brought under the Espionage Act 1917, which, in name alone, reveals the political and antiquated nature of the charges.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup><sup>[vii]</sup></sup></a><strong> </strong>Furthermore, the essence of the 18 charges concerns Mr. Assange’s alleged intention to obtain or disclose US state “secrets” in a manner that was damaging to the strategic and national security interests of the US state, to the capability of its armed forces, the work of the security and intelligence services of the US, and to the interests of the US abroad. Thus, the conduct, motivation and purpose attributed to Mr. Assange confirm the political character of the 17 charges brought under the Espionage Act (‘pure political’ offences) and of the hacking charge (a ‘relative political’ offence). In addition, several US government officials have at various times ascribed motives “hostile” to the US to Mr. Assange, an Australian citizen.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup><sup>[viii]</sup></sup></a> <strong>The UK-US Extradition Treaty, which provides the very basis of the extradition request, specifically prohibits extradition for political offences in Art. 4(1). </strong>Yet the presiding judge and prosecution wish to simply disregard this article by referring to the Extradition Act 2003 (“EA”) instead, which does not include the political offence exception. This blatantly ignores the fact that the EA is merely an enabling act that creates the minimum statutory safeguards, but it does not preclude stronger protections from extradition as expressly provided in subsequently ratified treaties such as the UK-US Extradition Treaty. <strong>Furthermore, there is broad international consensus that political offences should not be the basis of extradition.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[ix]</sup></strong></sup></a> This is reflected in Art. 3 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, Art. 3 ECHR, Art. 3(a) of the UN Model Treaty on Extradition, the Interpol Constitution and every bilateral treaty ratified by the US for over a century.</strong></p>



<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the US</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the UN Rapporteur on Torture”), Professor Nils Melzer, has expressed with certainty that, if extradited to the US, Mr. Assange will be exposed to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Similar concerns have also been raised by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Amnesty International has recently restated its concerns in relation to the unacceptable risk of mistreatment.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup><sup>[x]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>The detention conditions, and the draconian punishment of 175 years, in a maximum security prison, which Mr. Assange faces under the US indictment, would constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, according to the current UN Rapporteur on Torture and according to the<strong> </strong>consistently expressed opinion of his predecessor, as well as of NGOs and legal authorities.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup><sup>[xi]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p>If extradited, Mr. Assange would, by the US government’s own admission, likely be placed under Special Administrative Measures. These measures prohibit prisoners from contact or communication with all but a few approved individuals, and any approved individuals would not be permitted to report information concerning the prisoner’s treatment to the public, thereby shielding potential torture from public scrutiny and government from accountability.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup><sup>[xii]</sup></sup></a></p>



<p><strong>Under the principle of non-refoulement, it is not permissible to extradite a person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for</strong> <strong>believing that they would be subjected to torture. This principle is enshrined in the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, specifically Art. 33(1) from which no derogations are permitted. Also relevant are Art. 3(1) UN Declaration on Territorial Asylum 1967, Art. 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)</strong>,<strong> and Art. 2 of the Resolution on Asylum to Persons in Danger of Persecution, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 1967. As an obligation arising from the prohibition of torture, the principle of non-refoulement in this area is absolute and also takes on the character of a peremptory norm of customary international law, i.e. jus cogens.<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xiii]</sup></strong></sup></a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Mr. Assange, who was accepted as a political asylee by the Ecuadorian government owing to what have proved to have been wholly legitimate fears of political persecution and torture in the US, should clearly have been accorded protection of this principle, firstly by Ecuador and secondly by the UK. Ecuador violated its human rights obligations by summarily rescinding Mr. Assange’s asylum in direct contradiction of the ‘Latin American tradition of asylum’<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xiv]</sup></strong></sup></a> and the Advisory Opinion </strong><strong>OC-25/18 of 30 May 2018 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affirming the principle of non-refoulement in cases of persons who have entered an embassy for protection.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><sup><strong><sup>[xv]</sup></strong></sup></a> The entry of the Ecuadorian Embassy by UK police and the arrest of Mr. Assange were thus based on an illegal revocation of his nationality and asylum, which can only be rectified by the UK upholding its own duty to protect the principle of non-refoulement by denying extradition to the US.</strong></p>



<p><strong>B) VIOLATIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE RIGHT TO KNOW</strong></p>



<p>Counts 1-17 of the indictment under the Espionage Act violate the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of the press and the right to know. These counts present standard and necessary investigative journalistic practices as criminal.<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><sup><sup>[xvi]</sup></sup></a> Such practices include indicating availability to receive information, indicating what information is of interest, encouraging the provision of information, receipt of information for the purpose of publication, and publication of information in the public interest.</p>



<p>Under the charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, the initial indictment criminalised also Mr. Assange’s alleged attempt at helping his source to maintain their anonymity while providing the documents in question, which falls squarely under the standard journalistic practice and duty of protecting the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Florin Moldoveanu researches the foundation of quantum mechanics with emphasis on quantum mechanics reconstruction and solving the measurement problem. After getting his PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Maryland at College Park in 1999, he pursued a career in industry. Three years ago he started the transition back from industry to academia and became an adjunct professor at George Mason University. His earlier graduate student research papers in theoretical physics received 267 citations to date.</p><hr><p>More than two years ago, on February 26<sup>th</sup> 2018, I was contacted by the <strong>Royal Society Open Science Journal</strong> to referee a submitted manuscript. Two prior referees had accepted the paper and two had rejected it, and I was the tiebreaker. The manuscript, <em>Quantum Correlations are Weaved by the Spinors of the Euclidean Primitives</em> by Joy Christian, basically claims that Bell’s theorem is incorrect. If true, this would be a game changer in the foundation of quantum mechanics. Bell’s theorem shows that it is impossible to construct a local realistic model of the theory.</p><p>Bell’s result is an impossibility proof; it attracts such passion as the impossibility of perpetual motion machines that were so popular some 100 years ago. A manuscript claiming the invention of a working perpetual motion device, proof that Earth is flat (yes, there is such a thing as an annual conference of Flat-Earth-ers), or that the sun circles Earth would be rejected by any respectable journal right away.</p><p>So, what if someone managed to “disprove” Bell’s theorem and, better yet, to publish that “discovery”? This would create lots of debates and excitement – certainly, notoriety and free publicity for the journal who published your claim. In other words, good business.</p><p>But who is claiming to have “disproven” Bell theorem? Enter Joy Christian, who has been asserting this claim for 13 years. It was debunked by many scientists and scientific panels over the years, yet Christian is not having any of it. Basically, he alleges to have found a method for obtaining the quantum correlation of a Bell pair of particles, by using a Bell “loophole”. In the no-mans-land at the intersection of physics, mathematics, and philosophy, experts in all three fields are scarce. Christian’s ‘method’ is based on a mathematical error, which is ultimately adding apples and oranges, but the error is hard to spot if you are not a genuine expert in geometric algebra. Add to this the language and structure of a well-written physics paper and you might convince an unsuspecting referee to approve your manuscript.</p><p>I had found Christian’s mistake again in the manuscript and I recommended to reject the paper. Certain that it would never be published, I went about my daily business. Imagine my surprise when I heard Christian had somehow managed to publish his nonsense. I thought this impossible; the vote had been 3 to 2 for rejection. I checked and found that indeed, the paper had gotten accepted after submitting a revision. <strong>However,</strong><strong>I was not contacted by the journal to review the revision. </strong>I started contacting colleagues who had to deal with Joy’s claims before, and together with Philippe Grangier, Richard Gill, Howard Wiseman, Brukner Časlav, Gregor Weihs, and Scott Aaronson, in a letter to the journal on July 28<sup>th</sup> 2018, we asked that the article be withdrawn:</p><p><em>Dear Editor-in-Chief,</em></p><p><em>We are writing to you about the publication of the paper “Quantum Correlations are weaved by the spinors of the Euclidean primitives” by Joy Christian in your journal on May 30 2018&nbsp;</em><a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/5/180526" target="_blank"><em>http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/5/180526</em></a></p><p><em>The result of this paper conflicts with an established scientific fact (Bell’s theorem) well known in the foundations of quantum physics and a basis of modern quantum information science; moreover, the subject of recent high-profile experiments (“loophole free tests of Bell’s theorem”). The paper contains numerous errors in elementary algebra, calculus, and logic. The manuscript was rejected by three of the five reviewers,&nbsp;but the editorial process as stated to the reviewers by your journal was not followed:&nbsp;the manuscript was accepted without informing the reviewers&nbsp;and giving them a chance to rebut the misleading statements made by the author (see review history on the link above).</em></p><p><em>The claims made by the author are well known from 2007 and they were disproven in the past (</em><a href="https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1577" target="_blank"><em>https://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/1577</em></a><em>&nbsp;).

This is not an acceptable course of action from an ethical point of view because it legitimizes scientific dishonesty on behalf of Joy Christian who is well aware of the issues with his arguments for more than 10 years and yet continues to obfuscate the truth.</em></p><p><em>Considering this, we are respectfully asking your journal to withdraw the paper.</em></p><p><em>Sincerely,</em></p><p><em>Florin Moldoveanu&nbsp;- George Mason University (reviewer 5)</em></p><p><em>Richard Gill – Leiden University</em></p><p><em>Howard Wiseman – Griffith University (reviewer 3)</em></p><p><em>Scott Aaronson - University of Texas</em></p><p><em>Philippe Grangier - Institute of Optics, Charles Fabry Laboratory</em></p><p><em>Brukner Caslav - IQOQI - Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Vienna</em></p><p><em>Gregor Weihs – Innsbruck University</em></p><p>This was about two years ago. We kept asking for updates, and when not stonewalling us, the journal kept pushing one roadblock after another.</p><p>The <strong>Royal Society Open Science Journal had more than two years to get their act together. By now, their silence speaks louder than words.</strong></p><p>It is unconscionable that instead of putting extra checks in place for authors with a history of inaccurate publications, the journal violated their own peer review policy and chose to maintain a faulty paper instead of withdrawing it.</p><p>We gave the journal the benefit of the doubt for two years. The passing of time made it clear that the decision to maintain the faulty paper is no accident and no mistake.</p><p>Perhaps this is a symptom of a larger systemic problem with open journals who are paid by the authors to get their papers (usually rejected elsewhere) published. When your salary and livelihood depend on the people you are supposed to enforce rules upon, the temptation to bend those rules is high.</p><p>I grew up in a former communist country of the eastern bloc. At the time of communism, a rule supposed to be enforced by the traffic police was that if you pay for a traffic ticket on the spot, you will be charged with half the fine. You might guess that most officers pocketed that money. The rule only solidified endemic corruption.</p><p>In our case, the author is well known for making the same incorrect argument over and over again. However, <strong>the root of the problem seems to be with the journal</strong>. After all, had they followed their own policy, the problem would not have arisen in the first place. And in case the mistake was genuine (as sometimes mistakes do happen), is two years enough time to get the record straight? It makes me wonder: just how often did the editors turn a blind eye to publication issues to secure revenue? <strong>Is it really a good idea that those in charge of rule enforcement are financially dependent on the rule violators? </strong></p></div></div>]]>

Turing Award</span></a><span> winner for “for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms and the design of programming languages, and in particular for his contributions to the “art of computer programming” through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title,” while </span><a href="https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/laureate/robert-endre-tarjan.html"><span>Robert Tarjan</span></a><span>, won the </span><a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/rolf-nevanlinna-prize"><span>Nevanlinna Prize</span></a><span> in 1982 “for devising near-optimal algorithms for many graph-theoretic and geometric problems for the development and exploitation of data structures supporting efficient algorithms, and for contributing several algorithmic analyses of striking profundity and elegance” and the Turing Award in 1986 “with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hopcroft"><span>John E. Hopcroft</span></a><span>, for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures.”</span></p> <p><span>Tarjan was a student of Knuth’s at Stanford, and their history together was on display in their dynamic banter. The conversation produced a number of entertaining anecdotes, such as Knuth’s concern for Tarjan’s health when he was an assistant professor. Knuth said of Tarjan, “as I sort of remember…I was very worried about you because you were proving theorems in your head as you were driving the freeways and I was afraid you would get into a wreck.” Remember kids, don’t do math and drive.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Knuth also discussed his time as the manager of the </span><a href="https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Case_Institute_of_Technology"><span>Case Institute of Technology</span></a><span> basketball team while he was an undergraduate. During his junior year he created a process to keep better statistics on each basketball player during practices and games. Then, using punch cards, he fed this data into an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650"><span>IBM 650</span></a><span> to generate strategic recommendations for the coach of the team. This system seems to have been a success — Case won more games the year they began to use Knuth’s system than they did the year before. IBM even recorded a short film about Knuth’s system called </span><i><span>The Electronic Coach</span></i><span>, which you can watch on Youtube </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhh8Ao4yweQ"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Knuth was ahead of his time — modern NBA teams rely on detailed data analytics to better understand their players and the competition; in fact during the 2013-2014 season the NBA </span><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-07-nba-stats-llc-motion-tracking-sportvu.html"><span>installed SportVu motion tracking cameras</span></a><span> in every NBA stadium. These SportVu cameras monitor the movements of every player and the basketball at 25 frames per second, generating data about everything that happens in every basketball game. NBA teams, </span><a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/moreyball-the-houston-rockets-and-analytics/"><span>most famously the Houston Rockets</span></a><span>, have used these analytics to redefine how the game is played. While three point shots are the toughest shot to make, they have a higher expected value than a long two point shot (because the difference in shooting percentage between the two is marginal), increase the spacing between players (which makes it harder to play defense), and increases the likelihood of getting an offensive rebound (because missed three point shots tend to bounce further away from the basket). Realizing this, NBA teams consistently shoot more and more threes every season. In the 1979-1980 season, the first year the three point line was introduced to the NBA, the San Diego Clippers </span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980.html"><span>led the league</span></a><span> with 6.6 three point attempts (3PA) per game. Last year the Houston Rockets smashed that number, attempting the most threes in NBA history with </span><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html"><span>45.4 attempts per game</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This is all to say that Knuth was really onto something when he had the novel idea of using a computer to better understand a basketball game.

Knuth is also an accomplished pipe organ player and a few years ago he composed, </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html"><i><span>Fantasia Apocalyptica</span></i></a><span>, a multimedia work for pipe organ. In </span><i><span>Apocalyptica </span></i><span>Knuth used a few mathematical and algorithmic methods to generate melodies. </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fant.html"><span>On his webpage</span></a><span> Knuth says:</span></p> <p><span>“At one point I thought I might have time to understand music theory well enough that I could try to teach that theory to a computer. But eventually I concluded that it would be better to create this piece almost entirely by hand, using my desktop machine only to help organize the work. Thus it’s definitely </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> “computer music”, although I do profess to be a computer scientist.</span></p> <p><span>On the other hand, I did apply some algorithms manually in a few places. For example, a haunting melody, taken from one of the earliest surviving instances of ancient Greek music, occurs ten times. I harmonized it differently each time, using the algorithm of David Kraehenbuehl that’s described in Chapter 22 of </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fg.html"><span>Selected Papers on Fun &amp; Games</span></a><span>. (See </span><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/randomness.ps.gz"><span>“Randomness in Music”</span></a><span>.)</span></p> <p><span>Mathematical methods were also used to generate the changeringing patterns that appear briefly, as well as certain melodies used for the twelve tribes of Israel and for the twelve precious jewels below the “pearly gates” of the New Jerusalem. If those methods hadn’t been successful, I would have changed the results by hand. Fortunately, I didn’t have to do that; the algorithmic approach did give a pleasing result in those cases.”</span></p> <p><span>Knuth’s diverse interests led Tarjan to ask a compelling question: “It’s been said that any field that has science in its name is not a science, so I might ask you is computer science a science, a branch of engineering, a branch of mathematics, an art — but let me ask it in a more personal way….do you see yourself as an artist, a scientist, a mathematician, an engineer, a philosopher, some combination?”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Knuth replied that he realized art stands not only for fine art but also for things that are artificial or made by human beings (as opposed to nature). He defined science as “what we understand well enough to explain to a computer” while “art is everything else.” He went on to say that as we learn more science about something our brains “keep a few jumps ahead, and that’s the art.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Finally, Knuth was asked if he had advice for students. Knuth’s response was to echo the </span><a href="https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/have-fun-life-and-career-advice-from-sir-c-antony-r-hoare-and-leslie-lamport/"><span>advice of Leslie Lamport</span></a><span> from earlier in HLF, which was to write often. However, Knuth cautioned to not be “too influenced by trendy stuff. Don’t write a paper because you have to write a paper or because you think you have to impress people about something that you aren’t personally really interested in…that’s the worst reason to write a paper.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Tarjan added to this and said, “You have to figure out what your own path is and follow it. The best students I’ve had came in with or ended up with their own idea that they developed.” Clearly both men have had success finding and following their own path. </span><b>Watch the full conversation between Tarjan and Knuth on Youtube </b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5g4Zl8ppQA"><b>here</b></a><b>. </b></p>  </div></div>]]>

<p>This week we continue our four-part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/09/18/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-mining/">I</a>, II, III, IV) look at pre-modern iron and steel production.  Last week we prospected our iron ore and extracted it from the ground and did some initial mechanical processing (washing, sorting, crushing).  This week, we’re going to make our way from just rocks to an actual mass of <em>metal</em> rather than just some metal-bearing ore.  As we’ll see, we are going to do this by applying <em>heat</em> and (more importantly) <em><strong>chemistry</strong></em>:</p>

<p>The reader may be pardoned for having gotten to this point expecting to begin with exciting furnaces, bellowing roaring flames and melting all and sundry.  <strong>The thing is, all of that energy has to come from somewhere and that somewhere is, by and large, wood</strong>.  Now it is absolutely true that there are other common fuels which were probably frequently experimented with and sometimes used, but don’t seem to have been used widely.  Manure, used as cooking and heating fuel in many areas of the world where trees were scarce, doesn’t – to my understanding – reach sufficient temperatures for use in iron-working.  Peat seems to have similar problems, although my understanding is it can be reduced to charcoal like wood; I haven’t seen any clear evidence this was often done, although one assumes it must have been tried.</p>



<p>Instead, the fuel I gather most people <em>assume</em> was used (to the point that it is what many video-game crafting systems set for) was coal.  The problem with coal is that it has to go through a process of <em>coking</em> in order to create a pure mass of carbon (called ‘coke’) which is suitable for use.  Without that conversion, the coal itself both does not burn hot enough, but also is apt to contain lots of sulfur, which will ruin the metal being made with it, as the iron will absorb the sulfur and produce an inferior alloy (sulfur makes the metal brittle, causing it to break rather than bend, and makes it harder to weld too).  Indeed, the reason we <em>know</em> that the Romans in Britain experimented with using local coal this way is that analysis of iron produced at Wilderspool, Cheshire during the Roman period revealed the presence of sulfur in the metal which was likely from the coal on the site.</p>



<p>We have records of early experiments with methods of coking coal in Europe beginning in the late 1500s, but the first truly successful effort was that of Abraham Darby in 1709.  Prior to that, it seems that the use of coal in iron-production in Europe was minimal (though coal might be used as a fuel for other things like cooking and home heating).  In China, development was more rapid and there is evidence that iron-working was being done with coke as early as the eleventh century.  But apart from that, by and large the fuel to create all of the heat we’re going to need is going to come from <strong>trees</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>And, as we’ll see, really quite a lot of trees.  Indeed, a <em>staggering</em> number of trees, if iron production is to be done on a major scale</strong>.  The good news is we needn’t be <em>too </em>picky about what trees we use;  ancient writers go on at length about the very specific best woods for ships, spears, shields, or pikes (fir, cornel, poplar or willow, and ash respectively, for the curious), but are far less picky about fuel-woods.  Pinewood seems to have been a consistent preference, both Pliny (<em>NH</em> 33.30) and Theophrastus (<em>HP</em> 5.9.1-3) note it as the easiest to use and Buckwald (<em>op cit</em>.) notes its use in medieval Scandinavia as well.  But we are also told that chestnut and fir also work well, and we see a fair bit of birch in the archaeological record.  So we have our trees, more or less.</p>



<h2>Forests and Fellers</h2>



<p>The bad news is that while ancient sources are often <em>very</em> interested in trees (entire books about them, in fact), they are generally interested in trees used to make things like ships, buildings, furniture and weapons; essentially, elite products.  They are <em>not</em> interested in trees used as fuel.  Indeed, Latin marks this distinction, where wood for building was <em>materia</em> whereas wood for burning (but also, it seems, bulk wood being transported overseas) was <em>lignum</em>; our sources care greatly about the former and only minimally about the latter.  And so as soon as we get very far into the question of the harvesting and preparation of fuel woods, our evidence just about drops away entirely, save for a few poor mentions of this or that tree being good for charcoaling (a crucial process we’ll get to in a moment).</p>

<p>Consequently, our ability to see the fellows felling the forests (say <em>that</em> five times fast) is limited.  Medieval ‘foresters’ are often more visible, but much like we noted last time that when Georgius Agricola says ‘miner’ he means ‘mine owner,’ my understanding is that foresters in the Middle Ages were something closer to <em>administrators</em> of the forest (responsible for letting out contracts, catching poachers, etc.; essentially a sheriff but in the woods) rather than simple tree-fellers.</p>



<p>So who did the actual tree-cutting?  I must confess, I have found relatively little evidence for the social standing of ancient tree-fellers. <strong> In quite a lot of cases, they must not have been meaningfully distinct from the local peasantry or other sources of unskilled rural labor.</strong>  Clearly a lot of woodcutting was done by the rural population that bordered the forests to clear spaces for fields, gather fuel and firewood and so on, and consequently it seems like the basic skills of tree-felling may have been relatively common. The Latin word for a wood-cutter was a <em>lignator</em> (or sometimes a <em>caesor</em>, which meant ‘cutter’ but could mean of wood (<em>lignorum caesores</em>) or of stone), but that word most often appears in military contexts to mean soldiers tasked with cutting wood for fuel, not full-time lumberjacks.  Evidence for the medieval period is somewhat better and also generally suggests that the local peasantry was employed in the wood-cutting itself (for this, note J. Birrell, “Peasant Craftsmen in the Medieval Forest” <em>Agricultural History Review</em> 17.2 (1969): 91-107).  <strong>As we will see below, often wood cut for charcoaling was cut by the colliers themselves</strong>, who we will discuss below.  It seems hard to imagine that there wasn’t some division of labor in larger operations (like on Elba or at Populonia), but how that might have been structured is not clear from the limited evidence.</p>



<p>Not all timber works were so easily acquired, of course.  While ancient wood-cutters are hard to see in the evidence, ancient sawyers and carpenters are more visible; records from building programs in Athens and Delphi suggest that skilled sawyers (seemingly always assisted by at least one unskilled worker) were paid at least as well as citizen oarsmen in the Athenian navy and in some cases rather better.  The presence of English surnames like Carpenter, Cooper, Fletcher, Bowyer, Turner, Sawyer and Wheeler speak to the fact that these were specialized crafts in medieval England; the absence of wood-<em>cutting</em> surnames further suggests that the bulk labor of felling was mostly done by the local rural workforce.  <strong>Consequently, the social status of the average timber-cutter seems to have been about the same as that of a local peasant, serf or small-farmer, because by and large these seem to have been the same people</strong>; while the work done once the tree was down and barked might be done by specialists (but is far less important for trees that are going to be charcoaled).  There were also clearly specialist timber merchants, even in the ancient world, and the degree of their visibility, especially in timber-rich regions suggests that they could do quite well for themselves (although, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/21/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iv-markets-and-non-farmers/">like most merchants</a>, we effectively never see them penetrate into the ruling class), but again, these merchants were likely working with building timbers because, as we’ll see, charcoal wood doesn’t tend to travel very far.</p>

High quality building timbers or ship timbers do seem to have been valuable enough to be worth shipping long distances (Athens famously imported its ship-timber from Macedon), but fuel timbers tended to come from closer to hand.  But I <strong>had</strong> this picture and I wanted to use it.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The largest stock of forest-land was typically owned by the state, but private landholders owning their own forests also played a role, albeit generally a small one</strong>.  In Macedon, the king owned the forests and controlled the supply of lumber, granting or revoking the authority for communities within his territory to take advantage of woodland resources; the practice seems to have been the same, Meiggs (<em>op cit</em>.) notes, in the Near East.  In Roman Italy, a large amount of the forest-land was held by the state and contracted out for timber-cutting;<em> </em>Meiggs supposes that figures called <em>saltuarii</em> may have been responsible for making sure that …</p></div></div>

Some are geared towards beginners while others focus on advanced topics.</p><p id="993e">So, if you consider yourself an experienced programmer, you can jump over to the last section where you’ll find all the 22 YouTube channels.</p><p id="2c67">If you are a beginner developer, however, I recommend that you go through each section of this article as we’ll talk about coding in general, programming skills, your computer programming resume, job opportunities, and some of the most in-demand programming languages.</p><p id="65e3">Without further ado:</p><p id="359c">Coding is the end result of a specific set of actions triggered to create a tangible result, whether it is a web page, an app, a video, or just an image on your screen.</p><p id="c92e">The great thing about computer coding (or programming) is that you can have a big idea and actually code it out into reality. And it doesn’t cost much, barring some time and effort on your side.</p><p id="3e5a">Many non-tech people consider the definition of a computer programmer to be someone who just makes programs. Although that’s partly true, partly not, it’s a mistake. Managers believe that the more lines of code a programmer can produce a month, the more creative he will be — another mistake. You can’t put a <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.codegiant.io/software-developer-vs-software-engineer-31e873e787bc">developer</a> into a cubicle, set a deadline, ask him to work for 8–9 hours straight, and expect a top-notch quality software at the end.</p><p id="9e66">Instead of thinking about the programs a developer composes, one should consider the possible computations evoked by the developed program. “Designing a set of computations” is a more accurate description of what programmers actually do.</p><p id="5647">One can also imagine programmers as writers that have to think and write carefully, because the readers (the computers) take what the programmers write literally.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2330/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi" width="1165" height="805" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*al-_-Anr6m8BIIIi?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="f506">Many non-tech folks believe that programming is all about acquiring technical skills. I believe that being a developer requires more than just knowing how to code. To make it in the software development world, you’ll need to dig up some creativity and inject it into your coding skills. The ability to think analytically is highly valued among developers as well.</p><p id="1779">One of the most essential skills a developer can have isn’t actually technical, it’s social, and that is empathy. Lack of empathy inevitably leads to poor communication (barring you are a narcissist, sociopath, or psychopath and therefore can be charming as hell). On the other hand, being able to put empathy into practice will, without doubt, boost your career opportunities.</p><p id="9732">When it comes to <strong>planning software</strong>, developers should know how to use models and flowcharts to convey instructions clearly.</p><p id="c39f"><strong>Designing and creating applications</strong>. Depending on the project, this can take from a couple of weeks to months and sometimes even years to complete.</p><p id="9b77"><strong>Writing programs</strong>.

Most times, you’ll need to modify and update existing programs with extra features.</p><p id="e7df"><strong>Debugging code</strong>. Yup.</p><p id="5ef0"><strong>Simplify programming</strong>.

You gotta be programming in your spare time; you gotta be obsessed with it. Load yourself with patience because becoming a skilled coder takes years. And anyone who is telling you that you can learn and become good at coding in a month is probably trying to sell you something.</p><p id="8e25">Senior developers have all adopted common traits and basic coding skills that have helped them to rise in the hierarchy during their programming careers. Here are some valuable skills needed for you to be a senior developer:</p><p id="3a2c">One, being able to easily explain tech stuff to non-technical people.</p><p id="b60e">Two, being able to come up with accurate estimates.</p><p id="8cdb">Three, willingness to roll up their sleeves and do some grunt work.</p><p id="49a8">Four, knowing when to raise an issue to upper management.</p><p id="ff3f">Five, the ability to mentor junior developers.</p><p id="eb41">Six, vast knowledge of the technicalities for their domain.</p><h2 id="5ec1">Understand how the language works</h2><p id="e035">Focus on one language while learning. Having your focus split between two or three languages will discombobulate you.</p><p id="c797">It becomes obvious when a programmer doesn’t have a good understanding of the programming language he’s using. He’ll try to solve problems by following the logic of other languages and thus litter the code with unnecessary statements that can otherwise be reduced to fewer lines.</p><p id="094c">Also, you must know how to organize code into a system that makes sense. Creating rigid classes, schemas, and hierarchies require you to first think them through. Design can be a broad topic so I won’t cover much, but if you wish to read more, head over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p id="e256">Poorly designed software lacks well-defined concepts, and its responsibilities are vague. Good software, on the other hand, comes with clear concepts and responsibilities. Take a look at mathematicians and physicists. They spend a huge amount of time trying to develop a clear definition of something because that will allow them to understand the truth about it. Developers should take a similar approach and spend a considerable amount of time brainstorming before writing code. Yes, this might be controversial to Agile but you gotta do what you gotta do.</p><p id="8ecf">It’s better to sit down with the dev team initially and outline all the required tasks than to go through 10 rounds of code reviews later.</p><p id="ea9f">Perhaps the best way to learn about design is to write and study many programs written by experienced programmers. As you gain more coding experience, you’ll, without doubt, enhance your design skills and expand your knowledge.</p><p id="0729">Good programmers ask questions like:</p><ul><li id="ff87">What’s the goal of this function?</li><li id="ee63">How can I explain this data structure to my teammates?</li><li id="771f">Can this function represent two standalone tasks?</li><li id="0e31">What’s the responsibility of this snippet of code?</li><li id="0f32">What should I include in the public interface?</li></ul><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2648/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt" width="1324" height="919" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*uR00-riTaFDc4QFt?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="d2d4">Most people think that you need a diploma from Harvard or universities alike to be considered for a job in big tech companies. Although that may be partially true (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html" rel="noopener">not always though, it seems Apple and Google no longer require you to have a college degree</a>), some companies prefer the opposite, or at least don’t want you to be coming for Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, etc.</p><p id="3c6c">There are CEOs out there looking for developers that are qualified but not overly qualified… hard workers, being on time, but also leaving at the stroke of 5. Such CEOs consider Ivy League schools to be a red flag. Big resumes are also a red flag. That’s because developers coming from such schools can’t get off their high horse, question whether every decision is optimal, and are always hungry for praise, recognition, and “interesting work.”</p><p id="c97a">Instead, these CEOs are looking for loyal people who know how to take orders without questioning, and are ready to do the work, day in and day out, because they need the paycheck at the end of the month.</p><p id="6749">At a glance, this might seem quite controversial. Yet, there are developers out there who don’t want to become millionaire CTOs at the age of 30. Instead, they are satisfied with what they have on their plate: a steady job, fair pay, and that’s about it. Some companies with that kind of culture say that they have produced a 100% employee retention rate which means developers are happy with their work environment.</p><h2 id="11a4">Let’s talk about your resume now.</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1964/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK" width="982" height="911" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*P0TDzRLC7SaDQKzK?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="2aa7">So, what should you list on your resume?</p><p id="8bab">Proficiency in programming languages is, ostensibly, a vital thing to include. Always remember that companies are getting tens, hundreds, even thousands of applications a month. All of which say “I can do X.” The thing is skill level varies between each applicant. You should describe your coding experience and give examples of successful projects you’ve completed.</p><p id="dbb6">When listing your most valuable programming skills, there are a couple of things you need to know in order to have a fully optimized programming resume.</p><ol><li id="72b7">Before sending your resume, always go through the job description a couple of times and try to understand what is relevant to the job you are applying for. Then make yourself relevant to the job.</li><li id="dd11">Always be honest with yourself. Don’t list programming languages you don’t know because they are mentioned in the job description.

				<p>Either you love gorgeous typography or just don’t care. If you are the former read ahead on how to make the font rendering on your Linux look just as awesome as that on macOS, else read on to find out what beauty you have been missing.</p>
<p>I switched to a hackintosh for a while and fell in love with how beautiful the typography was. After returning to Linux and some fiddiling around I came across a not so ugly setup that looked close enough to macOS. So if you want to make your Linux Distro a tad bit typographically better, follow along.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>This is how the fonts look on the default installation of Manjaro Linux.

<h3 id="some-pointers">Some Pointers</h3>
<p>Rather than copy pasting everything on here, let’s try to understand why the fonts on macOS looks better than the ones we have on Linux.</p>
<p>Fonts belong to certain types.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> : Well the sans fonts on your computer. The regular plain fonts.</li>
<li><code>serif</code> : The fonts that look like they came out of a 14th century Bible. You know with the curves and they look like showoffs.</li>
<li><code>monospace</code> : The typical code font. The ones where every character is the same width.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason fonts look way better on macOS is because Steve Jobs loved typography, and he went the extra mile and licensed some great typefaces for each font type, and recently Apple put in the extra effort to make their custom fonts even better. Well fret not Linux has some free fonts that are metric compatible(means they look awfully similar), and better that we can substitute for fonts.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Step one is installing the fonts that look similar or better than the ones on macOS.
All the fonts that are used here can be found on the Arch Repositories, and on Google Fonts. You are free to replace everything with the ones you find great.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sans-serif</code> : tex-gyre-fonts, free alternative to Helvetica and Arial and looks really really similar</li>
<li><code>serif</code> : Libertinus Serif, suprisingly looks really great</li>
<li><code>monospace</code> : DM Mono from Google Fonts, for monospace fonts that look great</li>
<li><code>emoji</code> : noto-fonts-emoji, get some colorful emojis</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Manjaro or Arch here is the command to get all fonts in one go.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">yay -S tex-gyre-fonts otf-libertinus noto-fonts-emoji
</code></pre></div><h3 id="font-setup">Font Setup</h3>
<p>Everything about fonts can be configured from a single file located at <code>/etc/fonts/local.conf</code> if the file doesn’t exist create it. You do require <code>sudo</code> for it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">sudo nvim /et/fonts/local.conf
</code></pre></div><p>After you are editing the file copy paste everything here.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

</code></pre></div><p>What this file does that is it creates aliases for the common fonts used on the web and uses the metric compatible fonts that we have. That way we have way better looking fonts.</p>
<p>After you have done all this, restart your computer to see the changes.</p>
<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>
<p>If you are using chrome, you can do something more too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goto Settings</li>
<li>Select Customize Fonts under Appearences</li>
<li>Set Standard to <code>Libertinus Serif</code></li>
<li>Set Serif to <code>Libertinus Serif</code></li>
<li>Set Sans-serif to <code>TeX Gyre Heros</code></li>
<li>Set Fixed-width to <code>Monospace</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interface-text">Interface Text</h3>
<p>For Desktop Environments like Gnome and KDE, you could use Tex-Gyre-Heros for the overall Helvetica look. I use Gnome 3.36 and use <code>TeX Gyre Heros Regular 10</code> as my interface text.</p>
<p>That’s all set, and keep in mind this guide will be improved.</p>

    <p> <i>Dear Reader: although this post mentions Clojure as an example, it is not specifically about Clojure; please do not make it part of a language war. If you know other configurations which allow for a productive REPL experience, please describe them in the comments!</i></p><p> <img src="https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/img/repl.gif" width="100%"></p><p>Most comparisons I see of Clojure to other programming languages are in terms of its programming language <em>semantics</em>:  immutability, homoiconicity, data-orientation, dynamic typing, first-class functions, polymorphism 'à la carte'...  All of these are interesting and valuable features, but what actually gets me to <em>choose</em> Clojure for projects is its interactive  development story, enabled by <em>the REPL</em> (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which lets you evaluate Clojure expressions in an interactive  shell (including expressions which let you modify the state or behaviour of a running program).  </p><p>If you're not familiar with Clojure, you may be surprised that I describe the REPL as Clojure's most differentiating feature:   after all, most industrial programming languages come with REPLs or 'shells' these days (including Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Scala,  Haskell, ...). However, I've never managed to reproduced the productive REPL workflow I had in Clojure with those languages;  the truth is that <strong>not all REPLs are created equal</strong>.</p><p>In this post, I'll try to describe what a 'good' REPL gives you, then list some technical characteristics which make some REPLs   qualify as 'good'. Finally, I'll try to reflect on what programming language features give REPLs the most leverage.</p><h2 id="what_does_a_good_repl_give_you?">What does a good REPL give you?</h2><p>The short answer is: by providing a <i>tight feedback loop</i>, and making your programs <i>tangible</i>,  a REPL helps you deliver programs with significantly higher productivity and quality.  If you're wondering why a tight feedback loop is important for creative activities such as programming, I recommend you watch  <a href="https://www.vimeo.com/36579366">this talk by Bret Victor</a>.</p><p>If you have no idea what REPL-based development looks like, I suggest you watch a few minutes of  <a href="https://vimeo.com/230220635" target="_blank">the following video</a>:</p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/230220635" width="640" height="359" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Now, here's the long answer: <i>A good REPL gives you...</i></p><h3 id="a_smooth_transition_from_manual_to_automated">A smooth transition from manual to automated</h3><p>The vast majority of the programs we write essentially automate tasks that humans can do themselves.  Ideally, to automate a complex task, we should be able to break it down into smaller sub-tasks, then gradually automate each of the subtasks until reaching a fully-automated solution.  If you were to build a sophisticated machine like a computer from scratch, you would want to make sure you understand how the individual components work before putting them together, right?  Unfortunately, this is not what we get with the typical write/(compile)/run/watch-stdout workflow, in which we essentially put all the pieces together blindly and pray it works the first time we hit 'run'.  The story is different with a REPL: you will have played with each piece of code in isolation before running the whole program,  which makes you quite confident that each of the sub-tasks is well implemented.</p><p>This is also true in the other direction: when a fully-automated program breaks, in order to debug it,  you will want to re-play some of the sub-tasks manually.</p><p>Finally, not all programs need be fully automated - sometimes the middle ground between manual and automated is exactly what you want.  For instance, a REPL is a great environment to run ad hoc queries to your database, or perform ad hoc data analysis, while leveraging  all of the automated code you have already written for your project - much better than working with database clients, especially when  you need to query several data stores or reproduce advanced business logic to access the data.</p><p>How's life without a REPL? Here's a list of things that we do to cope with these issues when we don't have a REPL:</p><ul><li>Experiment with interactive tools such as cURL or database clients, then reproduce what we did in code.  Problem: you can't connect these in any way with your existing codebase. These tools are good at experimenting manually,  but then you have to code all the way to bridge the gap between making it work with these tools and having it work in your project.</li><li>Run scripts which call our codebase to print to standard output our files. Problem: you need to know exactly what to output before writing the script; you can't hold on to program state and <em>improvise</em> from there, as we'll discuss in the next section.</li><li>Use unit tests (possibly with auto-reloading), which have a number of limitations in this regard, as we'll see later in this post.</li></ul><h3 id="a_repl_lets_you_improvise">A REPL lets you improvise</h3><p>Software programming is primarily and <i>exploratory</i> activity.  If we had a precise idea of how our programs should work before writing them, we'd be <i>using</i> code, not writing it.</p><p>Therefore, we should be able to write our programs incrementally, one expression at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step,  <i>walking the machine through</i> our current thinking. This is simply not what the  compile/run-the-whole-thing/look-at-the-logs workflow gives you.</p><p>In particular, one situation where this ability is critical is fixing bugs in an emergency.  When you have to reproduce the problem, isolate the cause, simulate the fix and finally apply it, a REPL is often the  difference between minutes and hours.</p><p>Fun fact: maybe the most spectacular occurrence of this situation was the fixing of a bug  of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gZK0tW8EhQ">Deep Space 1</a> probe in 1999,  which fortunately happened to run a Common Lisp REPL while drifting off course several light-minutes away from Earth.</p><h3 id="a_repl_lets_you_write_fewer_tests,_faster">A REPL lets you write fewer tests, faster</h3><p>Automated tests are very useful for expressing what your code is supposed to do,  and giving you confidence that it works and keeps working correctly.</p><p>However, when I see some TDD codebases, it seems to me that a lot of unit tests are mostly here to make the code more tangible while developing, which is the same value proposition as using a REPL. However, using unit tests for this purpose comes with its lot of issues:</p><ol><li>Having too many unit tests makes your codebase harder to evolve. You ideally want to have as few tests as possible capture as many properties of your domain as possible.</li><li>Tests can only ever answer close-ended questions: "does this work?", but not "how does this work?", "what does this look like?" etc.</li><li>Tests typically won't run in real-world conditions: they'll use simple, artificial data and mocks of services such as databases or API clients. As a result, they don't typically help you understand a problem that only happens on real-life data, nor do they give you confidence that the real-life implementations of the services they emulate do work.</li></ol><p>So it seems to me a lot of unit tests get written for lack of a better solution for interactivity,  even though they don't really pull their weight as unit tests.  When you have a REPL, you can make the choice to only write the tests that matter.</p><p>What's more, the REPL <i>helps you</i> write these tests. Once you have explored from the REPL, you can just copy and paste  some of the REPL history to get both example data and expected output. You can even use the REPL to assist you in writing  the fixture data for your tests by generating it programmatically (everyone who has written comprehensive fixture datasets  by hand knows how tedious this can get). Finally, when writing the tests require implementing some non-trivial logic  (as is the case when doing Property-Based Testing), the productivity benefits of the REPL for writing code applies to writing tests as well.</p><p>Again, do <i>not</i> take from this that a REPL is a replacements for tests. Please do write tests, and let the REPL help you  write the right tests effectively.</p><h3 id="a_repl_makes_you_write_accessible_code">A REPL makes you write accessible code</h3><p>A REPL-based workflow encourages you to write programs which manipulate values that are <strong><i>easy to fabricate.</i></strong>  If you need to set up a complex graph of objects before you can make a single method call, you won't be very inclined to use the REPL.  </p><p>As a result, you'll tend to write <strong><i>accessible code</i></strong> - with few dependencies, little environmental coupling, high modularity,   and tangible inputs and outputs.  This is likely to make your code more clear, easy to test, and easy to debug.  </p><p>To be clear, this <i>is</i> an additional constraint on your code (it requires some upfront thinking to make your code REPL-friendly,  just likes it requires some upfront thinking to make your code easy to test) - but I believe it's a very beneficial constraint.

<p>There’s an ongoing discussion about what makes Python better prototyping
language than Rust (with Python being probably just the archetype of some
scripted weakly-typed language). The thing is, I prefer doing my prototypes in
Rust over Python. Apparently, I’m not the only one. So I wanted to share few
things about what makes Rust viable for these kinds of throw-away coding
sprints, at least for me.</p>

<h2 id="our-goals">Our goals</h2>

<p>Sometimes, our goal isn’t really to write perfect code that is performant,
correct, handles all kinds of errors sanely, has great UX and is maintainable.
These projects are what we are proud of, sure. We pin them on github profiles.
We write blog posts about them. We write whole handbooks of best practices how
to do them.</p>

<p>But sometimes we just need to throw something together really fast and don’t
care about the quality as much. That kind of bit of cardboard and huge amount of
duck tape thing. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single-use debugging tools („I need to throw 10k of these weird requests at
the server to see if it triggers the bug. It didn’t? Ok, let’s try something
else…“)</li>
  <li>Searching for a counter-example to a claim in a scientific paper („I can prove
it’s a counter example once I have it, so I won’t need the code any more“)</li>
  <li>Processing bunch of data just once („I wonder how many of these <code>.txt</code> files
have broken unicode in them“)</li>
  <li>Figuring if something has any chance to fly at all, before committing to it
(„Could I distribute the changes as compressed binary diffs, or would that be
too large?“)</li>
  <li>Demonstration purposes („We would like to build something in lines of this,
but, you know, actually working“)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there’s a lot more. I’m not even sure if there’s more of the „proper“
coding or of this „throw away“ coding. Except that we don’t really brag about
our throw-away code („Look what terrible monster I’ve stitched together during
the lunch break“), we don’t write tutorials how to write them much, etc. So this
is exactly the kind of blog post we don’t write 😈.</p>

<p>Instead of writing something proper this time, we are going to talk about
how to write terrible code, but fast. We have decided to make an explicitly
sloppy job of this one and admit it to ourselves not to feel ashamed of it
later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We want to spend as little time on it as possible. Just do it, throw the code
away after it had its use and move on. This one is going to be over by lunch
time.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about performance that much (as long as it finishes running
before the lunch too).</li>
  <li>We don’t care about handling all corner cases, only the ones we actually
encounter in the data.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about documentation or readability.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about tests, provided we are confident enough the answers are
accurate enough.</li>
  <li>Actually, we don’t really care at all…</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: make sure not to let anyone put this into production 😇. If you don’t
delete it, make sure there’s a comment on a prominent place warning people not
to use it.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-do-people-think-python-fits-here-better-than-rust">Why do people think Python fits here better than Rust</h2>

<p>The thing is, Rust <em>makes us</em> care. That’s one of the points of Rust. It’ll
complain that our code is not production quality and that we need to do better
to save on the pain down the line. Its type system can be a real prick in
insisting on little details, like that ints and strings are not really the same
thing and that there’s a difference between owned and borrowed thing and… Well,
you know, all that stuff. Rust wants you to make good, proper, maintainable
code.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Python doesn’t really insist on anything. Therefore, it is
easier to not care in Python.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-experience">My own experience</h2>

<p>I know a bunch of programming languages and reach for the one that I hope would
suit me best in the given time. So, for some really simple things I simply put
together few lines of shell (and some slightly less simple ones ‒ I’m ashamed to
admit that some 1000 lines long shell monster kept running in real production
for years ‒ but it <em>did run</em>). If it can be done by 2 or 3 ugly pipelines, it’s
fine.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve used Perl a lot (that one doesn’t care if it’s int or
string… no, correction, in Perl everything is a string, ints just don’t exist.
Well, kind of). It’s probably <em>the</em> language designed for throw away coding.
I’ve done some Python too (that’s like Perl, but with proper objects in it, and
everything is a dictionary there).</p>

<p>But recently I’ve noticed that if I try to do a similar thing, I do it faster in
Rust. Not that it runs faster (well, that usually too, but that’s not the
point), but that I’m done with the task at hand sooner and with slightly smaller
amount of cursing.</p>

<p>This certainly is in part because I’m more proficient in Rust than in Python.
It’s also because the Rust mental model is closer to how my brain works than the
Python one. <strong>Your mileage will vary</strong> ‒ if you’re a Python matador who’s been
coding in it for decades and are just learning Rust, you’ll certainly do it
faster in Python.</p>

<p>But also, there are some tricks you might employ to do these things in Rust
faster (that is, faster than you do now, not necessarily faster than in
<code>$OTHER_LANGUAGE</code>).</p>

<h2 id="tricks-for-faster-coding">Tricks for faster coding</h2>

<h3 id="compile-times">Compile times</h3>

<p>Rust is known for its slow compile times. Python has <em>no</em> compile times. If you
have to wait every time for the compilation just to have a bunch of errors
thrown into your face, it’s going to slow you down. Especially because Rust
<em>likes to</em> throw bunch of errors at you every time you try to compile it. Rust
is known for its great error messages, so it wants to brag how good they are by
using them <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>You can, however, notice that you don’t really need to <em>build and run</em> every
time. That you often just want to check everything is on the right path. For
Python, you do need to actually run the thing (because Python doesn’t really
have much of a compile time so it likes to throw the bunch of errors into your
face at <em>run time</em>), but Rust is the language that „if
it compiles, it’s correct“. And by complies, I actually mean mostly type-checks.</p>

<p>What does this all mean? You can check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>rust-analyzer</code> language server. You’ll be getting red squiggles in the
editor instead of having to compile. It’s not perfect (sometimes the list of
errors is different, sometimes it just gives up on that particular project),
but it’s getting better and it points out most of the errors without any
compilation at all.</li>
  <li><code>cargo check</code> performs just the first stages of compilation and will stop
before codegen. It means it doesn’t produce anything that could be run, but
it is so much faster and provides the bunch of errors we so much want to have.</li>
  <li>You can let <code>cargo watch</code> keep recompiling the code asynchronously in another
terminal. I just glance at it to check if there are any errors around, but I
don’t wait for it ‒ at worst, the list of errors is one iteration outdated. It
can be used for other things, like keeping the documentation of the current
crate up to date, or having a head start at compiling the executable, or even
having all the tests being re-run on each save (I’m getting off topic here; we
are being sloppy here on purpose, so what tests are we talking about?)</li>
</ul>

<p>These don’t make the compile times shorter, but it eliminates the <em>waiting</em> for
them from the hot coding path. It still takes some time to compile (especially
if you have a lot of dependencies and do a clean release build), but that
doesn’t mean it has to slow you down.</p>

<h3 id="embrace-the-type-system-and-borrow-checker-and-all-of-these-things">Embrace the type system (and borrow checker and all of these things)</h3>

<p>After some time working with Rust, one learns to lean onto them instead of
fighting them.</p>

<p>This is where most of my own speed up comes from and what I miss about Python.
When I want to know if my code is working, I actually have to run the Python
thing and feed it with data. Which means I either need to set up a smaller input
or wait for the whole thing to get crunched, only to have it explode on some
typo or switched order of parameters after 5 minutes of running. After 10
iterations of running the Python code (each crashing later and later in the
code), it finally finishes. By that time, I’m no longer confident it does what
it should, after all these retries, so I go back and have to figure a way to
double-check it.</p>

<p>In Rust not only I don’t have to run the code until it is almost finished and
even when I feed it the whole input (which I usually do), it’s usually faster
and it runs to completion the first time. I also can move through the code much
faster. With Python, I stop to check the documentation, think about what type
goes where, etc, exactly because it’s so painful to find out only at runtime. I
need to be careful while writing the code.
With Rust, I just type the code, get the red squiggly, fix it and move on. I
outsource that effort of checking if these things click together in any
meaningful way to the compiler.</p>

<p>This is kind of in the theme of „hurry slowly“ approach. By making sure
everything has the right types and aligns well, it makes each iteration slower.
But it also makes it possible to have much fewer iterations before the whole
thing works well enough.</p>

<p>Also, don’t fall for the impression that throwing <code>unsafe</code> in there to bypass
some of the checking will save you time. It won’t. It’s a trap. If you don’t
know for sure that you need it, then you probably don’t and doing <code>unsafe</code> right
is a lot of work. Doing it wrong is easy, maybe easier than doing it safely, but
you’ll pay for it later on, when trying to figure out why the thing does
something arcanely weird. If you put any non-trivial <code>unsafe</code> in the code,
you’re risking spending days and nights in front of a debugger. The checks are
there for a reason.</p>

<h3 id="take-the-easy-way-out">Take the easy way out</h3>

<p>I don’t say to clone everything. Even in prototyping code, I often take <code>&amp;str</code>
as parameter if it’s just „looking at it“. But I do so in the obvious, trivial
cases. The ones I don’t really need to think about any more.</p>

<p>But if you ever find yourself thinking about writing any kind of
<code>-&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = &amp;impl Display&gt; + '_</code>, just stop and throw a
<code>Vec&lt;String…</code></p></section></div></div>

Time zones are hard. Dealing with time zones in software development?  Yeah, <strong>harder</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>4</strong> places where time zones might differ; and 4 personal bug stories for each case. I'll be referring to the same app for each story, the one I work with and maintain in my day-to-day job. This app works with Mexico's City time zone.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-app">Time zone of your app</h2>
<p>Your app runs with a default time zone. It's usually the time zone of the server it runs on, but it can be different.</p>
<p>In Java, you can define the time zone of the whole application when it boots. If for some reason you don't want to work with your server's timezone, this is the place to change it.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-time-in-chile-off-by-one-hour">The bug - Time in Chile off by one hour</h3>
<p>The app shows the date of creation of an object in many places. Three of these places were showing different times; <strong>two incorrect and one correct</strong>.</p>
<p>One error was because I forgot to pass the user's timezone to the date formatter. Quick fix.</p>
<p>The second error was weird. I couldn't identify why, so I compared it with the correct one.</p>
<p>But the third case was only right because the date had been double parsed! Once on the server and a second time on the client (browser).</p>
<p>So none of the three dates were actually correct. <strong>WTF?</strong></p>
<p>After some headaches, I learned that each version of Java comes with a time zone data file. This file includes the latest information on the world's time zones, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</a> manages it. </p>
<p>Time zone changes happen when governments decide to apply or not to apply daylight saving times (DST). </p>
<p>In 2015, Chile decided to move from seasonal DST to permanent DST, and some JRE releases included this change. But then, in 2016 Chile decided to revert to how it was before; seasonal DST instead of permanent. <strong>What was the issue?</strong> The app was using one of these JRE releases with an outdated time zone data file.</p>
<p>You can read more about these <a target="_blank" href="https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0622033">DST issues with Java here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-server">Time zone of your server</h2>
<p>The operative system defines your server's time zone. I've always used Linux for production servers, and they come with UTC as the default time zone.</p>
<p>If you need to change this time zone, make sure to do it before your application starts or it won't reflect the change.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-app-using-the-wrong-default-time-zone-from-the-server">The bug - App using the wrong default time zone from the server</h3>
<p>I was migrating some processes in our build and deployment pipeline. From configuring the app with every deploy to a pre-built AWS Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with HashiCorp's Packer.</p>
<p>One step of the initial configuration was to change the server's time zone to America/Mexico_City, and I was aware of it. So I created a bash script that changed the time zone on the AMI we were going to use. The script worked well when I tested it on a Linux instance. No problem there.</p>
<p>I proceeded to use this AMI in our staging environment and neither I nor my teammates noticed something off. So, to production!</p>
<p>Customer's questions and complaints about dates behaving weird arrived minutes later 😥</p>
<p><strong>The issue?</strong> The script that updated the server's time zone was failing silently and I missed double-checking it in the staging environment. The app wasn't using an explicit time zone, so it took the server's. And the server's time zone was UTC by default, and we needed America/Mexico_City. I fixed the script and, to make sure, updated the app's default time zone to the expected one.</p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-database">Time zone of your database</h2>
<p>You can also change your database's time zone. I use AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) and the default time zone is UTC. You can update it from the parameter group of your cluster or individual instance.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-wrong-database-time-zone">The bug - Wrong database time zone</h3>
<p>Now I was doing a migration of our database. I anticipated myself by changing the database's time zone to America/Mexico_City because the app and server had it. Every part of the system should be in the same page, right? <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>
<p>The database was perfectly okay being in UTC while the app and server were in America/Mexico_City. That's how it worked. </p>
<p>This bug was not as critical as the previous ones because I caught it in our staging environment. </p>

<h2 id="time-zone-of-your-users">Time zone of your users</h2>
<p>If it wasn't enough, each one of your users can have a different time zone, and you have to take that into consideration when showing time sensitive-data.</p>
<h3 id="the-bug-many-of-them">The bug - Many of them!</h3>
<p>I've encountered many bugs related to user's time zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing time zone in date formatter.</li>
<li>Incorrect time zone selection from the user.</li>
<li>Missing DST time zone options for users to select.</li>
<li>Storing dates with time zone modifications that get parsed again when retrieved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Time zones are one of the most complicated topics you'll find while developing software. They're complex by themselves, and even more when you throw some code into the mix.</p>
<p>I hope these short stories can help you avoid my mistakes in the future 🙌🏼</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading me! 💙</strong></p>

<![CDATA[How Iranian diaspora is using old-school tech to fight internet shutdown at home]]>
            </title>

September 24, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/cat-and-mouse-censorship/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/cat-and-mouse-censorship/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>One November morning last year, Mehdi Yahyanejad listened to a voicemail in his Los Angeles office: “I’m contacting you from the city of Tehran,” said the voice. “This was the first time I’ve experienced an internet shutdown. … It feels like I’m in a prison.”</p>



<p>A few weeks earlier, Iran’s largest mobile networks and internet providers went offline. Amid weeks of growing anti-regime protests, Iranian authorities imposed <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/18/middleeast/iran-protests-explained-intl/index.html">the longest internet shutdown</a> in the country’s history, effectively cutting off external communication for over 80 million Iranians. In an unprecedented crackdown, regime forces <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/05/iran-details-released-of-304-deaths-during-protests-six-months-after-security-forces-killing-spree/">killed more than 300 protesters</a> and arrested <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/12/iran-thousands-arbitrarily-detained-and-at-risk-of-torture-in-chilling-post-protest-crackdown/">over 7,000 people</a>. When access was finally restored on November 23, nearly half the country was still unable to come online.</p>



<p>Nine months after the November blackout, Iranians still live in fear of another all-out shutdown. As authorities tighten their hold on internet access, diaspora-led companies are filling the gap for Iranians who are seeking a way to bypass censors. The circumvention tools, created largely by diaspora entrepreneurs, are becoming increasingly critical as they face a crackdown at home and the bite of American-led sanctions online.</p>



<p>On November 15, as Iranian authorities first moved to induce the digital blackout, 44-year-old Yahyanejad raced against the clock in Los Angeles to make sure that people back home had downloaded his satellite file-casting application <a href="https://www.toosheh.org/">Toosheh</a>.<em> </em>“It was a very small window,” says Yahyanejad. “Once they were fully disconnected, I wasn’t sure they’d be able to download the software.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched by Yahyanejad in 2016, the technology aggregates uncensored content, like news articles, YouTube videos, and podcasts, and sends it to Iranian homes directly via satellite TV. When Yahyanejad first began developing Toosheh in 2013, an estimated 70% of Iranian households owned a satellite dish, while around 20% had access to the internet. Even as internet access has grown, state censorship means Toosheh’s satellite technology is a much more reliable source for uncensored content. Iranians can install Toosheh’s satellite channel and receive a daily dispatch in the form of a file package of up to 8 gigabytes. Once a user downloads the app, the satellite transfers circumvent the internet entirely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanejad says Toosheh gained nearly 100,000 new Iranians users in November 2019. In the absence of an internet connection, it became the only way for many users to access news from the outside world. The voice on Toosheh’s voicemail belonged to one such user, a 34-year-old high school principal in Tehran who downloaded emergency VPN and proxy tools delivered to him through the satellite service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having navigated extensive cyber censorship for over a decade, Iranians are tech savvy and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-42612546">adept at nimbly crossing firewalls</a>, using proxies and foreign circumvention tools. “It’s a constant cat-and-mouse game,” says Fereidoon Bashar, executive director of ASL19, a Canadian organization working to help Iranians bypass internet censorship. The group often works in tandem with Yahyanejad to distribute proxy tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bashar says Iranians adapt quickly to ever-changing institutionalized control online. But the last five years of Iranian president Hassan Rouhani’s rule have seen <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/irans-president-plans-to-cut-countrys-internet-off-from-the-rest-of-the-world/">a tighter grip on internet connections</a>. Site blocking and calculated internet outages have become easier to enforce: the regime has reduced Iran’s dependence on global networks by pushing a local intranet, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendly-domestic-internet/">aim to keep online traffic</a> inside the country. With strict American sanctions that threaten hefty fines for companies interfacing with Iran, foreign tech companies limit ordinary Iranians’ ability to purchase reliable proxies <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendly-domestic-internet/">out of an abundance of caution</a>. Riddled with insecurity, the local VPN black market is not a reliable option for those trying to avoid government attention.</p>



<p>But even as internet access grew incrementally difficult over the years, no one saw the November blackout coming. “An internet shutdown was previously viewed as a kind of dystopian political campaign,” says Kaveh Azarhoosh, an internet policy researcher. In November, the worst-case scenario for Iran’s censorship suddenly became a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early days of the protest, Toosheh created a special “Protest News Package.” Every night, after aggregating content from over 200 publications, Toosheh delivered digital bundles containing clips of protests occuring in different cities: Tabriz, Qom, Shiraz, Mashhad, and others. It also contained slides about how to stay safe during a protest; crucial news coverage from banned sites, like the <em>New York Times</em>, Voice of America Persian, and Deutsche Welle; and a curated compilation of tweets from Iranian politicians. These packages weren’t just bringing news of the outside world to Iran: they kept Iranians informed about what was happening inside their own country too.</p>



<p>Yahyanejad, a physicist by training, left Iran in 1997 to pursue a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I’ve lived in Iran, and I’ve gone to school and college there,” he explains. “I know that this repressive government exists because they are able to control the flow of information.” He says he’s always had an interest in limiting their control. “I want,” he says, “to see democracy in Iran in my lifetime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2006, Yahyanejad launched a Reddit-like forum called <a href="https://www.balatarin.com/">Balatarin</a>. “Its popularity surprised me,” he says. The site posted a translated rumor about the supreme leader’s death, after he hadn’t been seen in public for two months, and was swiftly blocked by Iran shortly after. The moment was a turning point for Yahyanejad, who says, “I made a conscious decision to keep the platform open at a personal cost.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Iranian blocks on Balatarin inspired Yahyanejad to explore censorship circumvention. He launched the satellite app Toosheh in 2016. “I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWfwF8Gx6VA">went on BBC Persian’s ‘Newshour</a>,’ and as soon as I talked about it, people started downloading and testing it immediately,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanjad finds himself among a cohort of diaspora Iranians working to fight the regime’s censors. ASL19, the Canadian technology group, collaborated with him to deliver proxy tools to over half a million Iranians during November’s shutdown. ASL19’s Bashar, who left Iran in the early 2000s before <a href="https://opennet.net/blog/2013/02/after-green-movement-internet-controls-iran-2009-2012">the tumultuous Green Movement</a>, says diaspora Iranians are stepping into the field because Iranians “risk harsh conditions, imprisonment, and long sentences” if they’re caught creating circumvention tools inside the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even outside of Iran, outspoken diaspora activists like Bashar and Yahyanejad face immense risks. In June, it was reported that an Iranian activist named Ruhollah Zam was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53238000">sentenced to death </a>in Iran after creating a popular anti-government Telegram news channel that he operated while living in exile in France. The channel, with 1.4 million followers, was shut down shortly after. For Yahyanejad, who knew of Ruhollah through the diaspora community, the ordeal was a shot across the bow. “I can never go back to Iran,” Yahyanejad admits. “But I see myself as part of the movement.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yahyanejad’s work has become crucial for Iranians, even after November’s shutdown. On July 14, following news that Iran’s Supreme Court had upheld the death sentences of three young anti-regime protesters, Iranians took to banned social media sites in an unprecedented protest, with over 6 million posts under the hashtag #DontExecute. Hours after #DontExecute began trending online, digital rights organization NetBlocks <a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1283106806332620801?s=20">monitored disruptions in the network</a>. Panicked users, still reeling from November’s shutdown, speculated another block was imminent. Luckily, an all-out ban didn’t occur, but the renewed threat of one was enough to increase Toosheh’s usage by more than 50% in the days that followed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Yahyanejad, who has been actively fighting the Iranian regime’s censorship for over a decade, the past year is proof that his work is even more necessary. “Internet shutdowns are psychological tools designed to terrify populations, to convince them that they are voiceless,” he says. “Fighting shutdowns is important so that you can show people that they are not alone and that there are others.”</p>

<p>If you have too many inputs then your brain gets overwhelmed. Every piece of information you consume takes up some brain cycles.</p>

<p>If you’re not producing enough output to match your inputs then it can get clogged up in your brain. You end up with too many strands of thought. Too many lines of enquiry.</p>

<h2 id="excess-consumption-causes-anxiety">Excess consumption causes anxiety</h2>

<p>This can often be a cause of anxiety, stress and depression. Just increasing the amount you produce allows your brain to work through your anxieties.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is why mental health issues are on the rise. There are just so many inputs for our brain in the modern world that we don’t have time to process them all into coherent outputs, so that we can understand the information we’re being presented with.</p>

<h2 id="reduce-consumption">Reduce consumption</h2>

<p>Reduce the number of inputs in your daily life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stop reading the news</li>
  <li>Spend less time on social media</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of websites you visit daily</li>
  <li>Delete unused apps from your phone</li>
  <li>Eliminate unnecessary calendar appointments</li>
  <li>Spend less time watching TV series</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally stimulate your brain less.</p>

<h2 id="increase-production">Increase production</h2>

<p>Increase the number of productive outputs in your life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create something with your hands</li>
  <li>Draw or paint pictures (doesn’t matter if you’re good or not)</li>
  <li>Write more, keep a journal or a blog</li>
  <li>Increase your daily step count</li>
  <li>Explore new places</li>
  <li>Exercise regularly</li>
  <li>Cook for yourself, rather than eating out</li>
</ul>

<p>These are things that allow you to express yourself. Express the ideas in your brain. Work through the inputs in your life.</p>

<p>Not everything has to have a point, sometimes you just need to <a href="https://www.chrismytton.com/2019/09/24/do-things-for-fun/">do things for fun</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.chrismytton.com/assets/images/chelt-paint-fest-2020.jpg" alt="Cheltenham Paint Festival 2020 at Cheltenham Spa station"></p>

<h2 id="express-yourself">Express yourself</h2>

<p>It’s by expressing the ideas in your brain that you can actually think clearly. Because the more you express them the more you can see them. Then you can visualise the ideas. Then you can better structure and organise them and compartmentalize them.</p>

<p>Now stop consuming these words and go and produce something. Express yourself.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><h4><a href="https://staffeng.com/guides">Guides</a> / <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a></h4><div><p>We all have a finite amount of time to live, and within that mortal countdown we devote some fraction towards our work. Even for the most career-focused, your life will be filled by many things beyond work: supporting your family, children, exercise, being a mentor and a mentee, hobbies, and so the list goes on. This is the sign of a rich life, but one side-effect is that time to do your work will become increasingly scarce as you get deeper into your career.</p>
<p>If you’re continuing to advance in your career, then even as your time available for work shrinks, the expectations around your impact will keep growing. For a while you can try sleeping less or depriving yourself of the non-work activities you need to feel whole, but you’ll inevitably find that your work maintains an aloof indifference to your sacrifice rather than rewarding it. Only through <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">pacing your career to your life</a> can you sustain yourself for the long-term.</p>
<p>Indeed, pacing yourself becomes the central challenge of a sustained, successful career: increasingly senior roles require that you accomplish more and more, and do it in less and less time. The ledge between these two constraints gets narrower the further you go, but it remains walkable if you take a deliberate approach.</p>
<p>First a discussion on a few common ways to get tripped up: <em>snacking</em>, <em>preening</em>, and <em>chasing ghosts</em>. Then we’ll get into the good stuff: how <em>do</em> you work on what really matters?</p>
<h2>Avoid snacking</h2>
<p>Hunter Walk recommends that folks <a href="https://hunterwalk.com/2016/06/18/the-best-startups-resists-snacks-im-not-talking-about-food/">avoid “snacking”</a> when they prioritize work. If you’re in a well-run organization, at some point you’re going to run out of things that are both high-impact and easy. This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice--easy and low-impact--is what Walk refers to as <em>snacking</em>.</p>
<p>When you’re busy, these snacks give a sense of accomplishment that makes them psychologically rewarding but you’re unlikely to learn much from doing them, others are likely equally capable of completing them (<em>and</em> for some of them it might be a good development opportunity), and there’s a tremendous opportunity cost versus doing something higher impact.</p>
<p>It’s ok to spend some of your time on snacks to keep yourself motivated between bigger accomplishments, but you have to keep yourself honest about how much time you’re spending on high-impact work versus low-impact work. In senior roles, you’re more likely to self-determine your work and if you’re not deliberately tracking your work, it’s easy to catch yourself doing little to no high-impact work.</p>
<h2>Stop preening</h2>
<p>Where “snacking” is the broad category of doing easy and low-impact work, there’s a particularly seductive subset of snacking that I call “preening.” Preening is doing low-impact, high-visibility work. Many companies conflate high-visibility and high-impact so strongly that they can’t distinguish between preening and impact, which is why it’s not uncommon to see some companies’ senior-most engineers spend the majority of their time doing work of dubious value but that is frequently recognized in company meetings.</p>
<p>If you’re taking a short-term look at <a href="https://yenkel.dev/posts/how-to-achieve-career-growth-opportunities-skills-sponsors">career growth</a>, then optimizing for your current organization’s pathologies in evaluating impact is the optimal path: go forth and preen gloriously. However, if you’re thinking about developing yourself to succeed as your <a href="https://lethain.com/growing-with-your-company/">current role grows in complexity</a> or across multiple organizations, then it’s far more important to strike a balance between valued work and self-growth.</p>
<p>This is also an important factor to consider when choosing a company to work at! Dig into what a company values and ensure it aligns with your intended personal growth. If a company’s leadership is entirely folks who focus their energy on performant urgency or acts of fealty, don’t be surprised when your success in the company depends on those activities.</p>
<p>Worse, to be a successful preener requires a near invulnerability to criticism of your actual impact, and your true work <em>will</em> suffer if your energy is diverted to preening. Typically this means you need to be a vanity hire of a senior leader or to present yourself in the way a company believes leaders look and act. If that isn’t you, then your attempt to exchange your good judgement for company success will end up failing anyway: you’ll get held accountable for the lack of true impact where others who match the company’s expectation of how a leader appears will somehow slip upward.</p>
<h2>Stop chasing ghosts</h2>
<p>Many folks would assume that companies, rational optimizers that they are, avoid spending much time on low-impact high-effort projects. Unfortunately that isn’t consistently the case. It’s surprisingly common for a new senior leader to join a company and immediately drive <a href="https://lethain.com/grand-migration/">a strategy shift that fundamentally misunderstands the challenges at hand</a>. The ghosts of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential.</p>
<p>As a senior leader, you have to maintain a hold on your ego to avoid investing into meaningless work at a grand scale. This can be surprisingly challenging when during your hiring process you’ve been repeatedly told that you’ve been hired to fix something deeply broken -- you’re the newly-hired savior, of course your instincts are right! Taking the time to understand the status quo before shifting it will always repay diligence with results.</p>
<p>I had a recent discussion with someone who argued that new senior leaders <em>deliberately</em> push for major changes even though they suspect the efforts will fail. Such changes make the organization increasingly dependent on the new leader, and also ensures anything that <em>does</em> go well gets attributed to the new leader directly rather than their team. If this is your approach to leadership, please know that you’re awful and take the time to work on yourself until the well-being and success of an entire company matters to you more than being perceived as essential.</p>
<h2>Existential issues</h2>
<p>Now that you’re done snacking, preening and chasing ghosts, the first place to look for work that matters is exploring whether your company is experiencing an existential risk. Companies operate in an eternal <a href="https://lethain.com/iterative-elimination-tournaments/">iterative elimination tournament</a>, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present. If you’re about to lose one of those rounds, then always focus there.</p>
<p>Running out of money, <a href="https://lethain.com/digg-v4/">like my experience at Digg</a>, can be the most obvious issue, but not every existential issue is financial, like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/">Twitter’s fail whale stability challenges</a> or adapting to the shifts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>If something dire is happening at your company, then that’s the place to be engaged. Nothing else will matter if it doesn’t get addressed.</p>
<h2>Work where there’s room <em>and</em> attention</h2>
<p>Existential issues are usually <em>not</em> the most efficient place to add your efforts, but efficiency isn’t a priority when the walls are crashing down around you. You <em>should</em> swarm to existential problems, but if a problem isn’t existential then you should be skeptical of adding your efforts where everyone’s already focused. Folks often chase leadership’s top priority, but with so many folks looking to make their impact there, it’s often challenging to have a meaningful impact.</p>
<p>Instead, the most effective places to work are those that matter to your company but still have enough room to actually do work. What are priorities that will become critical in the future, where you can do great work ahead of time? Where are areas that are doing <em>ok</em> but could be doing <em>great</em> with your support?</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ll find work that’s <em>worthy</em> of attention, but which an organization is incapable of paying attention to, usually because its leadership doesn’t value that work. In some companies this is developer tooling work, in others it’s inclusion work, and in most companies it’s <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">glue work</a>.</p>
<p>There is almost always a great deal of room to do this sort of work that no one is paying attention to, so you’ll be able to make rapid initial progress on it, which <em>feels</em> like a good opportunity to invest. At some point, though, you’ll find that the work needs support, and it’s quite challenging to get support for work that a company is built to ignore or devalue. Your early wins will slowly get eroded by indifference and misalignment, and your initial impact will be reclaimed by the sands of time.</p>
<p>Does this mean you shouldn’t do inclusion work? No, that’s not the conclusion I want you to take away from this. Sometimes an area that an organization doesn’t pay attention to is so important that you’re going to want to advocate for it to start paying attention. Teaching a company to value something it doesn’t care about is considerably the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less. As a senior leader, you have an ethical obligation that goes beyond maximizing your company-perceived impact, but it’s important to recognize what you’re up against and time your efforts accordingly.</p>
<h2>Foster growth</h2>
<p>One area that’s often underinvested in (e.g. lots of room to work in) while also being highly leveraged is growing the team around you. <em>Hiring</em> has a lot of folks involved in it, usually in terms of optimizing the <a href="https://lethain.com/hiring-funnel/">hiring funnel</a>, but onboarding, mentoring and coaching are wholly neglected at many companies despite being <em>at least</em> <a href="https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/">as impactful as hiring to your company’s engineering velocity</a>.</p>
<p>If you start dedicating even a couple hours a week to developing the team around you, it’s quite likely that will become your legacy long after your tech specs and pull requests are forgotten.</p>
<h2>Edit</h2>
<p>A surprising number of projects are one small change away from succeeding, one quick modification that unlocks a new opportunity, or one conversation away from consensus. I think of making those small changes, quick modifications and short conversations as <em>editing</em> your team’s …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p><em>On September 15, 2020, a small group of people worked through the night to rescue over 9.6MM USD from a vulnerable smart contract. This is our story.</em></p><p>I was about to wrap up for the night when I decided to take another look at some smart contracts.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting anything interesting, of course. Over the past few weeks I had seen countless yield farming clones launch with the exact same pitch: stake your tokens with us and you could be the next cryptocurrency millionaire. Most were simply forks of well-audited code although some tweaked bits and pieces, sometimes with catastrophic results.</p><p>But amidst all of the noise there was some code I hadn’t seen before. The contract held over 25,000 Ether, worth over 9,600,000 USD at the time, and would be a very juicy payday for anyone who managed to find a bug in its logic.</p><p>I quickly looked through the code for where Ether is transferred out and found two hits. One of them transferred the Ether to a hardcoded token address, so that could be ignored. The second was a burn function that transferred Ether to the sender. After tracing the usage of this function, I discovered that it would be trivial for anyone to mint tokens to themselves for free, but then burn them in exchange for all of the Ether in the contract. My heart jumped. Suddenly, things had become serious.</p><p>Some digging revealed that the contract I had found was part of <a href="https://lien.finance/">Lien Finance</a>’s protocol. Unfortunately, their team was anonymous! The only IM platform they supported was Telegram, and I couldn’t be sure that the admins of that channel were actually protocol developers or just a few early supporters. The last thing I wanted to do was accidentally leak the exploit to the wrong person.</p><p>After browsing their website a little while longer, I noticed that they had worked with ConsenSys Diligence and CertiK for an audit. This seemed like a good avenue, since both ConsenSys and CertiK must have interacted with the developers during their audits. I quickly pinged <a href="https://twitter.com/maurelian_">maurelian</a> on Telegram.</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>You never want to be on the receiving end of this message</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, time ticked on, my heart kept pounding, but there was no response from maurelian. It seemed like he had already gone to sleep. Desperate, I sent a message to the ETHSecurity Telegram channel.</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Artist's rendering of the message, since I deleted the original</figcaption></figure><p>Within minutes, I got a message from someone I’d worked with quite a few times in the past - <a href="https://twitter.com/wadealexc">Alex Wade</a>.</p><hr><p>My head had just hit the pillow when I got a knock on my door. It was my roommate: “Sam’s in the ETHSec Telegram asking for anyone from Diligence.”</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>It was, in fact, a long night</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing Sam, this couldn’t be good. I found a channel we’d set up with Lien a few months ago and an email address. Better than nothing, given their team was anon.</p><p>I was still half asleep. Sam, not wanting to commit details to text, asked for a Zoom call. Groggily wishing I was back in bed, I attempted to gauge the severity of the situation:</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png" alt=""><figcaption>Five minutes later, it was clear that the situation called for coffee</figcaption></figure><p>Sam and I reviewed the code together. By this point, Sam had already prepared a sample exploit and was able to confirm the issue on his machine. The conversation quickly turned to discussing options:</p><ol><li>Attempt to exploit the issue ourselves.</li><li>Reach out to Lien and have them go public, urging users to withdraw.</li></ol><p>Neither of these were appealing options. The first was risky because, as discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff">Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/danrobinson">Dan Robinson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gakonst/">Georgios Konstantopoulos</a>, the possibility of our transactions getting frontrun was very real. The second option was similarly risky, as a public announcement would draw attention to the problem and create a window of opportunity for attackers. We needed a third option.</p><p>Recalling a section from <em>Ethereum is a Dark Forest</em>, Sam reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/epheph">Scott Bigelow</a>:</p><blockquote>If you find yourself in a situation like this, we suggest you reach out to Scott Bigelow, a security researcher who has been studying this topic and has a prototype implementation for a better obfuscator.</blockquote><hr><p>After participating in the recovery attempt from <em>Ethereum is a Dark Forest, </em>which ultimately lost to front-runners, I was hungry for a re-match. I’ve spent time monitoring front-running and designing a simple system that seemed able to fool generalized front-runners, at least for the $200 I’d been able to test it with. When Sam reached out to me in the late evening with the innocent-sounding “mind staying up for another hour or so”, I couldn’t wait to try it out! I was already working it out: how I’d make a few tweaks, stay up a couple hours, feel a sense of accomplishment having helped rescue and return a few thousand dollars of user funds, and get a good night’s sleep.</p><p>Those plans immediately fell apart when Sam shared the contract with me: ~25,000 ETH, valued at $9.6M, at stake. For as much as I wanted that rematch, $9.6M was way outside my humble script’s weight class.</p><p><br>For the past few months, I had been trying to establish contacts with miners for this very purpose: white-hat transaction cooperation. If ever there was a time to appeal to a miner to include a transaction without giving front-runners the chance to steal it, it was now. Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/tzhen">Tina</a> and I have worked together over the past few months on establishing this cooperation. It seemed like a slim chance at the time, but it was worth a shot: let’s bring Tina into the rescue attempt to work with a mining pool to mine a private transaction.</p><hr><p>I had just evacuated from the Bobcat forest fire and was sipping on unknown beachy drinks zoning out to the monotonic sound of dark Pacific waves, when a Telegram DM from Sam buzzed me back to a darker reality: “funds at risk, frontrunnable”. Over the last few weeks, I had been collaborating with Sam and Scott on a research project on MEV and could already guess their ask before they sent it: a direct channel to shield a whitehat tx from getting sniped by the “advanced predators” in the mempool’s “dark forest”.</p><p>Since this was a risky move that entailed exposing our strategy to miners, we decided we should first try to get the greenlight from the anonymous Lien team. While Alex was trying to get in contact via ConsenSys-internal channels, we tried to loop in CertiK as well.</p><p>I realized it may take another 4 hours before Certik's US-based auditors would wake up, yet the clock was ticking. &nbsp;Knowing nothing much about CertiK beyond the fact it had serviced quite a few Asian projects, I tried to reach the CertiK China team to arbitrage the time zone difference. I blasted a casual sounding message in “DeFi the World” and “Yellow Hats” WeChat groups. Four leads slid into my DMs independently within 30 minutes, confirming the WeChat ID that I connected with was indeed the real Zhaozhong Ni, CTO of CertiK. I was added to a WeChat group with 5 CertiK team members, yet at this point I was still not in a position to disclose the project nor the vulnerability. To minimize the exposure and potential liability, we could only invite one member from Certik to join our whitehat operation. After passing a final verification via official email, Georgios Delkos, the engineering lead at CertiK joined our call.</p><p>With Georgios’s help, Alex was able to quickly get in contact with the Lien team and verify their identity. We brought them up-to-speed on the current situation and asked for their permission to try working directly with a mining pool to rescue the vulnerable funds. After some deliberation, the Lien team agreed that the risk from trying to rescue the funds directly or publishing a warning was too high, and gave the go-ahead to continue.</p><p>Now we needed to identify a mining pool that had the infrastructure ready in place and would be willing to cooperate with us ASAP. Which mining pool should we tap? Which contact from the pool would be in a position to make technical decisions swiftly that help us beat the clock?</p><p>SparkPool came to mind, as I knew they had been working on a piece of public infrastructure called Taichi Network that could easily offer what we needed. I decided to ping Shaoping Zhang, SparkPool’s co-founder, who had helped me investigate mempool events in the past.</p><p>Half an hour later, Shaoping responded: “You mean do we have a whitelist service for transactions? Sorry, we don’t.” Oops, something was lost in translation, “whitehat” and “whitelist” sounded similar in Chinese.</p><p>“There’s 10mn dollar worth of funds at risk. samczsun is on the line.” I tried again to communicate the situation without revealing any specifics.</p><figure><img src="https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png" alt="" srcset="https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 600w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1000w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1600w, https://samczsun.com/content/images/2020/09/photo5145442418169063579.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>“Are you guys saving the world again? Do you need help from our mining pool?” To my surprise and great relief, Shaoping jokingly extended an offer to help. After official email verification, Shaoping popped into our marathon Zoom call with the support of a roomful of SparkPool devs.</p><hr><p>After lunch, just when I was about to take a nap, I received a message from Tina: “Has SparkPool ever helped with whitehat transactions??” I mistook it for whitelisting a transaction at first. No whitehats had approached us before, and we were not familiar with what “whitehat transactions” entailed. After Tina explained it in more details, I realized that what they needed was a private transaction service, i.e. the whitehats wanted to send transactions to save a DeFi contract, but in order to prevent getting front-runned, they needed a mining pool to include the transaction without broadcasting it.</p><p>We had been working on a “private transaction” feature on our Taichi Network, which was still under development and had not been tested. I brought the whitehats’ request to our development team, and explained the urgency: our private transaction feature needed to be in production within a few hours. Our devs said they could try their best to finish in time, and we immediately got to work. We finished development of the private transaction feature in 2 hours, and then spent some time fixing bugs.</p><p>After we completed our internal testing, we sent the <em>whitehat.taichi.network</em> endpoint to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Just a short one today:
New users of Julia coming from other dynamically typed languages might write functions like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>function</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>x</span> <span>isa</span> <span>Int</span>
        <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>elseif</span> <span>x</span> <span>isa</span> <span>Float64</span>
        <span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span>
    <span>elseif</span> <span>x</span> <span>isa</span> <span>String</span>
        <span>length</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span>
        <span>1</span>
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is clearly unidiomatic and should be written as</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Int</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>Float64</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>/</span> <span>2.0</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>length</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
<span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span> <span># or bar(x::Any), to be explicit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>because it is nicer to read and very easy to extend for other types of <code>x</code>.
Well, you technically can extend <code>foo</code> the same way as <code>bar</code>, but reading the definition of <code>foo</code> one would expect to then know its complete behavior, so it would be misleading.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, my point is that there is actually (maybe surprisingly) no harm at runtime for code as in <code>foo</code>!
The Julia compiler isn’t tricked that easily and will still produce optimal machine code for each type of the argument:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>@code_native</span> <span>debuginfo</span><span>=:</span><span>none</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>text</span>
    <span>leaq</span>	<span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>),</span> <span>%</span><span>rax</span>
    <span>retq</span>
    <span>nopw</span>	<span>%</span><span>cs</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>)</span>

<span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>@code_native</span> <span>debuginfo</span><span>=:</span><span>none</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>text</span>
    <span>leaq</span>	<span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rdi</span><span>),</span> <span>%</span><span>rax</span>
    <span>retq</span>
    <span>nopw</span>	<span>%</span><span>cs</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span><span>%</span><span>rax</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Both functions basically compile down to a single adding instruction (<code>leaq</code>; <code>retq</code> is for returning from the function and <code>nopw</code> is an operation that does nothing and is there for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_%28code%29%23Machine_language_instructions">technical reasons</a>).
Think about it this way:
When Julia compiles <code>foo(1)</code>, it knows that <code>1</code> is of type <code>Int</code>, can evaluate the <code>x isa Int</code> expression at compile time to <code>true</code>, and discard everything but the <code>x + x</code> without a problem.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">“Appendix”</h2>
<p>For completeness, here is what’s produced in the other cases:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="julia"><span>julia</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>@code_native</span> <span>debuginfo</span><span>=:</span><span>none</span> <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>1.0</span><span>)</span>

            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-5/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. This time I want to take a break
from compiling and finally add a <em>reader</em>. I’m finally getting frustrated
manually entering increasinly complicated ASTs, so I figure it is time. After
this post, we’ll be able to type in programs like:</p>



<p>and have our compiler make ASTs for us! Magic. This will also add some nice
debugging tools for us. For example, imagine an interactive command line
utility in which we can enter Lisp expressions and the compiler prints out
human-readable assembly (and hex? maybe?). It could even run the code, too.
Check out this imaginary demo:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lisp&gt; 1
; mov rax, 0x4
=&gt; 1
lisp&gt; (add1 1)
; mov rax, 0x4
; add rax, 0x4
=&gt; 2
lisp&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wow, what a thought.</p>

<h3 id="the-reader-interface">The Reader interface</h3>

<p>To make this interface as simple and testable as possible, I want the reader
interface to take in a C string and return an <code>ASTNode *</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>Reader_read</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can add interfaces later to support reading from a <code>FILE*</code> or file
descriptor or something, but for now we’ll just use strings and line-based
input.</p>

<p>On success, we’ll return a fully-formed <code>ASTNode*</code>. But on error, well, hold
on. We can’t just return <code>NULL</code>. On many platforms, <code>NULL</code> is defined to be
<code>0</code>, which is how we encode the integer <code>0</code>. On others, it could be defined to
be <code>0x55555555</code><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> or something equally silly. Regardless, its value might
overlap with our type encoding scheme in some unintended way.</p>

<p>This means that we have to go ahead and add another immediate object: an
<code>Error</code> object. We have some open immediate tag bits, so sure, why not. We can
also use this to signal runtime errors and other fun things. It’ll probably be
useful.</p>

<h3 id="the-error-object">The Error object</h3>

<p>Back to the object tag diagram. Below I have reproduced the tag diagram from
previous posts, but now with a new entry (denoted by <code>&lt;-</code>). This new entry
shows the encoding for the canonical <code>Error</code> object.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>High							     Low
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX00  Integer
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000XXXXXXX00001111  Character
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000X0011111  Boolean
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101111  Nil
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111  Error &lt;-
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX001  Pair
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX010  Vector
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX011  String
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX101  Symbol
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX110  Closure
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we wanted to, we could even add additional tag bits to the (currently all 0)
payload, to signal different kinds of errors. Maybe later. For now, we add a
tag constant and associated <code>Object</code> and <code>AST</code> functions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>kErrorTag</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x3f</span><span>;</span> <span>// 0b111111</span>
<span>uword</span> <span>Object_error</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>kErrorTag</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>bool</span> <span>AST_is_error</span><span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>uword</span><span>)</span><span>node</span> <span>==</span> <span>Object_error</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
<span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>AST_error</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>Object_error</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That should be enough to get us going for now. Perhaps we could even convert
our <code>Compile_</code> suite of functions to use this object instead of an <code>int</code>. It
would certainly be more informative. Maybe in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="language-syntax">Language syntax</h3>

<p>Let’s get back to business and think about what we want our language to look
like. This is a Lisp series but really you could adapt your reader to read any
sort of syntax. No need for parentheses if you’re allergic.</p>

<p>I’m going to use this simple Lisp reader because it’s short and simple, so
we’ll have some parens.</p>

<p>First, our integers will look like integers in most languages — <code>0</code>, <code>123</code>,
<code>-123</code>.</p>

<p>You can add support for other bases if you like, but I don’t plan on it here.</p>

<p>Second, our characters will look like C characters — <code>'a'</code>, <code>'b'</code>, etc. Some
implementations opt for <code>#'a</code> but that has always looked funky to me.</p>

<p>Third, our booleans will be <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>. You’re also welcome to go ahead and
use symbols to represent the names, avoid special syntax, and have those
symbols evaluate to truthy and falsey values.</p>

<p>Fourth, the nil object will be <code>()</code>. We can also later bind the symbol <code>nil</code> to
mean <code>()</code>, too.</p>

<p>I’m going to skip error objects, because they don’t yet have any sort of
user-land meaning yet — they’re just used in compiler infrastructure right
now.</p>

<p>Fifth, pairs will look like <code>(1 2 3)</code>, meaning <code>(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3
nil)))</code>. I don’t plan on adding support for dotted pair syntax. Whitespace will
be insignificant.</p>

<p>Sixth, symbols will look like any old ASCII identifier: <code>hello</code>, <code>world</code>,
<code>fooBar</code>. I’ll also include some punctuation in there, too, so we can use <code>+</code>
and <code>-</code> as symbols, for example. Or we could even go full Lisp and use
<code>train-case</code> identifiers.</p>

<p>I’m going to skip closures, since they don’t have a syntactic representation
— they are just objects known to the runtime. Vectors and strings don’t have
any implementation right now so we’ll add those to the reader later.</p>

<p>That’s it! Key points are: mind your plus and minus signs since they can appear
in both integers and symbols; don’t read off the end; have fun.</p>

<h3 id="the-reader-implementation">The Reader implementation</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve rather informally specified what our language looks like, we can
write a small reader. We’ll start with the <code>Reader_read</code> function from above.</p>

<p>This function will just be a shell around an internal function with some more
parameters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>Reader_read</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>read_rec</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because we need to carry around some more state to read through this
string. We need to know how far into the string we are. I chose to use an
additional <code>word</code> for the index. Some might prefer a <code>char**</code> instead. Up to
you.</p>

<p>With any recursive reader invocation, we should advance through all the
whitespace, because it doesn’t mean anything to us. For this reason, we have a
handy-dandy <code>skip_whitespace</code> function that reads through all the whitespace
and then returns the next non-whitespace character.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>++*</span><span>pos</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>char</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>char</span> <span>skip_whitespace</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span> <span>isspace</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>pos</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can use <code>skip_whitespace</code> in the <code>read_rec</code> function to fetch the next
non-whitespace character. Then we’ll use that character (and sometimes the
following one, too) to determine what structure we’re about to read.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>starts_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_error</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that I put the integer cases above the symbol case because we want to
catch <code>-123</code> as an integer instead of a symbol, and <code>-a123</code> as a symbol instead
of an integer.</p>

<p>We’ll probably add more entries to <code>starts_symbol</code> later, but those should
cover the names we’ve used so far.</p>

<p>For each type of subcase (integer, symbol, list), the basic idea is the same:
while we’re still inside the subcase, add on to it.</p>

<p>For integers, this means multiplying and adding (concatenating digits, so to
speak):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>read_integer</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>sign</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span> <span>isdigit</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>next</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>pos</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>c</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_new_integer</span><span>(</span><span>sign</span> <span>*</span> <span>result</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It also takes a sign parameter so if we see an explicit <code>-</code>, we can negate the
integer.</p>

<p>For symbols, this means reading characters into a C string buffer:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>word</span> <span>ATOM_MAX</span> <span>=</span> <span>32</span><span>;</span>

<span>bool</span> <span>is_symbol_char</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>starts_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isdigit</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>

    <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>buf</span><span>[</span><span>length</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>'\0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_new_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, I avoided dynamic resizing. We only get at most symbols
of size 32. Oh well.</p>

<p>Note that symbols can also have trailing numbers in them, just not at the front
— like <code>add1</code>.</p>

<p>For characters, we only have three potential input characters to look at:
quote, char, quote. No need for a loop:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>read_char</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>char</span> <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>];</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>c</span> <span>==</span> <span>'\''</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>AST_error</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>input</span><span>[</span><span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>]</span> <span>!=</span> <span>'\''</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>AST_error</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>advance</span><span>(</span><span>pos</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>AST_new_char</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that input like <code>''</code> or <code>'aa'</code> will be an error.</p>

<p>For booleans, we can tackle those inline because there’s only two cases and
they’re both trivial. Check for <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>. Done.</p>

<p>And last, for lists, it means we recursively build up pairs until we get to
<code>nil</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>read_list</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>input</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>*</span><span>pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Names are fundamental to human existence and how we relate to everything in the world. At the heart of all interactions lies the ability for all the parties to match names to the respective entities they stand for.</p>

<p>Names are so integral to the human experience that a strong argument can be made that if <em>something doesnâ€™t have a name, it does not exist.</em></p>

<p>Correspondingly, names on the internet are critical to our online existence. Users, apps, or machines locate a resource on the internet via its name. The name needs to not only be understood by humans but also needs to be uniquely identifiable by machines amongst the billions of potential destinations.</p>

<p>Given that the act of matching a name to the eventual resource is the starting point of trillions of internet transactions that happen daily,  it is no surprise that out of the three core layers of internet stack - naming (DNS), transportation (TCP/IP) and application (HTTP), naming is at the very start of the stack.</p>

<p>Naming needs a single source of truth as the names within the namespaces have to be unique across the whole system. Hence, an effective naming system cannot merely be a standard or a protocol, it has to meet all the other aspects of running an internet-scale namespace - including enforcement of unique names, the management of the naming records, scaling to internet traffic, while remaining fully accessible to anyone, anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>

<p>Names are the most valuable assets on the internet, but we donâ€™t own our own names. All of the crucial namespaces belong to centralized entities who control the namespaces and take that control away from you. This is true for all significant namespaces today - the ICANN namespace, Facebook, Twitter, and Google.</p>

<p>As a result, your name on the internet does not belong to you, but rather to the owners of these centralized namespaces.  With a stroke of the keyboard, they can remove anyone from existence.  If your name lives on a centralized namespace, your right to exist effectively belongs to someone else.</p>

<p>Centralized namespaces also determine much more than a userâ€™s ability to exist. They also decree a userâ€™s ability to search, match, and communicate with others. They unilaterally set the framework for what protocols can be used, which use cases are permitted, and what information can flow.</p>

<p>The power to enforce monopolies with little consequence also makes these centralized namespaces some of the most valuable properties on the internet today. Verisign makes billions a year controlling .com with practically zero innovation, while ICANN has the power to arbitrarily raise price caps of entire TLDs with their pet cartel companies. Facebook and Twitter controls exactly how users can use their names/accounts, and can heedlessly cancel pages and remove identities for barely specified reasons.</p>

<p>Everywhere we see, we are seeing the serious dangers of depending on centralized entities to exist and be found by others. The Internet is supposed to be kingless, but the ability to strike away oneâ€™s existence and control exactly how the name is to be used makes the owners of these namespaces the de-facto kings/governors of the internet.</p>

<h2 id="the-world-needs-a-decentralized-namespace">The World Needs a Decentralized Namespace</h2>

<p>Of course, the ability of these centralized namespace owners to control digital existence, lockout access, and enforce monopolistic economics is the complete opposite goal of the decentralized web, which is the ability to exist, innovate, and create their own business models without the need for centralized control or systems.</p>

<p>Whether itâ€™s decentralized currencies, decentralized file systems, or decentralized servers - if these decentralized entities do not live on a widely used namespace, they simply do not exist to the vast majority of users on the internet.</p>

<p><em>Without a decentralized namespace widely readable by humans and resolvable by machines, it is impossible for the decentralized world to be widely adopted by users</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for a Decentralized Naming System</strong></p>

<p>Naming systems play a crucial role in discovery, connection and identification. As one of the most fundamental and long-lasting components of the internet backbone infrastructure, the bar needs to be set very high in terms of longevity, stability, and technical scalability.</p>

<p>For a decentralized naming system to become the legitimate namespace for the decentralized world, the bar is even higher. Without a centralized body in charge, the world has to trust that this naming system will exist in a stable state for a long time to come and stay relevant regardless of potential upheavals and technological progress.</p>

<p>As such, this naming systemâ€™s fundamental construction needs to have certain key technical, social, and governance requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Be truly decentralized</strong>: what is the point of a decentralized naming system if it remains controlled by a small set of people?</li>
  <li><strong>Main key focus as a naming system</strong>: naming systems need to be extremely focused and fast. Can you imagine the DNS system operating reliably if it was also designed for delivering 4K video?</li>
  <li><strong>Be as accessible yet trustless as possible</strong>: anyone should be able to access the namespace directly in a fully trustless manner without intensive resources</li>
  <li><strong>Compatible with the rest of the internet</strong>: allowing for seamless usage with the rest of the application, user, and technical stack</li>
  <li><strong>Stability and upgradability at the protocol level</strong>: allowing for innovation moving forward without disrupting regular operations</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="handshake-design">Handshake Design</h2>

<p>Given these objectives, and with the general goal of the decentralized root zone and certificate authority, Handshake is the only naming system that is fundamentally suitable to be the namespace for decentralized web.</p>

<h3 id="1-focus-as-a-naming-system">1. Focus as a Naming System</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s consider the inherent complexity of an internet-scale naming system. For reference, the naming layer (DNS), unlike the other layers of the internet stack, is the only layer that is a system and not a protocol - the key difference between the two is that a protocol cannot enforce uniqueness of names, which is essential to a functioning namespace. Itâ€™s also arguably by far the most complex layer with many competing technical, political, and economical demands.</p>

<p>As a standalone blockchain, Handshake has room to grow all on its own and govern itself without interfering with other projects or having to compete with different priorities with other use cases (like gaming or DeFi) trying to run in parallel on the same network. In addition, there are several fundamental constraints in other blockchains - for example, Bitcoin limited OP sizes and Ethereumâ€™s notoriously hard to sync blockchain.</p>

<p>If Handshake is built on another blockchain, the instability caused by these competing priorities for use cases and political interests also eliminates one of the core requirements for a decentralized naming infrastructure - which is stability. A naming infrastructure needs to be highly stable - remember - both users, hosts and developers need to be confident that the names will be around for a long time in the same format. For instance, Ethereumâ€™s sky high gas prices due to DeFi and the complex migration to ETH2 are both creating high levels of certainty around how apps will work in the future, and whether retail users will be able to have the same level of access as large ticket users.</p>

<p>Lastly, creating a native auction system is complicated and requires highly specific primitives, such as making coins unspendable for certain periods, and increases the complexity of the system if HNS is a non-native token.</p>

<h3 id="2-decentralization">2. Decentralization</h3>

<p>The other critical consideration is decentralization. <em>Remember, the goal here is to achieve a truly decentralized, uncensorable namespace independent of centralized control and policies. Anything less than will be completely redundant.</em></p>

<p>Ethereum is the most decentralized smart contract platform of date, but itâ€™s still insufficient as a base layer blockchain for a truly decentralized naming system. A system based on Ethereum either would have to be strictly immutable or engineer a governance mechanism with a single or multiple signers. For example, the ENS system on Ethereum has a 7-part multisig making it either censorable and shutting it off to any future innovations or upgrades. These mechanisms either risk shutting off future innovations or donâ€™t meet the decentralized requirement.</p>

<p>How about sidechains? Sidechains mostly rely on the main chainâ€™s security, which makes them completely subject to the same concerns above in terms of sharing priorities with the main chain. In addition, there is currently no such thing as a decentralized side-chain on Bitcoin. Counterparty is a one-way system, Liquid requires a small federated multisig, and Rootstock is currently federated waiting on Drivechain support from Bitcoin.</p>

<p>For all of PoWâ€™s issues, namely with the limited number of miners, it is built on competition which is inherently decentralized as well as clear separation of concerns between developers, users, and miners. This is in contrast to PoS which encourages stakeholders to collude and centralize, creating a largely plutocratic environment.</p>

<p>As such, true naming decentralization with the ability to upgrade is likely best achieved on a standalone PoW chain with robust hash power, a strong ecosystem, and miner confidence in the value of the blockchain.</p>

<h3 id="3-ease-of-trustless-resolution">3. Ease of Trustless Resolution</h3>

<p>Compared to other naming blockchains, _the entire Handshake stack is engineered for the use case of creating a human readable, truly decentralized, fully accessible and secure namespace. _</p>

<p>The naming data in Handshake is stored in a novel data structure called an Urkel Tree,  which was designed specifically for this purpose. The proofs are small and verify quickly, allowing name resolution to happen with very little computation.</p>

<p>Secondly, a highly unique application called HNSD written in C only handles the DNS functions of Handshake (avoiding …</p></div>

    <div>
      
      <p>by Jacob Heun &amp; Adin Schmahmann on 2020-09-24</p>

      

      

<p>In August we announced the <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/">deprecation of the SECIO security transport</a>. In this release we have disabled SECIO by default, which will have an impact on older nodes on the network. The best way to mitigate the impact of this change is to <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/recent-releases/go-ipfs-0-7/update-procedure">upgrade your IPFS nodes</a> as soon as possible! Not only will upgrading ensure you’re using the latest security transports, you’ll get access to all of the <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-07-20-dht-deep-dive/">performance improvements</a> we’ve made this year to content routing.</p>

<p>With this release you will also start seeing more Peer IDs and IPNS Keys on the network that start with <code>1</code> instead of the typical <code>Qm</code>. This is due to a switch to ed25519 keys being used by default over RSA keys, which you can read more about in the highlights below.</p>

<p>🚨 For those of you using plugins with IPFS there is a breaking change detailed below to the build process.</p>



<h2 id="secio-is-now-disabled-by-default">🔒 SECIO is now disabled by default</h2>

<p>As part of deprecating and removing support for the SECIO security transport, we have disabled it by default. TLS1.3 will remain the default security transport with fallback to Noise. You can read more about the deprecation in the blog post, <a href="https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/">https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-08-07-deprecating-secio/</a>. If you’re running Go IPFS older than 0.5 or JS IPFS older than 0.47, this may start to impact your performance on the public network, so we strongly encourage you to upgrade today!</p>

<h2 id="ed25519-keys-are-now-used-by-default">🗝️ Ed25519 keys are now used by default</h2>

<p>Previously go-ipfs generated 2048 bit RSA keys for new nodes, but it will now use ed25519 keys by default. This will not affect any existing keys, but newly created keys will be ed25519 by default. The main benefit of using ed25519 keys over RSA is that ed25519 keys have an inline public key. This means that someone only needs your PeerId to verify things you’ve signed, such as your Peer Records or in the future Signed Provider Records, which means we don’t have to worry about storing bulky RSA public keys.</p>

<h3 id="rotating-keys">Rotating keys</h3>

<p>Along with switching the default key type, we’ve added support for rotating Identity keys. If you would like to change the key type of your IPFS node, you can now do so with the rotate command. <strong>NOTE: This will affect your Peer Id, so be sure you want to do this!</strong> Your existing identity key will be backed up in the Keystore so that it can still be referenced for things like IPNS records.</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs key rotate -o my-old-key -t ed25519
</code></pre>

<h2 id="key-export-import">📦 Key export/import</h2>

<p>Speaking of backing up keys, we’ve added commands to allow you to export and import keys from the IPFS Keystore to a local .key file. This does not currently apply to the IPFS identity key, <code>self</code>, which is housed in the configuration file.</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs key gen mykey
$ ipfs key export -o mykey.key mykey # ./&lt;name&gt;.key is the default path
$ ipfs key import mykey mykey.key # on another node
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ipns-paths-now-encode-the-key-name-as-a-base36-cidv1-by-default">#️⃣ IPNS paths now encode the key name as a base36 CIDv1 by default</h2>

<p>Previously go-ipfs encoded the key names for IPNS paths as base58btc multihashes (e.g. <code>Qmabc...</code>). We now encode them as base36 encoded CIDv1s as defined in the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/peer-ids/peer-ids.md#string-representation">peerID spec</a> (e.g. <code>k51xyz...</code>) which also deals with the encoding of public keys. This is nice because it means that IPNS keys will by default be case-insensitive and that they will fit into DNS labels (e.g. <code>k51xyz...ipns.localhost</code>) and therefore that subdomain gateway redirections (e.g. from <code>localhost:8080/ipns/{key}</code> to <code>{key}.ipns.localhost</code>) will look better to users in the default case.</p>

<p>Many commands will accept a <code>--ipns-base</code> option that allows changing command outputs to use a particular encoding (i.e.  base58btc multihash, or CIDv1 encoded in any supported base):</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs key list -l --ipns-base b58mh
12D3KooWCjhz69LskTZEC5vFWs8eDpHo7kYbGzrC5EjU75BHSmVK self
$ ipfs key list -l --ipns-base base36
k51qzi5uqu5dh9ihj4p2v5sl3hxvv27ryx2w0xrsv6jmmqi91t9xp8p9kaipc2 self
</code></pre>

<h2 id="multiaddresses-now-accept-peerids-encoded-as-cidv1">📮 Multiaddresses now accept PeerIDs encoded as CIDv1</h2>

<p>In preparation for eventually changing the default PeerID representation multiaddresses can now contain strings like <code>/p2p/k51xyz...</code> in addition to the default <code>/p2p/Qmabc...</code>. There is a corresponding <code>--peerid-base</code> option to many functions that output peerIDs:</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs id --format "&lt;id&gt;" --peerid-base b58mh
12D3KooWCjhz69LskTZEC5vFWs8eDpHo7kYbGzrC5EjU75BHSmVK
$ ipfs id --format "&lt;id&gt;" --peerid-base base36
k51qzi5uqu5dh9ihj4p2v5sl3hxvv27ryx2w0xrsv6jmmqi91t9xp8p9kaipc2
</code></pre>

<h2 id="dag-stat-command">🧮 <code>dag stat</code> command</h2>

<p>Initial support has been added for the <code>ipfs dag stat</code> command. Running this command will traverse the DAG for the given root CID and report statistics. By default, progress will be shown as the DAG is traversed. Supported statistics currently include DAG size and number of blocks.</p>

<pre><code>$ ipfs dag stat bafybeihpetclqvwb4qnmumvcn7nh4pxrtugrlpw4jgjpqicdxsv7opdm6e # the IPFS webui
Size: 30362191, NumBlocks: 346
</code></pre>

<h2 id="plugin-build-changes">🚨 Plugin build changes 🚨</h2>

<p>We have changed the build flags used by the official binary distributions on <a href="https://dist.ipfs.io/">dist.ipfs.io</a> (or <code>/ipns/dist.ipfs.io</code>) to use the simpler and more reliable <code>-trimpath</code> flag instead of the more complicated and brittle <code>-asmflags=all=-trimpath="$(GOPATH)" -gcflags=all=-trimpath="$(GOPATH)"</code> flags, however the build flags used by default in go-ipfs remain the same.</p>

<p>The scripts in <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-example-plugin">go-ipfs-example-plugin</a> have been updated to reflect this change. This is a <strong>breaking change</strong> to how people have been building plugins against the dist.ipfs.io binary of go-ipfs and plugins should update their build processes accordingly. See <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-example-plugin/pull/9">go-ipfs-example-plugin/pull/9</a> for details.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://welearncode.com/">← Home</a></p><p>When I think about who I would like to work with as a programmer, I think so much more about non-technical skills than technical skills that make somebody a good co-worker. In fact, all of the skills that are in this post contribute to writing good code that improves technical projects. Most of them are really helpful for careers outside of programming too, but I'm going to focus on why they're useful for programmers specifically.</p><h2>Empathy</h2><p>To build a great product, you must put yourself in the shoes of your users. How will they be using your product? What features will be helpful for them? How can your program help them or improve their lives? And -- conversely -- how could it harm them or negatively impact their lives? What are the ethical implications of your application?</p><p>Empathy is essential for so many pieces of your programs -- if they aren't secure then your user's information could be used negatively by a third party. If they aren't accessible, then you are limiting the number of people that can use your project. If they run slowly or needs huge amounts of bandwidth to run, then users will leave and people in areas with slow internet or mobile users won't be able to run them. It seems like every day an article comes out with some harmful algorithm a company has implemented, like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/18/report-youtubes-alternative-influence-network-breeds-rightwing-radicalisation">YouTube algorithm radicalizing the alt-right</a>, <a href="https://www.inc.com/guadalupe-gonzalez/amazon-artificial-intelligence-ai-hiring-tool-hr.html">Amazon creating a sexist hiring algorithm (which they didn't end up using)</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxuyfWoVV98">AI misgendering black women</a>. Think about everybody when you are writing your code!</p><p>Also, empathy is helpful for being a team member and a mentor. Put yourself in your manager or another developer's shoes. Why are they making their decisions? What can you do to help them? Having empathy will definitely improve your ability to be an effective teammate. If you're an employer, you can retain your employees for longer, and they will be more effective workers if you display empathy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhigginbottom/2018/05/31/why-empathy-matters-in-the-workplace/#386ca65d1130">(src)</a>.</p><p>Have patience for other programmers, especially ones that are learning new things. Remind yourself of something that was really hard for you to learn and how that felt. They probably feel similarly. Being rude to them, diminishing their progress, or being pedantic will only be harmful and make that process harder for them.</p><p><strong>Your words and actions have real consequences -- you can use that to enact positive change or hurt somebody. That doesn't end with in-person communication -- online communication counts too. You may think you're being funny or just letting off steam, but you may actually causing a very negative impact on someone's life. It's up to you to decide how to act, and how to apologize if you hurt someone to undo some of that harm.</strong></p><h2>Problem Solving</h2><p>When I teach people to code, I see a lot more people struggling with problem-solving than the code itself. The ability to break a problem into smaller ones and then solve all of those smaller problems takes a lot of practice. Getting good at problem-solving can help you become a much stronger programmer.</p><p>Also, for most problems, there will be more than one solution. A large part of our jobs as software developers is to think through those different solutions and choose the one that is best. Is one faster to implement? Or does it run more efficiently? Or will it be less expensive? All of these are important questions, and picking the correct solution is a challenging but important part of software development.</p><h2>Collaboration</h2><p>Chances are very high that you with other people as a programmer. You will have to work with other developers, business people, managers, open source contributors, stakeholders, and countless other people even if you are a freelancer or entrepreneur. Learning how to work well with different people and their personalities is critical.</p><p>There are so many things that contribute to good collaboration. The first is knowing that one person can't do everything, or at least do everything well. Different people have different skills, points of view, and life experiences that are more powerful in combination than isolation. Don't feel like you always need to "put the team on your back" or be everything to everybody. You can be a lot better if you allow other people to contribute too.</p><p>Ask other people for help, and be willing to help people in return. You don't need to be an expert in everything, and different people will be experts in different things. Rely on other people, and if you are stuck on something make sure to ask for help so that you don't stay stuck for too long. When somebody asks you for help, be willing to help them. You can learn a lot by explaining things well, and you will be able to reinforce your knowledge of the topic. If you're in a management position, make sure to give people time for mentorship and effective collaboration!</p><p>Along the same lines, don't talk over people or immediately dismiss their viewpoints. They will probably be much less likely to contribute in the future if their opinions aren't valued or taken into account. Actively listen when people share their ideas -- instead of thinking about your response or why your idea is better while they are talking, try to think about why their approach is also good or how it could be implemented.</p><p>Then, once you implement their awesome ideas, give them credit for those ideas. Nothing has made me less effective as an employee as being on a team where my ideas were dismissed, under-valued, and un-credited by other people on my team.</p><h2>Communication</h2><p>When you are working with other people, whether those people are co-workers, clients, the people who use your projects, managers, or people you manage, good communication is crucial. Give honest updates on how things are going, where projects currently stand, and your opinions on things honestly but kindly. People will be less receptive to feedback if you are rude or unconstructive. But, if you are dishonest or sugar-coat the truth, then you may not see a positive change. There's definitely a fine line here.</p><p>One real life example from my life: I had somebody who read one of my blog posts write a very long letter about how dumb I sound because of the tone I take. I usually use a lot of exclamation points and try to sound exciting in my posts -- and that's very intentional to try and make topics that can be intimidating or boring more fun. The person got pretty sexist in this email and said some pretty hurtful things. That being said, I probably could scale back on the exclamation points and still get people excited about programming. I would have been a lot more receptive to that point if the person had framed the criticism more constructively.</p><p>If things are not going well, make sure to say so. Be honest about needing a deadline pushed back, or how something isn't going well at work. You will have a much better chance at changing it and making the environment better for yourself if you speak up.</p><h2>Inclusiveness</h2><p>I used to work as a rock climbing instructor and counselor at a summer camp, and the age group I worked with most were middle school girls. They were some of my favorite people I've ever worked with, but, that being said, middle schoolers aren't usually the most accepting of difference or that clique-adverse. We used to run a game where we started out in one large circle, and then one counselor would tell people they were "out of the circle", and they would have to leave the game based on some characteristic that they weren't informed of and couldn't control. The people still inside the circle would play a game, and the people outside of the circle were excluded and just had to watch from afar.</p><p>This activity was super effective in showing these girls what it was like to be left out for reasons outside of your control, and I still think back on it a lot. As adults, we still leave people out of the circle and exclude them based on certain characteristics outside their control, but if we let them back into the circle and allow them to contribute then our products draw on more diverse experiences and are better. <strong>There's <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">a lot of research</a> on more diverse teams performing better, but from an individual perspective, think about what it feels like to be left out of the circle and try to make your circle larger, not smaller.</strong> Chances are, a lot of your users may be people that have traditionally been left out of the circle in tech. I can tell you from my own experience, that it's really difficult to be the only person like you on a team as someone who's been on a team with another woman for ~5% of my programming career.</p><p>This also links into empathy -- make sure that you are making your programs for a wide variety of users. Not just the able-bodied or those with cutting-edge internet or technologies. You will be able to reach more people.</p><h2>Patience</h2><p>The first person that you need to have patience with when you are programming is yourself. <strong>Programming is hard</strong> and sometimes you will have bugs or difficult problems to overcome. If it's always easy, then you aren't challenging yourself, and you aren't growing as a programmer. Have the tenacity to keep working through a problem and not give up when it gets hard. But, also, know that you can take a break and come back to the problem in a little while. Maybe taking a break will help you solve the problem more efficiently or to see it differently when you come back to it.</p><p>Also, be patient with other people. Things can take a while to learn and people are not perfect. Making mistakes and failing can be some of the most important experiences in the learning process, so allow for that instead of creating an environment where it isn't safe to take risks or grow. Understand that different things click more easily for different people, and know that learning can take a while.</p><h2>Creativity</h2><p>My favorite thing about being a programmer is that I get to use my creative energy to build things that other people can then benefit from. You get to think outside of the box to create really cool things.</p><p>Having creative ideas is important for coming up with …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ca2563ba93dc6cf1ddae"><div><p>Shift, manage and monitor your herd remotely - we’ve summed it up fairly concisely, but how we do that may require a little more paper and a sharpening of the pencil. How are we able to shift a cow to and from the milk shed with the click of a button? Essentially, we train cows to respond to sensory cues which help them understand where they can and cannot go, a method based on the theory of Pavlovian Conditioning. Now, it’s likely your list of questions is long, so we’ve brought in our Head of Rural, Chris, who oversees all on farm training to give you some answers.</p><p><strong>You say that you use sensory cues to guide cows… how does that work?</strong></p><p>Like any animal, cows learn behaviours through the use of positive and negative reinforcement. This technique is commonly known as Pavlovian Conditioning, whereby certain stimuli such as sounds, touches and smells are paired with a conditioned response in order to elicit a desired behaviour.</p><p>If you think about the way we farm today, farmers use a multitude of different cues to shift cows or keep them in a particular zone. To put it really simply, Halter replicates these cues and places them on a collar in the form of sound and vibration. </p><p>Vibration can be seen as a positive reinforcer, enabling us to shift cows around the farm as well as indicating to a cow that she is moving in the right direction. You might like to think of vibration as a farmer walking behind their cows to shift them up to the shed! Sound on the other hand helps a cow understand she is moving in the wrong direction or outside of the allocated zone. Currently on the farm an electric fence is the only real means available for farmers to keep their cows within a particular boundary; we instead use sound to replicate a fence line with a pulse used during the initial training period to help a cow understand the meaning of sound. Once the girls are trained we combine sound cues with vibration and we have the ability to guide cows around a farm, keep them out of waterways and set up virtual paddocks and break fences.</p><p><strong>How quick is the training process? Do all cows learn or do some just not get it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cows are extremely quick to respond to sound, within a couple hours of wearing a collar cows learn to stay within a static boundary. It takes a little longer for them to associate vibration with positive cues, however we are currently seeing this happen within a week. In general onboarding takes a week, however this process is continually being modified and improved.</p><p>To date we haven’t come across any cows that we couldn’t train! Some learn faster than others but due to the fact that cows are herd animals, the slower ones tend to follow and learn from the faster cows.</p><p><strong>How do you ensure that the training is safe and ethical?</strong></p><p>We’ve been working with animal ethics committees from the start and continue to work closely with them, along with vets and professors in this domain. Welfare is our top priority and our founding vision is to unlock the connection between animals and humans to create a better world, with the hope of not only improving the welfare of cows but other animals in the future. </p><p>We are employing a number of systems to ensure our technology is never harmful to a cow, for instance we have hardcoded mechanisms in place that will shut down a collar should anything out of the ordinary happen, for example a cow getting spooked. We have also considered the training process itself and will begin training softly until a cow becomes more comfortable. </p><p>We want to dramatically improve the welfare of cows and will never compromise their wellbeing.</p><p><strong>Will Halter work on other livestock like sheep and beef cattle? And what about calves?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. Beef cattle would be simple - it just requires a slight change in use case. Sheep would require a collar redesign to fit their small fluffy necks and, no, they are not too stupid! I am confident that the fundamental techniques will work on pretty much any mammal. Pavlovian conditioning is a concept that appeals to very basic animalistic instincts that all mammals, and most likely many other types of animals share.</p><p>In terms of calves there is no reason that Halter wouldn’t work for them, we’d just need collars small enough! Although we are currently focused on dairy cattle I see no reason why Halter wouldn’t work on other livestock in the future!</p><p>Setting up a virtual break fence, shifting cows automatically or drafting a single cow with the touch of a button sounds like a rather crazy concept, but we hope this has given you a touch of background and understanding to it all. We’ll leave you to train your dogs, but trust us when we say - we’ve got the cows covered.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <h4>Introduction to managing DB shcema changes with Liquibase</h4>
                <h6>
                    By Suresh Regmi, Published 2020-09-06
                </h6>
    </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Let me give you a scenario,<br>
You have a project with multiple database instances in different environments (Dev, QA, Production) and you need to manage the database schema changes that are done against those environments.
Let’s assume that you are managing those changes by creating a git project or a shared file on a drive and adding a new SQL file for each database changes you are doing.
To implement your changes in that database, for each SQL file, you need to run the changes in each environment manually and add a flag or note to indicate which change is run on which environment.<br>
Would it be able to complete your task?
Yes, Yet, is it a decent method to manage schema changes?<br>
Of Course Not.</p>
<h2 id="here-are-some-of-the-many-problems-you-might-face-while-doing-so">Here are some of the many problems you might face while doing so</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hard to synchronize database and application code changes in different environments</li>
<li>The tedious process to run each change manually in different environments</li>
<li>Collaboration across the development team on what change is deployed and what is not</li>
<li>Hard to roll-back to the previous version of the database</li>
<li>Possibility of data loss</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="here-comes-liquibase">Here comes Liquibase</h2>
<p>Liquibase is an open-source library for tracking and managing database schema changes that can be used for any database with a JDBC driver.<br>
It is a platform-independent database migration tool that allows the database changes referred to as ‘changesets’ to be written in various formats including XML, JSON, YAML, and SQL.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>Supports almost all databases that have a JDBC driver.</li>
<li>Changesets can be written in different formats like XML, JSON, YAML, and SQL.</li>
<li>Can be used to automatically generate changesets for an existing database</li>
<li>Easy to integrate with build tools like Jenkins, Maven etc</li>
<li>Supports database rollbacks</li>
<li>Supports context-dependent logic allowing us to use global context and preconditions</li>
<li>Can be executed via command line, Apache Maven, Apache Ant, Spring Framework</li>
<li>Has feature to generate changeset from an existing database and can also generate schema difference as changesets</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="different-ways-to-run-liquibase">Different ways to run liquibase</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embed liquibase with your app:</strong> Embedding liquibase with your application code will automatically deploy liquibase on the app startup.</li>
<li><strong>Run liquibase using build tools:</strong> Integrate liquibase into your build process (with build tools like Jenkins, Ant, Maven, and Gradle) and update them without being tied up with the application.</li>
<li><strong>Generate the SQL and run it manually:</strong> Using update SQL, Liquibase provides the SQL generated from the changeset along with the database changes required to keep the tracking tables up to date. DBA will then inspect the SQL and run them against the database.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installation-process">Installation Process</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Liquibase requires Java 8+</p>
<p>There are two ways to install Liquibase, Manual installation and using liquibase installer.</p>
<p>If you set up liquibase using the liquibase installer, dependencies, directories, config and properties files will all be in place already.
It also provides some examples which will provide you with the core concepts required to understand the changesets.</p>
<p>In the case of manual installation, you need to download the compressed liquibase file and extract it in your workspace.<br>
For windows users, you need to add a new <code>PATH</code> variable in the <code>Environment Variables</code>.<br>
For macOS users, the path should be added to the <code>bash.profile</code> file.</p>
<p>For detailed instruction on Installation please follow this <a href="https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/installation/home.html" target="_blank"> document </a>.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>liquibase.properties:</strong> The file <code>liquibase.properties</code> is a text-based file that stores common properties like database connection parameters, driver details, classpath parameters, global changelog parameters etc.
If you install liquibase using liquibase installer, it will provide pre-written <code>liquibase.properties</code> file while in case of manual installation, you need to create <code>liquibase.properties</code> file using a sample file provided.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>DatabaseChangeLog:</strong> Databasechangelog is a file where all changesets go. Each database changelog can include one or more changesets.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.turtle-techies.com/database-version-controler-with-liquibase/image02.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/database-version-controler-with-liquibase/image02.png" alt="Example of an empty DatabaseChangeLog file
"></a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Changeset:</strong> In liquibase, a changeset is represented as an atomic change to the database. Each changeset should be uniquely identified using author and id fields.
The database handles each changeset as a single transaction.
Changesets can be written in JSON, XML, SQL and YAML formats.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>DATABASECHANGELOG &amp; DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK:</strong> These two tables are created by liquibase to track the changes that are run against the database and to make sure that no other migrations age going on.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.turtle-techies.com/database-version-controler-with-liquibase/image04.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/database-version-controler-with-liquibase/image04.png" alt="DATABASECHANGELOG table structure"></a></p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-dont-like-liquibase">What if I don’t like Liquibase?</h2>
<p>If you told me that you don’t like liquibase and are looking for alternatives, I would ask why not Liquibase first.<br>
Liquibase is a sophisticated tool for database migration that has all features that you need for professional database refactoring and versioning.</p>
<p>But still, if you don’t want to use liquibase, here are some alternatives.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Flyway:</strong> Flyway is an open-source Apache licenced tool for database migration where you can write migrations in database-specific SQL or using Java code. For more details on Flyway, you can refer to this website. <a href="https://flywaydb.org/">https://flywaydb.org/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>YUNIQL:</strong> YUNIQL is also an open-source schema versioning and database migration engine that uses plain SQL scripts which can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines. If you want to check out YUNIQL, you can refer to this website. <a href="https://yuniql.io/">https://yuniql.io/</a></p>
