<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.</p></blockquote><p>Over the past year, I have skimmed through 2578 social science papers, spending about 2.5 minutes on each one. This was due to my participation in <a href="https://www.replicationmarkets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replication Markets</a>, a part of DARPA's SCORE program, whose goal is to evaluate the reliability of social science research. 3000 studies were split up into 10 rounds of ~300 studies each. Starting in August 2019, each round consisted of one week of surveys followed by two weeks of market trading. I finished in first place in 3 out 10 survey rounds and 6 out of 10 market rounds. In total, about $200,000 in prize money will be awarded.</p><p>The studies were sourced from all social sciences disciplines (economics, psychology, sociology, management, etc.) and were published between 2009 and 2018 (in other words, most of the sample came from the post-replication crisis era).</p><p>The average replication probability in the market was 54%; while the replication results are not out yet (250 of the 3000 papers will be replicated), previous experiments have shown that prediction markets work well.<span><a href="#fn19282306691" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306691">1</sup></a></span></p><p>This is what the distribution of my own predictions looks like:<span><a href="#fn19282306692" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306692">2</sup></a></span></p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_mypredsdist-67f351a8a634ca87ace22fd62155e7c5.png"></p><p>My average forecast was in line with the market. A quarter of the claims were above 76%. And a quarter of them were below 33%: we're talking hundreds upon hundreds of terrible papers, and this is just a tiny sample of the annual academic production.</p><p>Criticizing bad science from an abstract, 10000-foot view is pleasant: you hear about some stuff that doesn't replicate, some methodologies that seem a bit silly. "They should improve their methods", "p-hacking is bad", "we must change the incentives", you declare Zeuslike from your throne in the clouds, and then go on with your day.</p><p>But actually diving into the sea of trash that is social science gives you a more tangible perspective, a more visceral revulsion, and perhaps even a sense of Lovecraftian awe at the sheer magnitude of it all: a vast landfill—a great agglomeration of garbage extending as far as the eye can see, effluvious waves crashing and throwing up a foul foam of p=0.049 papers. As you walk up to the diving platform, the deformed attendant hands you a pair of flippers. Noticing your reticence, he gives a subtle nod as if to say: "come on then, jump in".</p><h2 id="They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing"><a href="#They-Know-What-They-39-re-Doing" title="They Know What They're Doing"></a>They Know What They're Doing</h2><p>Prediction markets work well because predicting replication is easy.<span><a href="#fn19282306693" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306693">3</sup></a></span> There's no need for a deep dive into the statistical methodology or a rigorous examination of the data, no need to scrutinize esoteric theories for subtle errors—these papers have obvious, surface-level problems.</p><p>There's a popular belief that weak studies are the result of unconscious biases leading researchers down a "garden of forking paths". Given enough "researcher degrees of freedom" even the most punctilious investigator can be misled.</p><p>I find this belief impossible to accept. The brain is a credulous piece of meat<span><a href="#fn19282306694" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306694">4</sup></a></span> but there are limits to self-delusion. Most of them have to know. It's understandable to be led down the garden of forking paths while producing the research, but when the paper is done and you give it a final read-over you will surely notice that all you have is a n=23, p=0.049 three-way interaction effect (one of dozens you tested, and with no multiple testing adjustments of course). At that point it takes more than a <em>subtle unconscious bias</em> to believe you have found something real. And even if the authors really are misled by the forking paths, what are the editors and reviewers doing? Are we supposed to believe they are all gullible rubes?</p><p>People within the academy don't want to rock the boat. They still have to attend the conferences, secure the grants, publish in the journals, show up at the faculty meetings: all these things depend on their peers. When criticising bad research it's easier for everyone to blame the forking paths rather than the person walking them. No need for uncomfortable unpleasantries. The fraudster can admit, without much of a hit to their reputation, that indeed they were <em>misled</em> by that <em>dastardly garden</em>, really through no fault of their own whatsoever, at which point their colleagues on twitter will applaud and say "ah, good on you, you handled this tough situation with such exquisite virtue, this is how progress happens! hip, hip, hurrah!" What a ridiculous charade.</p><p>Even when they do accuse someone of wrongdoing they use terms like "Questionable Research Practices" (QRP). How about Questionable Euphemism Practices?</p><ul><li>When they measure a dozen things and only pick their outcome variable at the end, that's not the garden of forking paths but the greenhouse of fraud.</li><li>When they do a correlational analysis but give "policy implications" as if they were doing a causal one, they're not walking around the garden, they're doing the landscaping of forking paths.</li><li>When they take a continuous variable and arbitrarily bin it to do subgroup analysis or when they add an <em>ad hoc</em> quadratic term to their regression, they're...fertilizing the garden of forking paths? (Look, there's only so many horticultural metaphors, ok?)</li></ul><p>The bottom line is this: if a random schmuck with zero domain expertise like me can predict what will replicate, <em>then so can scientists who have spent half their lives studying this stuff</em>. But they sure don't act like it.</p><h2 id="or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t"><a href="#or-Maybe-They-Don-39-t" title="...or Maybe They Don't?"></a>...or Maybe They Don't?</h2><blockquote><p>The horror! The horror!</p></blockquote><p>Check out this crazy chart from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/04/28/1909046117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yang et al. (2020)</a>:</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_citations-7d4f72c6e9582a5ba8775da70eda80e1.png"></p><p>Yes, you're reading that right: studies that replicate are cited at the same rate as studies that do not. Publishing your own weak papers is one thing, but citing other people's weak papers? This seemed implausible, so I decided to do my own analysis with a sample of 250 articles from the Replication Markets project. The correlation between citations per year and (market-estimated) probability of replication was -0.05!</p><p>You might hypothesize that the citations of non-replicating papers are negative, but negative citations are extremely rare.<span><a href="#fn19282306695" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306695">5</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study</a> puts the rate at 2.4%. Astonishingly, even <em>after retraction</em> the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18974415/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast majority of citations are positive</a>, and those positive citations <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20136577/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue for decades after retraction</a>.<span><a href="#fn19282306696" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306696">6</sup></a></span></p><p>As in all affairs of man, it once again comes down to Hanlon's Razor. Either:</p><ol><li>Malice: they know which results are likely false but cite them anyway.</li><li>or, Stupidity: they can't tell which papers will replicate even though it's quite easy.</li></ol><p>Accepting the first option would require a level of cynicism that even I struggle to muster. But the alternative doesn't seem much better: <em>how can they not know?</em> I, an idiot with no relevant credentials or knowledge, can fairly accurately determine good research from bad, but all the tenured experts can not? How can they not tell <em>which papers are retracted</em>?</p><p>I think the most plausible explanation is that scientists don't read the papers they cite, which I suppose involves both malice <em>and</em> stupidity.<span><a href="#fn19282306697" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306697">7</sup></a></span> <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Scanners#citogenesis-how-often-do-researchers-not-read-the-papers-they-cite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gwern has an write-up on this question</a> citing some ingenious analyses based on the proliferation of misprints: "Simkin &amp; Roychowdhury venture a guess that as many as 80% of authors citing a paper have not actually read the original". Once a paper is out there nobody bothers to check it, even though they know there's a 50-50 chance it's false!</p><p>Whatever the explanation might be, the fact is that the academic system does not allocate citations to true claims.<span><a href="#fn19282306698" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref19282306698">8</sup></a></span> This is bad not only for the direct effect of basing further research on false results, but also because it distorts the incentives scientists face. If nobody cited weak studies, we wouldn't have so many of them. Rewarding impact without regard for the truth inevitably leads to disaster.</p><h2 id="There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards"><a href="#There-Are-No-Journals-With-Strict-Quality-Standards" title="There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards"></a>There Are No Journals With Strict Quality Standards</h2><p>Naïvely you might expect that the top-ranking journals would be full of studies that are highly likely to replicate, and the low-ranking journals would be full of p&lt;0.1 studies based on five undergraduates. Not so! Like citations, journal status and quality are not very well correlated: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00037/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is no association between statistical power and impact factor</a>, and journals with higher impact factor <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/071530v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have more papers with erroneous p-values</a>.</p><p>This pattern is repeated in the Replication Markets data. As you can see in the chart below, there's no relationship between h-index (a measure of impact) and average expected replication rates. There's also no relationship between h-index and expected replication <em>within</em> fields.</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_journalhindex-34ca20d3877248fe6b7313c3e2d39fae.png"></p><p>Even the <em>crème de la crème</em> of economics journals barely manage a ⅔ expected replication rate. 1 in 5 articles in QJE scores below 50%, and this is a journal that accepts just 1 out of every 30 submissions. Perhaps this (partially) explains why scientists are undiscerning: journal reputation acts as a cloak for bad research. It would be fun to test this idea empirically.</p><p>Here you can see the distribution of replication estimates for every journal in the RM sample:</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_journals-cdc1139ad4faf1819b8b42db914dbe81.png"></p><p>As far as I can tell, for most journals the question of whether the results in a paper are true is a matter of secondary importance. If we model journals as wanting to maximize "impact", then this is hardly surprising: as we saw above, citation counts are unrelated to truth. If scientists were more careful about what they cited, then journals would in turn be more careful about what they publish.</p><h2 id="Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better"><a href="#Things-Are-Not-Getting-Better" title="Things Are Not Getting Better"></a>Things Are Not Getting Better</h2><p>Before we got to see any of the actual Replication Markets studies, we voted on the expected replication rates by year. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200566" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gordon et al. (2020)</a> has that data: replication rates were expected to steadily increase from 43% in 2009/2010 to 55% in 2017/2018.</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_years_pre-7012095f551422f22db31bfffda1c899.png"></p><p>This is what the average predictions looked like <em>after</em> seeing the papers: from 53.4% in 2009 to 55.8% in 2018 (difference not statistically significant; black dots are means).</p><p><img src="https://fantasticanachronism.com/images/skimmed_years-1c0573dfb59a70e36a43deb2692229bf.png"></p><p>I frequently encounter the notion that after the replication crisis hit there was some sort of great improvement in the social sciences, that people wouldn't even dream of publishing studies based on 23 undergraduates any more (I actually saw plenty of those), etc. Stuart Ritchie's new book praises …</p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>Early in my career, after a short initial interview at a consulting firm in Toronto, I was invited to a technical interview on the same day. Two of the senior developers from the team I would join would conduct the interview.</p><p>The interview started pleasantly with them describing the project they have been working on: a portal for university professors to communicate with their students. It was being built with ASP.NET MVC, a framework I had been working with for several years. I expressed that I was comfortable with the framework and I would be excited to work on the project. Then the technical examination began and on its conclusion I left the interview feeling humiliated.</p><p>Many years later, when I was preparing to take an interview, I looked back on this experience to realize that the line of questioning and approach had been an ego trip for those developers. I promised myself to <em>never</em> make any of my candidates feel the way I did.</p><p>What did those developers do wrong? Leaving aside their attitude towards me, their questions had no relevance to the role or the project. I did not know what a red-black tree was at the time but I definitely knew how to use ASP.NET MVC which they did not inquire about.</p><p>My golden rule for technical interviews is that, "Every step, conversation and question <em>must</em> be pertinent to the day-to-day of the role." While this may be obvious, I am sure that many hiring managers are still expecting candidates to arrive at technical interviews with Computer Science books memorized. This form of technical interviews should be made obsolete.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bigger button = more clicks on the CTA <a href="https://t.co/Ter7xJdNKM">pic.twitter.com/Ter7xJdNKM</a></p>— Vincent Déniel (@vincentdnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentdnl/status/1291041278264713220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>With my golden rule as guide, I conduct a much simpler interview process. Prior to an interview, my team and I review samples of code that the candidate shared with us (or had written on Github) to understand the quality of their code. And during the interview, I dive into three areas of discussions with the candidates: product building, process adherence and team work.</p><h3 id="product-building">Product Building</h3><p>I try to understand the candidate's interest and experience of building products by,</p><ol><li>Going through their past experience and asking about what technologies and products they built and how. I ask about previous products they have shipped from concept to market.</li><li>To understand their thought process for deriving solutions, I draw an UI and ask them to outline and explain what approaches, structures and technologies they would use to build it out.</li><li>I ask about how they keep up with technologies and how they improve their skills to gauge their passion for the work.</li></ol><h3 id="process-adherence">Process Adherence</h3><p>To better understand how the candidate does their work,</p><ol><li>I go over their experiences and ask about how they managed their product-building and what tools and processes they used.</li><li>I explain the process of working on our team and ask how they would change it and where they see inefficiencies to discuss their thinking.</li><li>Often, I will give them a scenario where the processes are failing the team to find what they would do to tackle inefficiencies and if they would be willing to speak up.</li></ol><h3 id="team-work">Team Work</h3><p>I also try to understand how a candidate works in a team,</p><ol><li>While going through their past experiences, I ask about how they collaborated and communicated with their teams.</li><li>I present a scenario where their knowledge in an area may be lacking and evaluate if and how they would leverage and collaborate with their team.</li><li>Another scenario I ask about is where they disagree with their team-members to evaluate how they manage conflict and focus on delivering results for the team.</li></ol><p>I do this within one interview to be mindful of the candidate's time and mine. I want to hire candidates for their will to learn, grow and challenge the status quo.</p><p>The technology landscape is such that anyone can acquire a set of baseline programming skills. What is needed then, is a willingness to challenge ourselves and stay open-minded because every developer will have to learn on the job almost all of the time. Given this, the technical interview is arcane, academic and as good as dead.</p><hr><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><ol><li><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/helpful-com/https-medium-com-fnthawar-helpful-technical-interviews-are-garbage-dc5d9aee5acd">Technical interviews are garbage.

The sound of the NBC chimes is the sound of radio history itself.  Probably no single sound better recalls 
the golden age of radio.  The NBC chimes – the musical notes G-E-C – were played at the end of every 
NBC radio program beginning shortly after the network's inception, and continued in daily use on NBC radio and television 
until 1971. </p><p>
&nbsp;Shortly after the formation of the National Broadcasting Company
in 1926, network executives became aware of confusion among the
affiliate stations as to the exact when a program ended, and when it
was safe to cut away for local announcements. The problem was assigned
to a committee of three: Oscar B. Hanson, NBC's Director of Engineer
and a former AT&amp;T engineer; Earnest la Prada, an NBC orchestra
leader; and Phillips Carlin, an NBC announcer. They decided that a
musical signal of some kind would be an appropriate way to indicate the
ending of all programs. At that time, it was common for radio stations
to use the sounds of chimes, gongs, sirens and other mechanical devices
as a signature sound for their station, so the choice of a chime by NBC
was not unusual or particularly innovative. There is in fact some
evidence that the chimes may have been inspired by a similar chime
sequence used at that time by NBC affiliate WSB in Atlanta. </p><p>

During 1927 and 1928, the committee experimented with several combinations of notes.  A seven-note 
sequence which was first used, G-C-F-E-G-C-E, was determined to be too complicated for the announcers to 
play correctly on a consistent basis.  It was first simplified to G-C-F-E, and finally to just G-E-C.  This familiar 
sequence was heard for the first time on November 29, 1929.</p><p>

The chimes were sounded at :29:30 and :59:30 of each hour, to indicate the start 
of the 30 second local station break. They were initially struck by hand by the 
announcer, using a set of hand-held chimes held up to the microphone.<span face="Times New Roman">
</span>
<span>
But, there were inconsistencies in the chimes' tempo, volume, and exact timing.&nbsp; </span>
<span face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;I</span>t was finally determined that the 
best way to solve these problems was for the chimes to be generated 
mechanically.</p><center>
<img alt="Chimes Machine Schematic" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimach.gif" height="480" width="430"><p>&nbsp;<img alt="Chimes Machine" src="http://www.theradiohistorian.org/chimes2b.jpg" height="480" width="640"></p>
<p>&gt;
</p></center>

The man who designed the chimes machine was 
Captain Richard H. Ranger, who was also the inventor of the electronic organ and the RCA facsimile.  
Ranger created a device resembling a music box, where fingers on a revolving drum plucked a set of reeds.  
There were three sets of eight reeds, one for each note, allowing the generation of the fundamental note 
plus several overtones.   Each reed formed one plate of a capacitor in an oscillator circuit, and the signal 
generated by all reeds was amplified by a single 6C6 pentode tube.  It was activated by a timer,
which would cut off the program two seconds before its end (whether it was finished or 
not!) and feed the chimes to the network. <p>

NBC built a limited number of chime machines. NBC in San Francisco  had two of them - the main and backup 
machines.  Others were installed ain other cities around the country where network programs were originated 
– Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and perhaps a few others.  It is likely that not more than a dozen chimes 
machines were ever made. </p><center>

The photos on this page show one of the few chime machines still in existence, now in the hands of a private 
collector.  (NBC had the short-sighted habit of discarding large quantities of historical artifacts throughout 
its history.  It's only through the far-sightedness of a few NBC employees, who saved some of these items 
from the trash bins, that we can today experience many recorded programs, photos, and other memorabilia from 
that era.)
<p>

&nbsp;The unit shown is the chimes machine serial number 2, probably from the first group ever made.   Its mechanical 
parts, although finely crafted, appear to have been hand made.  This unit is no doubt the original chimes machine 
placed in operation at NBC's studios at 111 Sutter Street in San Francisco.  The schematic diagram, 
also shown, indicates that serial number 5 was fabricated in 1933, so this machine would have 
predated it.  The main cabinet contains the motor drive reed mechanism and amplifier, which is accessed by  
removing the front panel's four thumbscrews.  The unit operated from an external power source, no doubt the same 
battery and motor generator system that operated the audio amplifiers in the studios.   The smaller box 
contains the timer and switches that operate the chimes for both studio and "NEMO" broadcast lines.  
("NEMO" was a term used in early radio to indicate a remote broadcast.  It comes from a telephone term, 
and stands for "Not Emanating Main Office".)  The chime machine could be operated in an automatic mode by 
the clock, which was the usual method of operation, or manually by the announcer in the event of programs 
with imprecise ending times, such as sports broadcasts.

&nbsp;<p>The NBC chimes were officially registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1950 as a registered service mark, the first 
known case of a sound receiving trademark protection.  They were last heard regularly on NBC 
television in 1976, used to mark the 50th anniversary of the network. </p>

  <p>Here is a remembrance of the NBC 
  Chimes Machine from Rick Greenhut - February 3, 2013:</p>
  
  <p>
  <span>John,</span></p></div>

<p>
<span>Just saw your 
page on the Bay Area Radio Museum dedicated to the NBC chimes machine, and I 
wanted to give you another historical fact to add. In 1969 when I went to work 
as a summer replacement engineer (board op) at NBC-owned WKYC Cleveland, there 
was still a chimes machine back in the racks. Since all the O&amp;O's originated 
programs like NOTH (New On The Hour) and Monitor inserts, they all had 2 chimes 
machines. Besides WNBC/New York, WMAQ/Chicago and KNBR/San Francisco, 
WKYC/Cleveland and WRC/Washington also had chimes machines.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>By the next 
  summer I worked there, the chimes machine was gone - whether thrown away or 
  taken home by one of the old-timers, I couldn't say.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>Last bit of 
  radio trivia: I was doing Affiliate Relations for the NBC Radio Network in 
  August of 1987, and during the NABET engineers strike those of us in 
  management with technical backgrounds were taking shifts running the board for 
  the NOTH and manning the ROD (Radio Operations Desk) in Radio Central (network 
  master control). I was the first management person on the board when the 
  engineers walked out at 6:00 AM that morning, and engineered the 6, 7, 8 and 9 
  AM NOTH (the talent was Gary Nunn, now heard on the CBS Radio Network). At 
  8:30 that morning I was told by the General Manager, Craig Simon, that the 
  network had been sold to Westwood One, and that the chimes were not part of 
  the sale, so I was forbidden to play them at the end of the newscast like we 
  usually did.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>I ignored 
  him, and "chimed out" at the end of the 9:00 AM newscast as per usual. He came 
  up to the studio a few minutes later with a funny smile on his face, and told 
  me to make sure no one else did that. I made sure by taking the chimes cart 
  and backup out of the studio. I bulked the backup, and have the last remaining 
  cart with the NBC chimes (recorded directly from the WNBC chimes machine) in 
  my collection.</span></p>

<p>
  <span>I was the 
  last person to play the chimes on the NBC Radio Network.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-4f5abb4a=""> <div><p><strong>"When it comes to data security versus ease of access, it's usually a trade-off. The fact that IPFS doesn't compromise on either is awesome — and it feels great to ditch Amazon S3 buckets for open source."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">#</a> Overview</h2> <p><img src="https://docs.ipfs.io/assets/img/logo-arbol.e1ca2350.svg" alt="Arbol logo" width="220"></p> <p><a href="https://www.arbolmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arbol</a> is a software platform that connects agricultural entities like farmers and other weather-dependent parties with investors and other capital providers to insure and protect against weather-related risks. Arbol's platform sells contracts for parametric weather protection agreements in a marketplace that's an innovative, data-driven approach to risk management, cutting out the usual legacy insurance claims process of making loss assessments on the ground. Instead, Arbol relies on tamper-proof data indexes to determine payouts, and doesn't require a defined loss to be indemnified. Arbol's platform combines parametric weather protection with blockchain-based smart contracts to provide cost-efficient, automated, and user-defined weather-related risk hedging. As with traditional crop insurance and similar legacy products, end users purchase assurance that they'll be financially protected in the case of adverse weather — but with Arbol, these end users are paid automatically if adverse conditions occur, as defined by the contract and measured by local meteorological observations tracked by Arbol's data sources.</p> <p>To build the data indexes that Arbol uses to handle its contracts, the team aggregates and standardizes billions of data files comprising decades of weather information from a wide range of reputable sources — all of which is stored on IPFS. IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model due to the inherent verifiability provided by its <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content-addressed architecture</a>, as well as a decentralized data delivery model that facilitates Arbol's day-to-day aggregation, synchronization, and distribution of massive amounts of data.</p> <p>While United States agribusiness has been Arbol's initial area of focus, the team has built a globally capable platform, with expansion underway to new regions and industries around the world. Arbol currently provides contracts for managing the risks of weather exposure in the energy and agriculture sectors, and features both custom and pre-designed protection agreements for clients across industries and scale. Their current end-user base ranges from small coffee farms to major agribusinesses and power producers.</p> <p>In short, Arbol's platform is a risk marketplace where end users can get competitively priced risk management solutions and capital providers can benefit from access to a lucrative, but underdeveloped, weather risk market. And because Arbol uses IPFS for its data storage and delivery needs, end users and underwriting partners can be certain that the data Arbol uses to determine price and payouts for contracts is tamper-proof and trustworthy.</p> <h3 id="arbol-by-the-numbers"><a href="#arbol-by-the-numbers">#</a> Arbol by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>1T</p> <p>weather-related data points hosted on IPFS</p></div><div><p>1M</p> <p>hashes generated on Arbol data every day</p></div><div><p>40</p> <p>years of high-resolution climate data</p></div><div><p>200GB</p> <p>average Arbol dataset size</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Arbol's story begins with the commodities markets, where Siddhartha Jha, the founder and CEO, worked as a quantitative analyst and portfolio manager. What Jha saw there was a problem without a solution: Massive (and growing) demand for weather risk management for supply chains, farming industries, and the energy sector, but no viable, efficient, or cost-effective weather risk market to meet that demand. Traditional crop insurance was plagued by inefficiencies and high cost ceilings, with insurance providers forced to charge high premiums that only large corporations could afford. And while more efficient parametric insurance solutions were available on the market, even these data-driven options were often saddled with high overhead and bureaucratic waste. As a result, small businesses and local farmers were often trapped without access to protection from weather-related risks.</p> <p>Arbol aims to change that by bringing fundamental transparency, efficiency, and data-driven objectivity to the weather risk market, ensuring that any business of any size can get the appropriate protection they need to manage their level of weather-related risk. The Arbol platform achieves this goal by providing a novel mechanism for weather-exposed businesses to connect with capital providers. The key to Arbol's approach is flexible financial derivatives that leverage the power of big data and machine learning to provide parametric risk protection at low cost. These parametric structures determine automatic payouts based on metrics that are strongly correlated with financial loss.</p> <p>With Arbol, an end user pays to hedge against a specific weather-related event, such as yearly deviation in rainfall amounts or temperature. After deciding on a premium and selecting a payout amount, the end user then relies on Arbol's platform to handle the rest. Because parametric structures are objective and data-driven, they can achieve a level of precision, reliability, and cost effectiveness that traditional insurance cannot. In fact, one of Arbol's key benefits over legacy weather insurance is that it allows for hyper-local protection for managing user-specific levels of risk.</p> <p>Arbol's approach also improves upon standard parametric insurance by combining parametric insurance's precision and flexibility with the security, transparency, and efficiency of blockchain. Many of Arbol's protection agreement contracts are executed as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts automatically deliver payouts to end users as soon as a relevant adverse weather event occurs.</p> <p>Delivering weather risk management solutions through blockchain-based contracts like this eliminates costly payout delays, as well as risks associated with fraud, corruption, and bureaucratic overhead. It also brings the benefits of peer-to-peer decentralization: Arbol users don't need to rely on Arbol as a financial middleman, because funds are locked between end users and capital providers without Arbol controlling the transfer of funds.</p> <p>However, even the best smart contract is only as smart as the data it draws from. The "oracle problem" can be a foundational obstacle for smart contracts — but Arbol's use of IPFS eliminates this risk. Because a smart contract automatically and trustlessly executes based on data, it doesn't matter how secure, transparent, and publicly verifiable its use of blockchain is. Without an accurate, trustworth, and immutable data "oracle", even blockchain-based smart contracts can be easily biased, compromised, or manipulated. For Arbol, that's where IPFS is absolutely critical.</p> <p>IPFS's content-addressed architecture enables Arbol to ensure the integrity and public verifiability of its datasets, something that traditional location addressing using centralized server architecture cannot provide. Smart contracts pointing to specific, immutable IPFS CIDs, rather than to data locations that could be tampered with, can be relied upon thanks to the integrity of their oracle.</p> <div><p><strong>"IPFS is very much at the heart of everything we do at Arbol. IPFS serves as our independently verifiable data store for all of the weather data associated with the contracts we sell. It imbues our platform with the essential principles of decentralization, data security, and public verifiability."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <p>Arbol builds its data indexes by drawing on large weather-related datasets from a variety of trusted public and private sources, including prominent U.S. government institutions such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These sources track weather data including yearly rainfall amounts, temperature fluctuations, wind speeds, and more. However, while much of the data Arbol uses is publicly available, it isn't always easily usable; much of the data, particularly deeper historical records, is stored in outdated formats, and very little of it is organized into an easily readable structure. Arbol's data indexes process, correlate, and package this data so that it is readily available for use in the weather risk market. And by putting that data onto IPFS, Arbol also ensures that it has a verifiable, tamper-resistant, and decentralized home.</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Arbol's business model hinges upon the benefits afforded by IPFS — without its immutable content addressing and inherent data verifiability, the benefits Arbol provides would be impossible to achieve in a cost-effective and efficient way. As a whole, IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model by providing the following:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Immutable addressing:</strong> Because all data stored using IPFS is referenced and accessed via unique <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content identifiers (CIDs)</a>, any change to a data item means it receives a new CID exclusive to that revision. It's impossible to change data without changing its CID.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data verifiability:</strong> Contracts on Arbol's platform are linked to specific, verifiably unchanged, content-addressed data. Because parametric weather risk management absolutely relies on user agreement about and trust in source data, Arbol's approach offers reassurance unavailable with other offerings in the market.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Decentralized data delivery:</strong> Arbol works with massive datasets comprising billions of files and terabytes of information. IPFS accommodates Arbol's methodology for publishing and adding to large datasets while still enabling Arbol to release and synchronize these datasets via a decentralized storage network.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="how-arbol-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-arbol-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Arbol uses IPFS</h2> <p>Arbol's end users enjoy the "it just works" benefits of parametric protection, but a lot goes on behind the scenes to enable this data-driven solution. Arbol's weather datasets range from 1GB to 1TB in size, and each one goes through a detailed ingestion process before it can be used. Once it has been decided that a dataset meets Arbol's criteria for usefulness and validity, it is time to add it to Arbol's IPFS pipeline, a multi-stage process outlined below.</p> <ol><li><p><strong>Query/release:</strong> If a …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<p>
08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

        <h2 id="in-which-i-am-stunted-upon-by-coin-flips">In which I am stunted upon by coin flips</h2>
<p>Wasn’t too long ago that I felt pretty good about my knowledge of distributed systems.
All someone <em>really</em> needed in order to understand them, I thought, was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o">thorough understanding of the paxos protocol</a> and a willingless to reshape your brain in the image of TLA+.
Maybe add a dash of conflict-free-replicated datatypes, just so you know what “eventual consistency” means.
Past that it’s just some optimizations and mashups which come easily to your TLA+-addled brain.</p>
<p>This belief proved surprisingly robust over a number of years, even surviving an aborted attempt at analyzing the <a href="https://github.com/ahelwer/tla-experiments/blob/master/Nano.tla">Nano cryptocurrency</a>.
It was only after encountering <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/06/snowflake-to-avalanche-novel-metastable.html">the snowflake family of consensus protocols</a> that I realized my theory just wasn’t up to the challenge.
The issue was <em>probability</em>: snowflake protocols reach consensus by iteratively polling sets of other nodes at random, and the argument that consensus is eventually reached is a statistical argument deriving an upper bound on the probability of failure.</p>
<p>I didn’t <em>dislike</em> probability &amp; statistics, I just tried to keep my distance as much as possible.
All the algorithms in distributed systems I’d encountered so far involved <em>nondeterminism</em>, sure, but not probability.
I’d assumed nondeterminism was just a more flexible way of reasoning about probability.
This idea of mine would prove to be a source of great unnecessary confusion as I learned the art of reasoning about probabilistic distributed systems, so I’ll do you a favor and give you the core lesson of this entire post in one sentence:</p>
<p><strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism, and you cannot model nondeterminism with probability.</strong></p>
<h2 id="models-theyre-good-folks">Models: they’re good, folks!</h2>
<p>Have you ever been writing some multithreaded code, happily plugging in a mutex here, a semaphore there, or even just using some nice message-passing primitives to make your threads all get along?
Maybe you’ll be familiar, then, with what often comes next.
A scratch at the back of your mind, a thought - <em>“oh, wait…"</em> - as you realize something weird will happen if thread \(A\) manages to reach some step before thread \(B\) has finished its assigned task.
No worries! Slap on another WaitHandle, problem solved.
Except the problem wasn’t solved. Not really.
You consider it a bit more - what if thread \(C\) comes in with a message at this inopportune time?
You realize with dawning horror you’re actually tracing cracks in the foundation.
Patch them with mutexes! Semaphores! Anything!
Alas, you are beyond help. It’s around this time that your brain, catching a glimpse of the infinite plane of combinatorial state explosion, wisely ducks its head back down for the day and leaves you with a woozy, fuzzy, clenching feeling for having the gall to ask it to fix all this.</p>
<p>I’ve felt like this many times, and formal models are the only cure I’ve ever found.
Your brain isn’t built to hold massive state spaces in its working memory, so don’t even try.
Let a model checking program churn through all those states to find the bugs.
At this point I won’t even touch a multithreaded program or distributed system without whipping up a quick TLA+ spec of its desired workings.
I just specify all the possible events in the system, how those events affect the system state, what things I always want to remain true (the invariants), then let the model checker rip.
In TLA+, we model concurrency with nondeterminism; in a concurrent system, we have no idea whether thread \(A\) will execute a step before thread \(B\).
We can represent this with a nondeterministic state machine as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/nondeterministic.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>So you’ll be in state \(s_3\) if thread \(A\) executes its step before thread \(B\), and state \(s_4\) if thread \(B\) executes its step before thread \(A\).
Maybe \(s_3\) and \(s_4\) are even the same state, who knows.
The model checker will explore both of these possible execution orders, and <strong>in a well-designed concurrent system we should <em>never</em> end up in a bad state just because of a certain order of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Readers might wonder how exactly this models concurrency, where steps can happen uh, concurrently.
The short answer is you have to ensure all the steps in your model are atomic or independent: either impossible in the real world for two of your steps to happen at the exact same time (for example, by assuming use of a lower-level hardware synchronization primitive) or impossible for execution of one step to directly affect the same variables as another step (for example, if the steps are executed on different computers within a timespan less than the network latency between them).
If the steps in your model satisfy this requirement, checking all possible execution orders accurately models concurrency.
If they don’t, you need to break the steps down further so they do.
This model nicely captures &amp; exposes all that is difficult about concurrency.</p>
<p>What questions can we ask about this sort of model?
The most important questions are <em>reachability queries</em> - can we reach a <em>bad state</em> (two caches disagreeing on a value, deadlock, dogs &amp; cats living together, etc.) from the starting state?
These questions are called <em>safety properties</em>, and if they are answered in the negative then the system is safe.
Another type of query is something like “are we always guaranteed to eventually end up in a good state?”
These are called <em>liveness properties</em>.
Turns out these two types of questions can get you pretty far in concurrent &amp; distributed systems.
Definitely far enough to make a whole career out of writing rock-solid software in places others would falter.
However, these questions also have a drawback: their answers are absolute.
True or false.
No probability involved, no room for nuance.</p>
<p>What if one of the threads flips a coin, and if it’s heads it does one thing, tails another?
Entire state spaces, bifurcated by a probabilistic event.
Maybe those state spaces contain further coin flips, or other types of randomness.
In this system your questions might change from the form “is it possible to reach a bad state” to “what is the probability of reaching a bad state?”
Unfortunately these types of questions just cannot be answered within the nondeterministic model used above.
<strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism.</strong>
We must use a new type of model, a state machine that handles probability directly.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-the-beautiful-pure-discrete-realm">Leaving the beautiful pure discrete realm</h2>
<p>TLA+ can’t handle probability at this time, so we’d have to use a specialized modeling language like <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> which handles probabilistic state machines.
Let’s look at the standard hello-world example for probabilistic state machines: the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=KY76">1976 Knuth-Yao method</a> for simulating a fair six-sided die with a series of coin flips.
This is really quite a neat problem and I encourage you to ponder it for a second before seeing how they did it!
Any sequence of \(n\) coin flips will give you an event which has probability \(\frac{1}{2^n}\) of occurring.
Simulating a fair six-sided die requires generating an event with probability \(\frac{1}{6}\) of occurring.
You might then reason this problem is impossible, because you cannot evenly divide \(2^n\) by \(6\) for any \(n\) (this follows from the uniqueness of prime factorization).
Indeed, there is no way to simulate a six-sided die with a finite number of coin flips.
We have to use an algorithm which is not guaranteed to ever terminate, although vanishingly unlikely not to do so.
Here it is:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/knuth-yao.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that if you somehow only flip heads, or only flip tails, you’ll never reach one of the accepting states (here labeled with the die number they represent).
There are some fun ways to contextualize the probabilities of you only flipping heads or tails a certain number of times in a row.
For example, there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">around \(2^{268}\) subatomic particles in the observable universe</a>; if you manage to flip heads 268 times in a row, that’s the same as picking the correct subatomic particle out of a universe-wide random draw.
Maybe go look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> as you ponder this probability.
Another way is assuming you’re between the ages of 25-34 and live in the USA, your annual all-cause mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">about 129/100,000</a>.
Assuming deaths are uniformly distributed throughout the year, this means your chances of dying today are about 1 in 283,000.
This is just 18 all-heads or all-tails coin flips in a row.
What I’m saying is that you really, really shouldn’t worry about having to flip the coin very many times.</p>
<p>This probabilistic state machine model we’ve created is called a <em>Discrete-Time Markov Chain</em>, or DTMC.
In DTMCs, every transition has an associated probability and the probabilities of all out-flowing transitions must sum to one for every state (accepting states can be thought to have a loopback with probability 1).
The above rumination on termination probabilities is summed up in <em>the long run theorem</em>: in the long run, every path in a finite Markov chain ends in an absorbing state, which is a state (or group of states) from which there is an entrance but no exit.
What questions can we ask of DTMCs?
The most interesting one - the reason why we’re here - is “what is the probability of eventually reaching a certain state?”
The long run theorem tells us we have a 100% chance of eventually reaching <em>one</em> of the Knuth-Yao state machine’s accepting states.
What about the probability of ending up in a specific accepting state?
It should be \(\frac{1}{6}\). Is it?</p>
<p>Let’s try to reason this out with basic probability.
What are the chances of ending up in accepting state \(1\)?
Well, you can get there by flipping \(HHT\).
The probability of that happening is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \).
But you can also get there by flipping \(HHHHT\).
The probability of <em>that</em> happening is \(\frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).
We have to add this to the first probability, so now our probability is \(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{32}\).
But we can <em>also</em> get there …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust doesn’t have namespaces in its package management system. It’s often viewed as a bug. But it’s not a bug, it’s a feature! While there are negative aspects of a flat package registry, there are also real benefits. Stability, continuity, and unity (discourages forks and fragmented identity). Proposals that seek to add namespacing without addressing the positive aspects they remove probably won’t be accepted.</p><p>I have noticed the benefits of the current system seem to only get mentioned in passing as objections to proposals and never outlined anywhere. This is an attempt to fix that by summarizing points raised across the various proposals I’ve read. While I don’t represent the crates.io team (I’m not even on the team) I hope to accurately represent trade-offs being considered.</p><h2 id="aspects-of-registry-structure">Aspects of Registry Structure</h2><p>How identity works in package management has far-reaching consequences. Most of the namespace proposals I’ve seen have been motivated by trying to address squatting and/or tweaking the current system of package identity. However, the structure of the crates.io registry affects more than just those areas. But we’ll start with the basics of identity and work from there.</p><h3 id="identity">Identity</h3><p>How do you refer to a package? A crate has at least three identities I can think of:</p><ul><li>The name on crates.io - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The name used in Cargo.toml - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The default name used in code - there is can be more than one per name, which is rare in practice</li><li>The actual name used in code - this can be controlled through Cargo.toml or externs statements, but renaming isn’t required</li></ul><p>The first two are called the <code>package.name</code> in Cargo.toml of the crate being published. The third can be overridden via <code>lib.name</code> in the package being published. The last is user-controlled. Usually, all of these names match, with the caveat that dashes are underscores in code (and crates.io doesn’t allow two crates with identical crates.io names after normalizing dashes to underscores).</p><p>Arguably, self-explanatory identities have a leg up on other identities from a discoverability perspective. E.g. <code>argparse</code> probably seems more reputable at first glance than <code>clap</code> if you’re going of name alone.</p><p>A flat registry makes identity management (naming a crate) harder. You either have to pick a GUID (haha, please don’t) or some memorable (but probably mostly or completely unrelated) identity. I see this as the main driving force for proposals seeking to add namespaces or otherwise address squatting.</p><h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3><p>Currently, identity is continuous - a crate’s identity is immutable and that has real benefits. If you want to change the identity system at all you’ve got to ensure that identities don’t change out from under you. This is a strike against any namespace system that allows namespace ownership to unexpectedly change. Discontinuous identity has a couple of issues.</p><p>First, if a crate’s name can change, that’s bad for users. They have to go figure out the new name of the package if they want to update.</p><p>Second, if an identity’s crate can change (a consequence of the previous point if identities are reusable), then you’ve introduced a security vulnerability. Updating to a new package version with different content under different ownership is a real security risk. Doubly so if you don’t ban new minor versions on the last major version after an unintentional ownership change. Should people audit their crate? Yes! But the fewer foot-guns we have the better.</p><p>In addition to preventing security issues, proposals need to encourage transitions over transactions. Gradual moves over all-or-nothing moves. This could be seen more as compatibility than continuity. This drives things like the rust editions and the need for namespace proposals to be backward compatible.</p><h3 id="stability">Stability</h3><p>A core tenet of Rust is stability. The obvious definition is that things that compile yesterday should compile today (even with a new compiler).</p><p>A less obvious definition is that adding new dependencies shouldn’t stop you from compiling already working code. This is a major motivation for the orphan rule (though the orphan rule is more nuanced than that). This is a strike against schemes that encourage multiple distinct crates to have the same default name in code. I don’t think any proposal that encourages this could be approved. It also suggests that we ought to ban new instances of a crates default code name deviating from its package/Cargo.toml name.</p><p>In addition to code stability, crates.io should be stable too. It should be able to isolate itself from outside services. It currently depends on Github, but it doesn’t have to. This is a strike against any system that weds namespace identity to any externally managed system.</p><h3 id="squatting">Squatting</h3><p>The current identity system encourages squatting. I would define squatting as reserving a crate without actually using it. This is a natural outcome in the Rust ecosystem for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>Crates are easy to publish, so it’s easy to reserve a crate by publishing an empty crate</li><li>We have de-facto namespaces using prefixes - <code>serde-*</code> is one example.</li><li>There can only ever be one version of a package name. There is only one <code>http</code> crate for example. So package names are a scarce resource.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot of squatting on crates.io. I don’t have any hard numbers though.</p><p>We don’t have any structured support for squatting either, which makes it hard to separate bad actors from good actors. I think separating them out would require manual intervention, and the crates.io team is small and doesn’t have a lot of time to put towards that.</p><p>So what’s a bad actor? I consider someone who squats a bunch of crates to make or point or prevent their names from being used to be a bad actor. Crates.io has a policy against using automation to claim ownership of crates, but I haven’t heard much about it being enforced. Again, time is an issue. And this would probably extend to namespace ownership as well.</p><p>I do think there are legitimate uses. Reserving a set of extension crates for a project you’re working on is one example. My other example is reserving a crate you genuinely intend to work on (this one is a little more debatable).</p><h2 id="it-s-about-the-trade-offs">It’s about the Trade-offs</h2><p>With this system in mind, it’s hard to come up with a namespace proposal that doesn’t hurt the current system in some way.</p><p>I’d say the biggest tension is in code-level identities. They become either overlapping by chopping the namespace portion off or much longer by including the namespace portion. The previous points show why overlapping is generally considered a non-starter. And for longer identities, you need to come up with some new way to reference namespaces in code that’s doesn’t break things.</p><p>More to the point though, from what I’ve seen, most people proposing identity schemes propose it so that the ecosystem can support the overlapping crate identities (e.g. multiple http crates). And that’s exactly what the current system avoids doing.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">an on-point quote from CAD97</a> summing up (hopefully fairly accurately) what namespaces mean to the parties involved:</p><blockquote><p>To the crates team, it seems to <em>primarily</em> mean that a project can put multiple packages together under an umbrella, such that you know the packages are for-sure by the project.</p><p>To the people who feel most slighted by the crates team’s approach here, namespaces <em>primarily</em> mean the ability to publish a crate with a desired name even if there’s already a package published that provides a crate with that name, by putting the package into a different namespace such that the names do not clash.</p><p>If the latter party asks about “namespaces” and means the latter, and the team answers and means the former, you can see where the miscommunication enters, especially since the crates team has now communicated here the position that <em>generally</em>, the <code>package.name == lib.name</code> falsehood should not be made more false; i.e., the latter group’s goal is an explicitly non-desired property from the crates team.</p></blockquote><h2 id="where-to-now">Where to Now?</h2><p>There have been other proposals for namespaces that are less about overlapping identity and more about curation and grouping related crates together. There are multiple proposals there, each with their trade-offs. Expect a follow-up post discussing some of those.</p><h2 id="appendix-a-highlights">Appendix A: Highlights</h2><p>There’s a nice set of a dozen or so comments I save as I reviewed past discussions:</p><p>Carol10Cents (of the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20</a></li></ul><p>kornel:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26</a></li></ul><p>sgrif (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7</a></li></ul><p>CAD97:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633</a></li></ul><p>withoutboats (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10</a></li></ul><p>ag_dubs (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28</a></li></ul><p>pietroalbini (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791</a></li></ul><p>Random meeting notes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT">https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT</a></li></ul><h2 id="appendix-b-previous-discussions">Appendix B: Previous Discussions</h2><p>There have been several attempts at this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320</a> (This was mine from last year after reading through the other proposals; my …</li></ul></div></div>

			<p>These days your primary means of listening to music if likely from an app on your phone. So how do you get the music from your phone to your laptop or desktop that has better speakers?</p>
<p>The answer is to use Bluetooth and <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a>. PulseAudio is the modern sound implementation on the Linux desktop. It runs as a sound server and takes sound inputs such a microphone or your browser playing a YouTube video and directs this sound to outputs such as your Laptop’s speakers.</p>
<p>PulseAudio can take the audio from a Bluetooth connection and route it to your laptop’s speakers and is very simple to get running.</p>
<p>First, install the PulseAudio Bluetooth modules. On ArchLinux this is called <code>pulseaudio-bluetooth</code> and on Ubuntu/Debian it is called <code>pulseaudio-module-bluetooth</code>.</p>
<p>After you have installed this package open the following file:</p>
<pre><code>/etc/pulse/system.pa
</code></pre><p>And add the following couple of lines:</p>
<pre><code>load-module module-bluetooth-policy
load-module module-bluetooth-discover
</code></pre><p>Then, as your regular user, restart PulseAudio:</p>
<pre><code>$ pulseaudio -k

		<p>Checked exceptions have always been a controversial feature of the Java language.</p>
<p>Advocates claim they ensure checking &amp; recovery from failures. Detractors say “catch” blocks can almost never recover from an exception, and are a frequent source of mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Java 8 and lambdas are here. Are checked exceptions becoming obsolete in the Java world?<span id="more-174"></span></p>
<h3>The Intent of Checked Exceptions</h3>
<p>In the mid 90’s, James Gosling at Sun came up with a new language.</p>
<p>At the time, C++ programming required every single function return to be checked for error. He decided there had to be a better way, and built the concept of “exceptions” into Java.</p>
<p>The intent of <strong>checked exceptions</strong> was to locally flag, and force developers to handle, possible exceptions. Checked exceptions have to be declared on a method signature, or handled.</p>
<p>This was intended to encourage software reliability &amp; resilience. There was an intent to “recover” from contingencies – predictable outcomes other than success, such as InsufficientFundsException on attempting a payment. There was less clarity, as to what “recovery” actually entailed.</p>
<p><strong>Runtime exceptions</strong>&nbsp;were also included in Java. Since null pointers, data errors, and illegal states/ accesses could occur anywhere in code, these were made subtypes of RuntimeException.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions can be thrown anywhere, without requiring to be declared, and are much more convenient. But would it be correct to use them instead?</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The crucial point here, is that runtime &amp; checked exceptions are functionally equivalent.&nbsp;There is no handling or recovery which checked exceptions can do, that runtime exceptions can’t.</p>
<p>The biggest argument against “checked” exceptions is that most exceptions can’t be fixed. The simple fact is, <strong>we don’t own the code/ subsystem that broke.&nbsp;</strong>We can’t see the implementation, we’re not responsible for it, and can’t fix it.</p>
<p>Particularly problematic were the areas of JDBC (SQLException) and RMI for EJB (RemoteException). Rather than identifying fixable contingencies as per the original “checked exception” concept, these forced pervasive systemic reliability issues, not actually fixable, to be widely declared.</p>
<p>For any method, the possibility of failure includes all sub-methods called by it. Potential failures accumulate up the call tree. Declaring these on method signatures no longer offers a specific &amp; local highlight for the developer to watch for – declared exceptions spread throughout the call tree.</p>
<p>Most EJB developers have experienced this – declared exceptions become&nbsp;required on methods through the tier,&nbsp;or entire codebase. Calling a method with different&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;requires dozens of methods to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Many developers were told to catch low-level exceptions, and rethrow them again as higher (application-level) checked exceptions. This required vast numbers – 2000 per project, upwards – of non-functional “catch-throw” blocks.</p>
<p>Swallowing exceptions, concealing the cause, double logging, and returning ‘null’/ uninitialized data all became common. Most projects could count 600+ mis-coded or outright errors.</p>
<p>Eventually, developers rebelled against the vast numbers of “catch” blocks, and the source of error these had become.</p>
<h3>Checked Exceptions – incompatible with Functional Coding</h3>
<p>And then we get to Java 8, with its new <i><b>functional programming&nbsp;</b></i>features – such as lambdas, Streams, and function composition.</p>
<p>These features are built on generics – parameter &amp; return types are genericized, so that iteration &amp; stream operations ( <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>) can be written which perform a common operation, regardless of item type.</p>
<p>Unlike data types, however, declared exceptions can’t be genericized.</p>
<p>There is no possibility in Java to provide a stream operation (like, for example, &nbsp;<code>Stream.map</code>) which takes a lambda declaring some checked exception, &amp; transparently passes that same checked exception to surrounding code.</p>
<p>This has always been a major points against checked exceptions – all intervening code, between a throw and the receiving “catch” block, is forced to be aware of exceptions.</p>
<p>The workaround, of “wrapping” it in a RuntimeException, conceals the original type of the exception – rendering the exception-specific “catch” blocks envisaged in the original concept useless.</p>
<p>Finally we can capture Java’s new philosophy in a nutshell, by noting that none of the new “functional interfaces” in Java 8 declare checked exceptions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Exceptions in Java provided major benefits in reliability &amp; error-handling over earlier languages.&nbsp;Java enabled reliable server &amp; business software, in a way C/ C++ never could.</p>
<p>Checked exceptions were,&nbsp;in their original form, an attempt&nbsp;to handle&nbsp;<i>contingencies</i>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<i>failures</i>.&nbsp;The laudable goal was to highlight specific predictable points (unable to connect,&nbsp;file not found,&nbsp;etc) &amp; ensure developers handled these.</p>
<p>What was never included in the original concept, was to force a vast range of systemic &amp;&nbsp;unrecoverable failures to be declared. These <em>failures</em>&nbsp;were never correct to be&nbsp;declared as checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Failures are generally possible in code, and EJB, web &amp; Swing/AWT containers already cater for this by providing an outermost “failed request” exception-handler. The most basic correct strategy is to rollback the transaction &amp; return an error.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions allow any exception-handling possible with checked exceptions, but avoid restrictive coding restraints. This simplifies coding &amp; makes it easier to follow best practice of&nbsp;<a href="http://wikijava.org/wiki/10_best_practices_with_Exceptions#Throw_early_catch_late" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://wikijava.org']);">throw early, catch late</a>&nbsp;where exceptions are handled at the outermost/ highest possible level.</p>
<p>Leading Java frameworks and influences have now definitively moved&nbsp;away from checked exceptions. Spring, Hibernate and modern Java frameworks/&nbsp;vendors&nbsp;use only runtime exceptions, and this convenience is a major factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>Personalities such Josh Bloch (Java&nbsp;Collections framework), Rod Johnson, Anders Hejlsberg (father of&nbsp;C#), Gavin King&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn&nbsp;(JodaTime)&nbsp;have all come out against checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, in&nbsp;Java 8,&nbsp;lambdas are&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundamental step forward.&nbsp;These language features&nbsp;abstract the “flow of control” from functional operations within. As we’ve seen, this makes checked exceptions &amp; the requirement to “declare or handle immediately” obsolete.</p>
<p>For developers, it is always important to pay attention to reliability &amp; diagnose likely points of failure (contingencies) such as file open, database connection, etc. If we provide good error messages at this points, we will have&nbsp;created&nbsp;self-diagnosing software – a pinnacle of engineering achievement.</p>
<p>But we should do this with unchecked exceptions, and if we have to rethrow, should always use RuntimeException or an app-specific subclass.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn says, if your projects&nbsp;are&nbsp;still using or advocating checked exceptions, your skills are 5-10 years out date.&nbsp;Java&nbsp;has moved&nbsp;on.</p>
<p><strong>How are you dealing with exceptions &amp; reliability? Add your thoughts now.</strong></p>

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. The doc recommended I up the dosage, but I could see this would eventually lead me to a straitjacket.</p>



<p>Over the years I’ve tried different meds, various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as clinical depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and covid anxiety. My longest bouts of depression now last a day at most and even that doesn’t happen too often.</p>



<p>You can try it too: <a href="https://beta.wuju.app/">beta.wuju.app</a></p>
