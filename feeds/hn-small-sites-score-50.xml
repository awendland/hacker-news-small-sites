<p><em>If you’d like to get an Amiga Parceiro for yourself, I explain how you can pre-order one at a heavily discounted rate at the end of the video and this article.</em></p><p>


A couple of years ago I made some videos where I showed my favorite Amiga 1000 setup at that time. It had two main hardware super powers that made it my daily driver. </p><p>

First, a fly-by of a glorious <a href="https://youtu.be/ZmW6LEwgruE">Rejuvenator board</a>, designed by the late Greg Tibbs out of Ohio (RIP Greg). A local good friend of mine here in Seattle named Christian Stich helped me upgrade that board to utilize a rare A3000 Agnus I found that can use 2MB of Chip RAM, which he custom built adapters for it to use. It also has a Kickstart 1.3 ROM chip to accelerate the boot up process and lose the typical Kickstart floppy. </p><div>

<p><em>Christian here is removing the old DRAMs, which were eight 256Kx4 in DIP format. He then installed four custom 1Mx4 in SOJ format  DRAMs with an adapter board that converts them to DIP format.</em></p><p>


The second thing was a hardware combo where I used a Microbotics Starboard expansion made back in 1987 that provided both extra fast RAM (in this case 1Mb), a real-time clock, and a SCSI module called the <a href="https://youtu.be/6BLXxY7FG5M">StarDrive which allowed me to use an Iomega SCSI Zip</a> as an external 100 MB hard drive. It used a custom Workbench boot disk that would pass control from the floppy over to the Zip drive and essentially turn the Zip into a semi-autobooting hard drive, which was a total game changer for that system. For all intents and purposes, that Amiga 1000 became one of my favorite, most treasured systems in my entire Amiga collection. </p><p>

<strong>A1000 equipped Starboard with SCSI Zip 100 as a hard drive </strong></p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BLXxY7FG5M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>
Fast-forward to today, as I made the difficult decision to <em>remove</em> the Starboard and Zip drive and replace it with a brand new device called the <strong>Amiga Parceiro</strong>. (Parceiro in Portuguese means “partner”.) So it’s the Friend Partner. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"></p><p>

The Amiga Parceiro was invented over the course of the past year by an Amiga hobbyist named David Dunklee who resides in a small town outside of Colorado Springs, CO. </p><p>

As Dunklee puts it:</p><div>

<p>
Fun Trivia: Mr Dunklee, now retired, was the CIO of the <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/">United States Space Force</a>, as well as an Air Force base commander. You heard that right, Number One. </p><p>


So let’s take a look at Mr. Dunklee’s new device for the Amiga 1000 and see what it can do. </p><p>

At a high level, the Parceiro can do everything my Starboard &amp; Zip combo could do except in a very tidy, modern package. And it can do it all faster and better. </p><div>

<p>
The Parceiro (sounds like par-say-ro) attaches to the side expansion port of the Amiga and is about the size of a harmonica that’s been run over by a steam roller as it’s only about 1/3 of an inch thick.</p><p>

It provides the following features: </p><ol><li> 8MB of Autoconfig Fast RAM. It is a single 8MB of SRAM versus DRAM, so it really and truly is indeed fast with zero wait states.</li> 
<li> Coin-cell battery backed Real Time Clock (RTC), which comes with its own clock software that gets put into your startup sequence.</li>
<li> SD Card Reader with 2GB MicroSD. It comes pre-formatted with the FAT32  file system and is readable on any PC as a result. This way you can quickly set up your new SD-based hard drive.</li></ol> <p>

It’s worth mentioning that this is running on period correct Amiga OS 1.3, too. </p><div>

<p>
Possibly the best unseen feature is the silkscreen prints Dunklee put around the various chips and resistors on the board. It’s a complete sci-fi treasure trove of labelling, from Back to the Future to Battlestar Galactica. </p><div>

For his fantastic creativity on the silkscreen, I half-jokingly suggested to Mr. Dunklee a future 3D printed case in clear acrylic so I could totally nerd out with his hilarious labels. And I think he might actually take me up on that idea some day! </p><div>

The Parceiro comes with instructions for creating your own KickWork disk to quickly boot up your machine and install all of the necessary software to run the device. This includes the necessary updates to your Mountlist, Startup-Sequence, adding fat95 drivers as well as the sd.device drivers. </p><p>

The <a href="https://amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=312">KickWork disk idea</a> is based off a product developed in 1988 by Mr. Rudolph Loew (RIP). This is where a Kickstart disk is combined with a stripped down Workbench disk for faster machine boot ups off a single floppy rather than 2. </p><p>

With the Parceiro, Dunklee provides six pages of detailed instructions for getting you up and running in no time. The idea here is the modified KickWork (or Workbench) disk will begin the machine’s boot up process like normal then hand over total control to the SD card like a full-fledged autobooting hard drive. It’s not 100% autobooting, but it’s pretty danged close. And once the machine fully boots you just pop out the boot floppy disk and set it to the side. Mr Dunklee confided with me that in a distant hardware update he might take the next logical step and integrate an FPGA for a true autobooting experience. </p><p>

Since my machine is equipped with a Rejuvenator board, I didn’t need a KickWork disk. So I made a customized Workbench boot disk making the necessary adjustments following Mr Dunklee’s instructions for the RTC software, the SD card device driver and adding the FAT file system library. </p><p>

In the Amiga world, this is about as close to plug-and-play for a device with this many features that I’ve ever come across that doesn’t completely take over your machine and its identity like a Vampire, or some might argue even the ACA500+ (which basically uses the A1000's power to mostly take over). The Parceiro installation was absolutely seamless and I got it up and running without a hitch. </p><p>

Now some of you might be wondering how long it takes to boot this 2GB equipped Amiga. For example, on my Amiga 2000 I have a 40 MB mechanical boot drive, but I also have a SCSI2SD card with 2GB MicroSD for all of my software and data storage. When that machine boots it can sit on a gray screen for about 20 -25 seconds while the large drive is being validated. Once that process is done the A2K snaps to life and I’m on my way. </p><p>

With the Parceiro it’s a very different - and better - experience than I’m used to. The Parceiro still needs to validate the empty space on the drive, but instead it does it in the background. So the Amiga 1000 boots up without that normal long pause. While the background validation is going on, the volume is set to READ ONLY. I can still run programs but I simply can’t write to the drive while the validation is going on. To be honest I wouldn’t even know about this had it not been noted in the instructions, as I’m virtually never writing to the drive the moment I boot it up. And within a few seconds the little Cylon red LED light stops flickering and I know then it’s job is complete (which didn’t directly affect me anyway). </p><p>

Very, very cool! </p><p>

Now, this device is currently in extremely short supply. In fact, I happened to get S/N #1 and I know S/N #2 was sold a few hours after I got mine. At that stage the inventory was sold out. But several more will eventually get made over time so if you’re an Amiga 1000 fan that means you're patient by default. <img src="https://www.amigalove.com/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"> I’d highly recommend you keep this on your radar and try to snag one of them for yourself. It’s simply bad ass and it didn’t require me to upgrade my OS beyond adding new drivers - or really change anything - like a lot of modern upgrades often do.  </p><p>

The Parceiro is a fantastic device, made in the USA, and is a very worthy successor to the Microbotics and Supra offerings from BITD. It is one of the few modern devices that is 100% designed for the Amiga 1000 for a change. And how cool and refreshing is that? </p><p>


<strong>Pre-Orders</strong></p><p>

If you’d like to pre-order one of these little technological marvels for yourself at a nearly <strong>20% discounted rate at $195</strong>, simply email <a href="https://www.amigalove.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7534181c12145b25140716101c071a351a0001191a1a1e5b161a18"><span data-cfemail="581935313f397608392a3b3d312a3718372d2c34373733763b3735">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> to declare your interest <strong>and mention AmigaLove sent you</strong>. You will still need to cover expenses for shipping, of course, but you’ll get in line for your very own Parceiro. David Dunklee will manage the rest from there!</p></div></div>]]>

			<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> has stormed into software development in
recent years. While the concepts behind it are powerful and useful, similar
tools have been used in systems for decades. FreeBSD’s
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html">jails</a> in one of those tools
which build upon even older <code>chroot(2)</code> To put it shortly, with these tools, you
can make a safe environment separated from the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Jails in FreeBSD is by no means a new tool (introduced in 4.X), but for a reason
or another, I haven’t used them that often, which is a shame since they are so
powerful. So I wanted to explore this concept in a concise and summarized
manner.</p>
<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>
<p>ZFS datasets are a great way of creating templates for jails since, after the
template creation, you can easily create new jails with <code>zfs clone</code> or <code>zfs send/receive</code>. Typically people tend to divide jails to complete and service
jails, where the former usually resembles a real FreeBSD system, and the latter
is often dedicated to applications/services. I’ll cover complete jails for now.</p>
<p>The creation of templates starts with creating a dataset for your jail and
template. Here I’ll make a new dataset for the base installation of FreeBSD
12.2.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=/vm zroot/vm
$ sudo zfs create zroot/vm/tmpl
$ sudo zfs create zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2
</code></pre><p>After that, fetch the base installation itself:</p>
<pre><code>$ fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/12.2-RELEASE/base.txz
# Fetch all the necessary stuff for your template, e.g. lib32 if needed
$ sudo tar -xJvpf base.txz -C /vm/tmpl/12.2
</code></pre><p>After that you should write a minimum viable <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> for the template:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/rc.conf
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to <code>rc.conf(5)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># Start or stop services
sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
syslogd_flags="-ss"
cron_flags="-J 60"
</code></pre><p>You can also disable some unnecessary jobs for jails:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/periodic.conf
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to <code>periodic.conf(5)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># No output for successful script runs.

security_status_ipfwlimit_enable="NO"
security_status_ipf6denied_enable="NO"
security_status_tcpwrap_enable="NO"
</code></pre><p>You also might want to enable ports in your jail:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /vm/tmpl/12.2/usr/ports
$ sudo mkdir -p /vm/tmpl/12.2/var/ports/{distfiles,packages}
$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/make.conf
</code></pre><pre><code>WRKDIRPREFIX = /var/ports
DISTDIR = /var/ports/distfiles
PACKAGES = /var/ports/packages
</code></pre><p>Apply system updates to the template:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo freebsd-update -b /vm/tmpl/12.2 fetch install
</code></pre><p>Lastly, take a snapshot:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs snapshot zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete
</code></pre><p>This creates a snapshot of <code>zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2</code> named <code>complete</code>. You can then check your current snapshots with:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs list -t snapshot
</code></pre><h2 id="creating-jails-from-the-template">Creating Jails from the Template</h2>
<p>Now you should be able to create a new jail based on that snapshot. You can do
it either with <code>zfs clone</code> or <code>zfs send/receive</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Difference Between the Two</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the
same as the dataset from which it was created. As with snapshots, creating a
clone is nearly instantaneous and initially consumes no additional disk
space. In addition, you can snapshot a clone.” [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The zfs send command creates a stream representation of a snapshot that is
written to standard output. By default, a full stream is generated. You can
redirect the output to a file or to a different system. The zfs receive
command creates a snapshot whose contents are specified in the stream that is
provided on standard input. If a full stream is received, a new file system is
created as well. You can send ZFS snapshot data and receive ZFS snapshot data
and file systems with these commands. See the examples in the next section.”
[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>$ sudo zfs clone zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete zroot/vm/jail1

# OR

$ sudo sh -c "zfs send zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete | zfs receive zroot/vm/jail1"
</code></pre><h2 id="jail-configurations">Jail Configurations</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These configurations is for very bare-bones jail, e.g. without any
mounts or advanced networking. Further configurations are discussed in future posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># /etc/rc.conf

cloned_interfaces="lo0"

# PF is used for NAT and port forwarding.
pf_enable="YES"
pflog_enable="YES"

jail_enable="YES"
jail_list="jail1"
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Refer to <code>jail.conf(5)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># /etc/jail.conf

exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
exec.clean;
mount.devfs;

host.hostname = $name;
path = "/vm/$name";
exec.consolelog = "/var/log/jail_${name}_console.log";
exec.prestart = "cp /etc/resolv.conf $path/etc";
exec.poststop = "rm $path/etc/resolv.conf";

jail1 {
        ip4.addr = "lo0|127.1.1.1/32";
        ip6.addr = "lo0|fd00:1:1:1::1/64";
        allow.chflags;
        allow.raw_sockets;
}
</code></pre><pre><code># /etc/hosts

<p>Start/stop all jails.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo service jail start

<pre><code>$ sudo service jail start jail1
</code></pre><p>Log in to jail.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo jexec jail1
</code></pre><p>Exec a command on a jail.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo jexec jail1 uname -a

</code></pre><p>List running jails.</p>
<pre><code>$ jls
   JID  IP Address      Hostname                      Path
     3  127.1.1.1       jail1                         /vm/jail1
</code></pre><p>So that’s how you can spin up a simple restricted environment on your FreeBSD
system. There are still lots of things to cover in this topic, e.g., in-depth
networking and configurations. But I think those deserve their own posts. So see
you soon!</p>

We will be taking a more precise look at that.</p>
<p>We will be exploring a Beginner to Expert Roadmap as designed by Tux in the infographic below
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610889439172/wAmw3SEGa.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="1603267450360.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://tryhackme.com/">tryhackme.com</a> provides a wide variety of security topics you can select from. These security topics give you access to different vulnerable machines and they are to be scanned and exploited with different tools for you to be able to complete the given tasks. Although there are certain aspects where you would require premium access, most of it is free. Every learning path comes with a different cybersecurity topic and they are very crucial to understand various concepts. TryHackMe Network can be connected to via OpenVPN in order to deploy machines / various Operating systems and carry out exploits.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://immersivelabs.online/">immersivelabs.online</a> is a gamified learning lab that is developed by experts as an emulation of world-class security threats. It allows you to visualize your capabilities as Hacker, practice with the latest discovered security threats, and earn points for completing labs.
It has over 600labs, and it's one of the coolest places to hon your skills</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">hackthebox.eu</a> is very much hard than the previous two because you can't sign up directly, you have to hack your way into the platform. It is focused on practicing your skills and it comes with a Social Network feeling as you can connect with millions of hackers on the platform, share ideas, methodologies, and even compete for the Leaderboards. But It also has an Academy, if you need to review your knowledge or learn new concepts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub.com</a> provides materials allowing anyone to gain practical hands-on experience with digital security, computer applications, and network administration tasks. VulnHub offers offline virtual machines, allowing users to practice without competing with other learners. There’s no need to worry about consistent internet access, high pings, or latency. Users can set up their own private labs to practice and learn new skills.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course">PEH by tcm</a> is a 25 hours course by TCM Security, it is one of the best-paid courses you can ever get. It is recommended to have a hackthebox account before starting the course. They focus only on tools and topics that will make you successful as an ethical hacker, it is completely hands-on and covers all foundational topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="certification">Certification</h2>
<p>Once you have quite an experience in all of the above, you can decide to test your credibility and prepare for employment by getting the certifications, We will discuss below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/"> eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration
</a> is designed for students with no penetration testing experience, as shown in course content, the instructor’s mode of teaching, and the lab modules. The course teaches about practical skill-sets that are important to penetration testing such as networking knowledge, scripting/programming, vulnerability identification, etc. It has a fairly great structure and is delivered in the easiest way to understand. Although you can proceed to the certification without the course, it is still very recommended you take the course.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/OSCP/">Offensive Security Certified Professional</a>  is an ethical hacking certification offered by Offensive Security that teaches penetration testing methodologies and the use of the tools included with the Kali Linux distribution (successor of BackTrack). The OSCP is a hands-on penetration testing certification, requiring holders to successfully attack and penetrate various live machines in a safe lab environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ecpptv2-certification/">eLearnSecurity’s Certified Professional Penetration Tester</a>  is a comprehensive, “black box” engagement against a given scope. You have seven days to complete the engagement, and another seven days to complete a professional penetration test report. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.offensive-security.com/courses-and-certifications/">Offensive Security Certified Expert</a>  is a 48-hour lab examination that will thoroughly test you on web exploitation, Windows exploit development, anti-virus evasion, x86 assembly, handcrafting shellcode, and more</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/">Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)</a>  is a qualification obtained by demonstrating knowledge of assessing the security of computer systems by looking for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems, using the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cyber Security is one of the most expensive fields, You are required to do a number of exams and certification. Unlike Software Development, These certifications are very crucial, They are more or less like a "Get out of jail free" Card.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming this far with me, I might be writing soon on preparatory exams for the above certifications</p>

		<p>I’ve written before about predatory scientific journals: those fly-by-night venues that will publish nearly any submitted paper, however dreadful. Their motive is to get the thousands of dollars in “publication fees” that authors are forced to pay. In return, the authors get to cite their paper on their c.v.s, even though most papers in these journals are worthless. (Those who evaluate c.v.s, however, often don’t know which journals are bogus.)</p>
<p><a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/04/16/hoax-a-crazy-hilarious-paper-in-a-predatory-journal/">In April of last year</a> I wrote about a hilarious and deliberately insane paper written by Daniel Baldassare, “What’s the deal with birds?”, published in the predatory <em>Scientific Journal of Research and Reviews</em> (it’s not there any longer).&nbsp; Its thesis, such as it was, was that birds tending to look like fish (i.e., penguins) occurred in areas most susceptible to climate change, while birds with weird beaks (i.e;, parrots), didn’t live in those areas. But it was a farrago of madness and humor, done on purpose to show that these journals will publish anything. Here are the “data” from Baldassare’s paper:</p>

<p>I guess after Baldassare exposed both the paper and the journal <a href="https://twitter.com/evornithology/status/1245817707024592898">in his Twitter thread</a>, they decided to remove the paper. Baldassare, by the way, managed to bargain the “author’s fee” down from $1700 to zero. <em><a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/whats-deal-birds-new-paper-ask">Audubon Magazine</a></em> even wrote a piece about the hoax.</p>
<p>Now we have another of these hoax papers, also dealing with “fishy” birds. <a href="https://juniperpublishers.com/ofoaj/">This one</a>, published by Martin Stervander and Danny Haelewaters, appears in&nbsp;in <em>Oceanography &amp; Fisheries. </em>It’s&nbsp;still up (click on the screenshot), but won’t be for long (I have a pdf for you if it’s taken down).</p>

<p>The premise and thesis is also bull-goose loony, again on purpose. This time their complex hypothesis took into account no fewer than four biological factors. Here’s how the authors describe the genesis of the hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time we developed the original idea about fishiness of birds potentially being correlated to absence of poisonous mushrooms, one of the authors (D.H.) was eating pizza with four cheeses, chicken, anchovies, and mushrooms. It was really a good one, and this prompted us to—just like the pizza—integrate all four parameters in this study: fishiness, birdiness, lack of fungal toxicity, and effects of prolonged heating. We note that integrative taxonomy approaches [8], and by extension approaches to integrate everything in research, are being increasingly employed, thus supporting the rationale for the work presented in this paper.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that research has not always been this integrative, or cross-disciplinary. For example, Charles Darwin worked alone [9] and still published a relatively well-cited contribution to the field of theology and some other disciplines. We feel it is natural for humans to dangle up and down between extremes. This is true for scientists, just like it is for politicians (consider the formation of the European Union in the 1990s and early 2000s versus the current wish of some countries to leave again [10]).</p>
<p>All in all, in this study we present the results of our work with fishy birds (<i>fide Baldassarre</i>&nbsp;[1]). We hypothesize that, (1) despite climate change, it is still cold in Antarctica and thus the presumed lack of poisonous fungi leads to fishy-looking birds. Further, with a clear correlation of pizza and lower latitudes [11], we hypothesize that (2) birdy-looking birds (as well as fishy-looking fish) will be more prevalent than fishy-looking birds on pizzas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any good reviewer would have spotted this in an instant as a Poe, but of course these journals don’t care about quality, or even seriousness. I doubt the reviewers even read the papers.</p>
<p>Their results, like Baldassari’s are presented in a single bizarre figure, with lots of bogus statements in the text about statistical methods and significance. But what they conclude is that birds that look like fish (i.e., penguins) tend to occur in areas without poisonous fungi (Antarctica), while birds that don’t look like fish (chickens, swifts, etc; they also threw in a flying fish that looks like a swift, an anchovy, and a “Nemo fish”) live at lower latitudes where there’s an abundance of pizza. A remarkable vindication of their thesis! The results in graphic form:</p>

<p>. . .&nbsp; and in the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our PCA revealed that most of the variation in the dataset was partitioned along the first (59.3%) and second (34.8%) principal components (PCs), with loadings corresponding to poisonous funginess and pizza toppingness, respectively (Table 1). There is a clear bimodality in both PC scores, distinguishing on the one hand penguins (PC1, low funginess) and on the other hand anchovy and chicken (PC2, high toppingness). Plotting the scores for all taxa, a quadratic model explains the two-dimensional distribution of avian species (p &lt;&lt;&lt; 0.05) with low residual variation except for the outlier&nbsp;<i>H. rustica</i>&nbsp;(Figure 1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They note that while fishy-looking birds occur in areas lacking poisonous fungi&nbsp;<em>and</em> pizza, that relationship doesn’t hold for birdy-looking fish (flying fish).&nbsp; They also note that the swallow is an outlier.</p>
<p>In the discussion they take up the parlous subject of climate change, and postulate that, with global warming, poisonous fungi may invade Antarctica and “may thus exert a strong selection pressure on penguins to evolve a less fishy morphology,” so that the evolved penguins may, with their new appearance, expand into “pizza topping habitats.”</p>
<p>There are two more immediate clues that this was a hoax: the acknowledgements (which damn predatory journals!) and the author contributions, which cite Darwin:</p>

<p>First author Martin Stervander also wrote <a href="https://www.stervander.com/fishy-birds-birdy-fish-poisonous-fungi-and-pizza-our-scientific-breakthroughs-published-in-predatory-journal/">an exposé on his own website</a> about the paper, including a positive “review” of the paper for another journal where it was submitted, <em>Journal of Ecosystems and Ecography</em>, published by OMICS International. It’s clear that the reviewing process of all these journals is deficient—to say the least. But if it was rigorous, they’d have no way to make money!</p>

<p>So we have another exposé of&nbsp; predatory journals, which we all know exist because every scientist gets daily requests for submissions to these journals, even when the journals aren’t remotely connected with the scientist’s research. (I’ve had pleas for my papers from journals in obstetrics and gynecology.) But there’s no better way to expose this nonsense than to publish a loony paper in it.&nbsp; Sadly, this doesn’t bring down the journals (they just remove the papers), and they continue to serve as citations for desperate scientists.</p>
<p>Is there anything unethical about these hoaxes? Hell, no: there’s no way anybody could be deceived by papers like these, and it’s the best way to show the journals up for what they are.</p>
<p>They also resemble the “hoax papers” sent by Boghossian, Pluckrose, and Lindsay to social-science journals in the famous “grievance studies affair” that now has<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair"> its own <em>Wikipedia</em> page</a>. As I wrote last April:</p>
<blockquote><p>One final remark. In the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair">grievance studies affair</a>“, Helen Pluckrose, James Lindsay, and especially Peter Boghossian got into big trouble for “hoaxing” humanities journals with equally ludicrous papers.&nbsp; Baldassarre won’t get into trouble (and shouldn’t), for his paper is in a clearly predatory journal.&nbsp; But what’s the difference between a predatory scientific journal that will publish nonsense and humanities journals like&nbsp;<em>Fat Studies</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Gender, Place &amp; Culture</em>&nbsp;that publish nonsense but also purport to be venues for serious research? In effect, they both do the same thing: help researchers fatten their c.v.s with worthless research. Why should Boghossian et al. be excoriated for exposing the same kind of crappy journal standards that Baldassarre did?</p>
<p><em>Anything</em>&nbsp;that exposes this kind of academic garbage, including clear hoax papers, is to be applauded, so long as the hoaxes are revealed (as they were with the Grievance Studies Trio) or are so palpably ridiculous (as with Baldassarre’s paper) that they couldn’t be anything&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;than a hoax.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

            <h2>Centralized silos are never the solution</h2>
            <p>Signal is possibly the most recommended pro-privacy instant
communication app — one that was commonplace in the hacker community,
and has now gained a lot of mainstream traction, thanks to WhatsApp
deciding to screw its userbase over. It certainly presents a more
compelling alternative than others in the same space, like WhatsApp
itself, Telegram, etc. They engineered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol" rel="nofollow">Signal
Protocol</a>, which has
found its way into other messaging systems, and has been the base for
the likes of OMEMO and Matrix.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> While I admire the tech behind
Signal, I still believe we can do better, and we ought to.</p>

<p>I have a few gripes with Signal — the biggest of them all is it’s
centralized, and in the US no less. This alone makes it not that
different from WhatsApp — we’re simply moving from one silo to another.
What’s to say that Signal will uphold its values, continue operating
<em>and</em> evade censorship and potential compromise? To top it off, they’re
becoming a fairly high value target off late. And if that isn’t
convincing enough, Signal’s massive outage lasting nearly a day<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
should be enough evidence against centralization. Further, Signal is
known to use AWS<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> as their cloud provider — what if another
Parler<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> happens and the rug is pulled from under Signal’s feet?</p>

<p>A common defense in favor of Signal is, “But it’s all open source!”.
Sure is, but on what basis do I trust them? I don’t mean to sound
conspiratorial, but what’s to say that the server in production hasn’t
been backdoored? In fact, the <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server" rel="nofollow">Signal server
code</a> hasn’t even been
updated since April 2020. You’re telling me it’s undergone <em>no</em> changes?</p>

<p>Another response I usually see is “But Signal is all we have!”. While
that is somewhat true — at least by the metric of “secure messengers
your granny can use”, there are some promising alternatives who are
especially focused on decentralizing E2EE communications.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow">Matrix</a>: Matrix has improved a whole lot, and I
like that they’re working to disprove that end-to-end encryption
cannot be decentralized<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</li>
<li><a href="https://getsession.org/" rel="nofollow">Session</a>: While it involves some cryptoshit,
and hasn’t been verified yet, it’s an interesting alternative to keep
an eye out for.</li>
</ol>

<p>All things said, Signal is the shiniest turd we have — it fits most
threat models, and does the job alright; I will continue to use it.
However, here’s something to think about: while privacy preserving tech
is commendable, does it have to come at the cost of user freedoms? Hint:
it doesn’t, and it shouldn’t.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018 Bryan Cantrill gave a brilliant talk where he shared his recent
experiences with the Rust programming language. More profoundly, he
explored a facet of software that is oftentimes overlooked: the <em>values</em> of
the software we use. To paraphrase him slightly:</p><blockquote><p><em>Values</em> are defined as <em>expressions of relative importance</em>. Two things that
we’re comparing could both be good attributes. The real question is, when
you have to make a choice between two of them, what do you choose? That
choice that you make, reflects your core values.</p></blockquote><p>He goes ahead to contrast the core values of some programming languages with
the core values we demand from systems software, like operating system
kernels, file systems, microprocessors, and so on. It is a really good talk
and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">watch it</a>.</p><blockquote><p>It is important to think about values because they are <em>core to the
decisions that we make</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Unlike systems software, the values demanded from text editors or IDEs vary
greatly depending on who you ask. These are much more personal tools and
make room for a diverse set of desires.</p><p>The following listing enumerates values that could be attributed to
development tools.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Value</th><th>Commentary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Approachability</strong></td><td>Ease of getting started with for typical tasks, and contribution friendliness</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Doing one thing well</strong></td><td>Unix philosophy, fitting into an ecosystem</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Editing efficiency</strong></td><td>Fewer interactions, mnemonics, composable keystrokes, etc.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Extensibility</strong></td><td>The degree to which behavior and appearance can be changed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Freedom</strong></td><td>Embraces <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free</a> software, rejects proprietary software</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Integration</strong></td><td>Cohesive core and concerted third-party functionality</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Introspectability</strong></td><td>Capable of being understood and inspected ad-hoc</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Keyboard centrism</strong></td><td>Focus on keyboard interactions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maintainability</strong></td><td>The degree to which it can be modified without introducing faults</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Progressiveness</strong></td><td>A measure of eagerness to make progress and leverage modern technology</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stability</strong></td><td>Things that worked before continue to work the same way</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text centrism</strong></td><td>Text as a universal interface</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Velocity</strong></td><td>Short and focused release cycles, aligned personpower, leveraging the community effectively</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p>Before we go any further, I'd like to point that out if you care about
any of the topics discussed ahead you will likely strongly disagree
with something or the other.</p><p>That's fine! We probably just have different values.</p></div><p>In my view, Emacs has the following core values:</p><p><strong>Emacs</strong></p><ul><li>Extensibility</li><li>Freedom</li><li>Introspectability</li><li>Keyboard centrism</li><li>Stability</li><li>Text centrism</li></ul><p>We can feel the clasp of <em>stability</em> in the following—rather
poetic—exchange in the Emacs development mailing list, which also provides
useful historical perspectives.</p><blockquote><p>Emacs is older than the operating systems people use today. (It is almost
as old as the first Unix, which barely resembled the Unix of later
decades.) It is much older than Linux, the kernel.</p><p>The oldest design elements were not designed for the uses we make of them
today. And since we wrote those, people have developed other areas of
software which don’t fit Emacs very well. So there are good reasons to
redesign some of them.</p><p>However, people actually use Emacs, so a greatly incompatible change in
Emacs is as unthinkable as a greatly incompatible change in the New York
City subway.</p><p>We have to build new lines through the maze of underground pipes and
cables.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-09/msg00607.html">Richard Stallman in “Re: Discoverability (was: Changes for 28)” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>The following exchange reifies <em>freedom</em> and <em>stability</em> while demonstrating a
disinclination to <em>progressiveness</em>. Which is neither good nor bad; it’s just
what it is.</p><blockquote><p>If Emacs was to become a “modern” app tomorrow, an editor extended in Lisp
still only has appeal for a minority of programmers, much like the Lisp
language itself. Most programmers looking for easy and modern experiences
will likely stick with Atom and Sublime.</p><p>Most of the push for a “modern look” comes from the desire for Emacs to
play more nicely with proprietary platforms. Rather, the goal of Emacs is
to support platforms like GNU/Linux. Platforms that respect your freedom,
and also do not push a corporate UI/UX vision of “modernity”.</p><p>(Perhaps if we do move forward with modernization, we should think of
modernization in the context of something like GNOME rather than MacOS or
Windows. Surely Emacs could be a better citizen of GNOME.)</p><p>Given that many of the people complaining about “how Emacs looks” are not
submitting patches to fix the problem themselves, resources would be
diverted from actual functionality to “modernity”.</p><p>By the time we do major code refactoring “modernizing” Emacs on the major
proprietary platforms, what is “modern” has now once again changed, and our
resources were put towards a project with a poor return on investment.</p><p>Basically, I don’t see a “modernizing” project playing out well. We will
spend extensive time and energy on a moving target, and even if we succeed,
our Lisp-based vision still has limited appeal. Additionally, I don’t think
“modernizing” Emacs advances the cause of free software, given that there
are other more popular casual libre tools for text editing that individuals
can use.</p><p>— <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/emacs-devel/863691n4xl.wl-me%40enzu.ru/">Ahmed Khanzada in “Re: Why is emacs so square?” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>Core values are self-reinforcing. They attract like-minded people, who
will then defend them.</p><p>I’m an Emacs user, and reading the Emacs mailing lists serves to remind me
that my values are very different from the values held by maintainers and
core contributors. I don’t value <em>freedom</em> or <em>stability</em> nearly as strongly
and have an inner affinity for <em>progressiveness</em> and <em>velocity</em>.</p><p>One part of valuing progressiveness is constantly re-evaluating: is our
current process or technology as good as it could be? What could be
improved? How do we measure improvement? How are others solving these
problems? Were there any advances in our area that we could leverage?</p><p>* * *</p><p>Now let’s talk about Vim. I see Vim as intersecting with a few of Emacs’
values, but ultimately diverging radically with its narrow focus on
providing really efficient editing capabilities.</p><p><strong>Vim</strong></p><ul><li>Doing one thing well</li><li>Editing efficiency</li><li>Keyboard centrism</li><li>Stability</li><li>Text centrism</li></ul><p>One might notice that <em>extensibility</em> is not in the list. That’s
intentional. Vim is certainly extensible to a degree, but it just does not
compare to Emacs. Vim <em>has</em> a “plugin system”, while Emacs <em>is</em> the system.
Your code becomes part of it the moment it’s evaluated. Since I’m sticking
to <em>yes/no</em> indicators for values I’m giving it a <em>no</em>.</p><p><em>Stability</em> emanates from communications with the primary maintainer.</p><blockquote><p>Vim development is slow, it’s quite stable and still there are plenty of
bugs to fix. Adding a new feature always means new bugs, thus hardly any
new features are going to be added now. I did add a few for Vim 7.3, and
that did introduce quite a few new problems. Even though several people
said the patch worked fine.</p><p>— <a href="http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Scrolling-screen-lines-I-knew-it-s-impossible-td3358342.html#a3359206">Bram Moolenar in “Re: Scrolling screen lines, I knew, it’s impossible.”
(2011)</a></p></blockquote><p>And of course in this famous exchange in a QA session.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>How can the community ensure that the Vim project succeeds for the
foreseeable future?</p></blockquote><p>Keep me alive.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.binpress.com/vim-creator-bram-moolenaar-interview/">Bram Moolenaar in “10 Questions with Vim’s creator” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>At the end of 2013, a few folks were trying to get new concurrency
primitives merged into Vim. This would empower plugin authors to create
entirely new types of functionality and by extension, make Vim better.</p><p>This is what one of them had to say about the process:</p><blockquote><p>The author of Neovim (Thiago de Arruda) tried to add support for
multi-threaded plugins to Vim and has been stymied.</p><p>I’m not sure how to get a patch merged into Vim. Bram Moolenar is the only
person with commit access, and he’s not a fan of most changes beyond bug
fixes. My co-founder and I tried to add setTimeout &amp; setInterval to
vimscript. Even six weeks of full-time effort and bending over backwards
wasn’t enough. Eventually we were just ignored.</p><p>I’ve contributed to a lot of open source projects, and the Vim community
has been the most difficult to work with. I’ve been writing C for almost
two decades, and the Vim codebase is the worst C I’ve ever seen. The
project is definitely showing its age, and I’d love for something new to
replace it.</p><p>— <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7279358">Geoff Greer in “Neovim (HN)” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>While they understood that some of their values were ultimately
incompatible with the values of the Vim maintainers—who prioritized
<em>stability</em>—they still tried to push for a change, because they treasured
the <em>idea of Vim</em>, embodied by some of its values.</p><p>It didn’t happen, so a Vim fork came to life: Neovim.</p><p>The vision was grand, and is summarized in a statement of its values:</p><blockquote><p>Neovim is a Vim-based text editor engineered for <em>extensibility</em> and
<em>usability</em>, to encourage new applications and contributions.</p><p><a href="https://neovim.io/charter/">neovim.io/charter</a></p></blockquote><p>Some of their concrete plans included</p><ul><li>improving testing, tooling, and CI to simplify maintenance, make
aggressive refactorings possible, and greatly reduce contributor friction</li><li>decoupling the core from the UI, making it possible to embed the Vim core
into browsers or IDEs (or any computer program really), also making way
for more powerful and diverse GUIs</li><li>embedding a Lua runtime and providing concurrency primitives to open the
doors for smoother, more efficient, and powerful plugins</li><li>extensive refactoring: bringing C code to modern standards (C99,
leveraging new compiler features), replacing platform-specific IO code
with libuv, removing support for legacy systems and compilers, including
automatic formatting, and fixing static analysis warnings and errors</li><li>creating a scriptable terminal emulator</li></ul><p>And they delivered it.</p><p>In a very short amount of time they were able to, and I don’t use this word
lightly, <em>revolutionize</em> Vim. The impact can be seen in Vim development,
which picked up considerably as Neovim gained ground, with features and
processes ending up being reimplemented in Vim.</p><div><p>And they aren't stopping there. Current plans include:</p><ul><li>translating all Vimscript to Lua under the hood, increasing execution
performance due to leveraging LuaJIT, a very, very fast runtime</li><li>shipping a built-in LSP client</li></ul></div><p>Neovim builds upon Vim, and the way I see it, holds the following core
values:</p><p><strong>Neovim</strong></p><ul><li>Approachability</li><li>Editing efficiency</li></ul></div></div>

To update the list with accounts to log into, click <em>I forgot my password</em> and then return to the main screen.</p><h2 id="bypassing-the-lock-screen"> <a href="#bypassing-the-lock-screen">Bypassing the lock screen</a></h2><p>First, we select the “I have forgotten my password/PIN” option. This option launches an additional session, with an account that gets created/deleted as needed; the user profile service calls it a default-account. It will have the first available name of defaultuser1, defaultuser100000, defaultuser100001, etc.</p><p>To escape the lock, we have to use the Narrator because if we manage to launch something, we cannot see it, but using the Narrator, we will be able to navigate it. However, how do we launch something?</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/bitlockerbypass/1.png" alt=""></p><p>If we smash shift 5 times in quick succession, a link to open the Settings app appears, and the link actually works. We cannot see the launched Settings app. Giving the launched app focus is slightly tricky; you have to click the link and then click a place where the launched app would be visible with the correct timing. The easiest way to learn to do it is, keep clicking the link roughly 2 times a second. The sticky keys windows will disappear. Keep clicking! You will now see a focus box is drawn in the middle of the screen. That was the Settings app, and you have to stop clicking when it gets focus.</p><p>Now we can navigate the Settings app using CapsLock + Left Arrow, press that until we reach Home. Now, when Home has focus, hold down Caps Lock and press Enter. Using CapsLock + Right Arrow navigate to Devices and CapsLock + Enter when it is in focus.</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/bitlockerbypass/2.png" alt=""></p><p>Now navigate to AutoPlay, CapsLock + Enter and choose “Open Folder to view files (File Explorer).” Now insert the prepared USB drive, wait some seconds, the Narrator will announce the drive has been opened, and the window is focused. Now select the file <strong>Exploit.exe</strong> and execute it with CapsLock + Enter. That is arbitrary code execution, ladies and gentlemen, without using any passwords. However, we are limited by running as the default profile.</p><p>I have made a video with my phone, as I cannot take screenshots.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdsSgklRoag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2 id="elevation-of-privilege"> <a href="#elevation-of-privilege">Elevation of privilege</a></h2><p>When a USB stick is mounted, BitLocker will create a directory named ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation in System Volume Information and set permissions to:</p><div><div><pre><code>NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(F)

We can now use the link created in <code>RPC Control</code>. Unplug the USB stick and reinsert it. The writeable directory will be created in <code>System32</code>; on the next loop iteration, the payload will get planted, and exploit.exe will exit. To test if the exploit has been successful, close the Narrator and try to start it again.</p><p>If the narrator does not work, it is because the DLL is planted, and Narrator executes it, but it fails to add an account because it is launched as <code>defaultuser1</code>. When the payload is planted, you will need to click back to the login screen and start Narrator; 3 beeps should play, and a message box saying the DLL has been loaded as <code>SYSTEM</code> should show. Great! The account has been created, but it is not in the list.

			<p>At least a significant portion of their supporters, according to U of Aarhus researchers.</p>
<p>When two competing political parties in Denmark reversed their policy stance on an issue — suddenly they both supported reducing unemployment benefits — their voters immediately moved their opinions by around 15% into line with their party.</p>
<p>The same thing happened when one of these parties shifted from opposing to supporting ending Denmark’s early retirement.</p>
<p>The researchers were studying how public opinion is formed. Their recent paper sheds light on how much influence political parties have over their supporters, according to the researchers, who surveyed their panel of subjects in five successive waves between 2010 and 2011. They studied the same group of party supporters before, during and after a policy reversal.</p>
<p>“We can see that [the] welfare programs were actually quite popular … and many of the voters of the center-right party were in favor of these welfare programs,” commented one of the researchers, Rune Slothuus. “Nevertheless, we can see that they reversed their opinion from supporting these welfare programs to opposing these welfare programs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was surprised to see the parties appeared this powerful in shaping opinions,” Slothuus said. “Our findings suggest that partisan leaders can indeed lead citizens’ opinions in the real world, even in situations where the stakes are real and the economic consequences tangible.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers pondered Western democracy in light of their findings: “If citizens just blindly follow their party without thinking much about it, that should lead to some concern about the mechanisms in our democracy. Because how can partisan elites represent citizens’ views if the views of citizens are shaped by the very same elites who are supposed to represent them?”</p>

    <h3>The brain listens for things it is trying to predict</h3>
    <div><p>The brain interprets sounds as they contrast with its expectations; it recognizes patterns of sounds faster when they’re in line with what it is predicting it will hear, but it only encodes sounds when they contrast with expectations, according to <span>Technische U researchers. </span></p>
<p>The researchers showed this by monitoring the two principal nuclei of the subcortical pathway responsible for auditory processing: the inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, as their subjects listened to patterns of sounds which the researches modified so that sometimes they would hear an expected sound pattern, and other times something unexpected.</p>

    <h3>We have a particular way of understanding a room</h3>
    <div><p>When several research subjects were instructed to explore an empty room, and when they were instead seated in a chair and watched someone else explore the room, their brain waves followed a certain pattern, as recorded by a backpack hooked up to record their brain waves, eye movements, and paths. It didn’t matter if they were walking or watching someone else, according to UC researchers led by Dr Matthias Stangl.</p>
<p>The researchers also tested what happened when subjects searched for a hidden spot, or watched someone else do so, and found that brain waves flowed more strongly when they had a goal and hunted for something.</p>

    <h3>Extroverts and introverts use different vocabularies</h3>
    <div><p>Extroverts use ‘positive emotion’ and ‘social process’ words more often than introverts, according to new research conducted at <span>Nanyang Technological U</span>.</p>
<p>‘Love,’ ‘happy,’ and ‘blessed’ indicate pleasant emotions, and ‘beautiful’ and ‘nice’ indicate positivity or optimism, and are among the words found to be used more often by extroverts. So too are ‘meet,’ ‘share,’ and ‘talk,’ which are about socializing. Extroverts use personal pronouns — except ‘I’ — more too, another indication of sociability.</p>
<p>The correlation, however, was small, and the researchers think that stronger linguistic indicators need to be found to achieve their general goal, which is improving machine learning approaches to targeting consumer marketing.</p>

    <h3>WhatsApp is changing today - Users must give the app permission to send their private data to Facebook or lose account</h3>
    <div><p>WhatsApp was bought by Facebook in 2014, but has thrived while promoting itself as a privacy-respecting messaging app that now has 1.5b monthly active users. This week, though, WhatApp sent out an update to users’ phones that they must ‘consent’ to a new policy or lose access.</p>
<p>Whatsapp will now share more of your data, including your IP address (your location) and phone number, your account registration information, your transaction data, and service-related data, interactions on WhatsApp, and other data collected based on your consent, with Facebook’s other companies. Facebook has been working towards more closely integrating Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.</p>
<p>Users who do not agree to ‘consent’ to the new policy will see their WhatsApp account become inaccessible until they do ‘consent.’ These accounts will remain dormant for 120 days after which they will be ‘deleted.’</p>
<p>The biggest change to the user policy, which many people ignored and clicked ‘agree’ to, thinking it was just another unimportant app update message, now reads,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, “about” information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your “last seen”); and when you last updated your “about” information.’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, Elon Musk tweeted on the news, saying that WhatsApp users should switch to Signal, one of several popular privacy-focused messaging apps similar to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The data sharing policy change doesn’t affect people in Europe due to GDPR data protection regulations.</p>

    <h3>President Trump silenced on top social media platforms after mob storms Capitol</h3>
    <div><p>The US president was locked out from posting new messages on his Facebook and Twitter accounts after an unruly group of supporters assembled outside the capitol building where Biden’s election win was being confirmed.</p>
<p>The lockdown on Twitter lasted 12 hours until the president removed tweets Twitter said violated its ‘civic integrity policy,’ but Zuckerburg said that Trump would be silenced on Facebook and Instagram for at least two more weeks until his presidential term was over. Facebook and Twitter are two of the main ways the president communicates with citizens and the world.</p>
<p>It is the first time social media platforms have chosen to limit the free speech of such an important figure.</p>
<h6><em>Trump’s tweets from Jan 6, 2020, as recorded by thetrumparchive.com</em></h6>


<p>Many news organizations covered the story using language such as <a href="https://thespeakernewsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Trump-Incites-Rioters.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1324866489" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="15093_15041">‘Trump Incites Rioters.’</a></p>
<p>Following Trumps ‘ban,’ there was renewed talk about treating social media platforms, where people share informative content, as publishers themselves, in part because their algorithms amplify things shared when those things are engaging. There was also talk about how the social media platforms that censored the president’s content did so as a response to content or events but without first drawing their ‘red line’ and saying which content is and isn’t allowed on their platforms.</p>
<p>Some of Trump’s staff resigned following the incident at the Capitol building, and there were also a lot of questions why the national guard wasn’t capable of handling the incident properly.</p>
<p>UPDATE January 8: Twitter permanently banned Trump’s account. Google removed Parler, an app like Twitter used by Trump supporters, from the Android app store to make it harder for people to download it, saying Google requires social media apps to have content moderation policies to remove posts that incite violence.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>the below does not explain what Gemini is, but <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">this does</a></strong></p>

<p>Reading people’s gemlogs, I get a sense of a smaller internet. I stumble across an article about Pacific Northwest seaweed, a list of types. Someone else writes her thoughts: “Really, prepare to question groupthink”. A history of adoptable cyberpets. It is addicting to read people’s neat summaries of interests, ascii art embellishments.</p>

<p>But something about it makes me sad.</p>

<p>There’s something called the Eternal September, about how – well, should I be pretending to tell you from the position of someone who’d know? It happened the month after I was born.</p>

<p>Every September before, college students with new network access would stream onto Usenet fora without ever having accustomed themselves to the etiquette. Things would get rowdy and stupid for a while. Then they would learn or get bored and things would quiet down again.</p>

<p>That September, though, was more than just college students – America Online offered Usenet access to all its members. Ever after, the numbers would be dominated by those who had no manners, who didn’t know there was culture to learn. September continued forever.</p>

<p>The design of Gemini isn’t the community. I’m sure there are a few people who use the bridged NPR website available served via Gemini who are really in it because they’re Just That Mad About JavaScript, but those aren’t the people who make the place. It’s a bunch of people who learned a new markup language and installed some new fiddly tools and wrote their journals in plain text and taught me what seaweed is edible… why?</p>

<p>Something about Gemini strikes me as a grail quest for the Eternal August, before webscale crushed the things we love.</p>

<p>While everything I have seen served via Gemini is friendly and sociable, the technical barriers of what-is-a-command-line and how-do-I-use-one are a fence put up that keep out the riffraff. Certainly, you can walk around the corner and go through the gate, but ultimately the geminiverse is lovely because it is underpopulated, slower-paced, and literate. It is difficult enough to access that those who can use it can be welcoming without worrying its smallness will be compromised.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that I don’t think many of its denizens would claim that they <em>only</em> want to hear from technical, educated people, but in order to use a <em>small</em> internet, an August internet, they have let the fence keep out anyone else.</p>

<p>This is the part of the piece where I pivot to My Proposal to Fix Everything, right? Where I tell you about my new community or my idea for what people should be doing or if we only started using tags <em>right</em>…</p>

<p>I don’t know that I think that it’s that neat.</p>

<p>I will probably keep reading things on Gemini, keep querying its search engine for terms and being delighted by neatly crafted plain-text.</p>

<p>But I will probably keep finding it sad.</p>

January 16, 2021 | https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I recently started learning the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a> by going through <em>"<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>"</em>, which does a phenomenal job of explaining the language basics.</p>
<p>After working through the book’s main content I got started with my first non-trivial, real-world application.
But I soon found myself faced with a question I didn’t yet feel well-equipped to handle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How should you structure error handling in a mature rust application?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article describes my journey of discovering the answer to this question.
I will try to explain the pattern I’ve settled on together with example code showing its implementation, in the hope that other newcomers may have an easier time getting started.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>While the book goes through the basics of error handling, including use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> type and error propagation with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator"><code>?</code></a> operator, it largely glosses over the different patterns for using these tools in real-world applications or the trade-offs involved with different approaches. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When I began looking into best practices, I came across quite a bit of outdated advice to use the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/"><em>failure</em> crate</a>.
<em>Failure</em> had a semi-official feel to it as a result of being in the <code>rust-lang-nursery</code> namespace, but <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/pull/347">it has recently been deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>There have been a number of improvements to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html">std::error::Error</a> trait in the past two years. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
These have made <em>failure</em> less needed in general and have sparked a number of more modern libraries taking advantage of these improvements to offer better ergonomics.</p>
<p>After reading through quite a lot of historical context and evaluating a number of libraries, I’ve now settled on a (largely library-agnostic) pattern for structuring errors, which I implement using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> crates. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The rest of this article will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce a relatively trivial word-counting application to explore and explain the problem space.</li>
<li>Explain why applications and libraries should use different error-handling patterns.</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to apply these patterns using <code>anyhow</code> and <code>thiserror</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="counting-words">Counting words</h2>
<p>Let’s introduce some example code for use throughout the rest of this article.
We’ll build a program to count the number of words in a text file, much like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html">wc -w</a> would do.</p>
<p>A naive implementation with basic error handling using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> might look like this:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Let’s generate an input file for our new word counter and try to run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ fortune &gt; words.txt
$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
50 words.txt
</code></pre><p>If you don’t have a <code>words.txt</code> however, you’ll encounter the following error:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
</code></pre><p>This error is the result of <code>File::open()</code> returning an error in <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>To make the example complete, let’s also <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/36f4545f2b994f054a17ac31df07e2f762c6ac24/src/wordcounter.rs#L124-L125">simulate an error</a> in the <code>read()</code> call happening under the hood inside <code>count_words()</code> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> so we can see what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
Error: Custom { kind: BrokenPipe, error: "read: broken pipe" }
</code></pre><h3 id="missing-context">Missing context</h3>
<p>So what’s wrong with the above error?
While the underlying error cause (<em>“broken pipe”</em>) is made clear, we’re missing a lot of context.
We can’t tell which file could not be opened and there is no information about the sequence of events leading up to this error.</p>
<p>When you think about it, there’s a chain of errors here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main()</code> returns an error because <code>count_words()</code> returns an error.</li>
<li><code>count_words()</code> returns an error because we run into an error iterating over <code>reader.lines()</code> (lines 14-15).</li>
<li>Iterating over <code>reader.lines()</code> errors because we injected an implementation of <code>std::io::Read</code> that fails on the first call to <code>read()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we don’t really see this reflected in the error messages above.</p>
<p>In this example the file name is an input argument for the program itself.
This makes it easy to correlate the error to the file it was trying to open.</p>
<p>Now imagine an error happening 5 calls deep inside a library within a much larger piece of software.
Without any information on the chain of events in such a case, it quickly gets very difficult to understand what might be causing the error.</p>
<h2 id="libraries-versus-applications">Libraries versus applications</h2>
<p>Earlier on I mentioned <strong>two</strong> different libraries, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> (though both are by the same author, <a href="https://rustaceans.org/search/dtolnay">dtolnay</a>).
You might be wondering why we need two separate libraries to do something as basic as dealing with errors.</p>
<p>It took me a moment to appreciate this distinction, but there’s value in approaching error handling differently between libraries and applications as they tend to have different concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries should focus on <em>producing</em> meaningful, structured error types/variants.
This allows applications to easily differentiate various error cases.</li>
<li>Applications mainly <em>consume</em> errors.</li>
<li>Libraries may want to cast errors from one type to another.
An IO error should likely be wrapped by a high-level error type provided by the library.
<ul>
<li>Otherwise an IO error in library <code>foo</code> cannot be distinguished from a similar IO error in library <code>bar</code>.</li>
<li>Not doing so also requires the consumer to know library internals.
For example, is it just IO errors that might be returned? What about HTTP errors that might originate from an HTTP client internal to the library?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libraries must be careful when changing errors or creating new errors, as these can easily introduce breaking changes for consumers.
They may produce new errors internally, but these are unlikely to require special structure and can be more easily changed at will.</li>
<li>Where libraries return errors, applications decide if and how those errors are formatted and displayed to users.</li>
<li>Applications may also want to parse and inspect errors, for example to forward them to exception tracking services or to retry operations when doing so is deemed to be safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, and I think this is quite important, <strong>libraries should always use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> together with an error type implementing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html">std::error::Error</a> in their public APIs</strong>.
Custom result types like <a href="https://docs.rs/failure/0.1.8/failure/trait.Fail.html">failure::Fail</a> may not compose well with other parts of your user’s code and force them to learn yet another library.</p>
<h3 id="api-boundaries">API boundaries</h3>
<p>Coming back to our word counting example, imagine we want to make <code>count_words</code> available as a public library.
You wouldn’t normally do this for such a small and simple piece of code, but there can be value in making functionality available through public crates within larger projects.</p>
<p>As a demonstration, we can define boundaries in our word counter to separate this code into a library and an application part.</p>
<p>We’ll extract <code>count_words</code> into a <em>library crate</em> named <em>wordcounter</em>.
I’ll highlight relevant parts below, but if you want to skip ahead, you can find the complete <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/wordcounter.rs">src/wordcounter.rs</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Everything outside of <code>count_words</code> is our application code.
This is going to live in a <em>binary crate</em> which we’ll call <em>rwc</em> (for <em>Rust Word Count</em> — very original, I know).
The relevant files for this are <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/main.rs">src/main.rs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/lib.rs">src/lib.rs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-library-error-type">The library error type</h3>
<p>For our <em>wordcounter</em> library, we’ll define a top-level error type called <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/36db340c9beaf14032c93f63afcb413f99ec3291/src/wordcounter.rs#L23-L38">WordCountError</a>.
This enum has error variants for every possible error that our library might encounter.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> comes into play.
While we could implement this by hand, <em>thiserror</em> allows us to avoid writing lots of boilerplate code:</p>

This computer has no microprocessor.  The CPU is discrete TTL logic.
<p><img alt="Mark 1 FORTH Computer" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Rack1_40.jpg" width="900" height="500">
</p><p>I bought my first TTL data book in 1979.
I was learning 6502 machine code at the time and dreamt of building a simple TTL CPU.
I sketched some circuit ideas; but that was as far as it went.
Now, 25 years later, I've finally done it!
Working evenings and weekends, the Mark 1 took a month to design, 4 months to build and a month to program.
Here's the result:</p><p>
<img alt="Recursive factorial demo" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Factorial.gif" width="652" height="331">
</p><p>
<b><tt>Myself</tt></b> is a standard way to implement recursion in FORTH.
Even if you're not familiar with FORTH, if I tell you it's a stack-based language, and uses reverse polish notation (RPN), you might be able to figure out how this works.

<h3>µ-Instruction Format</h3>

<p>
The Mark 1 is a micro-programmed machine with a highly encoded "vertical" microcode.
The microinstruction (µ) is only 8-bits wide.
One normally thinks in terms of "horizontal" microcodes, which are wider and less encoded.
Some are very wide indeed.
The Mark 1 is more like a RISC processor.
</p>

<p>The 8-bit µ-instruction (µ) is encoded as follows:</p>

<small>TOS = Top of parameter stack; R = Top of return stack</small>

<p>The Mark 1 executes 1 µ-instruction per clock cycle (1MHz).</p>

<p>Decoding is done centrally using 74HC138 1-of-8 decoders.
Decoded control signals are distributed via the back plane.
Simple gating is then required at card level to complete the decoding.</p>

<p>The conditional is a skip not a branch.
It inhibits loading of another µ-instruction for a specified number of cycles if the test is true.
The skip distance is decremented to zero at which point normal execution resumes.</p>

<p>The "µPC←OP*16" instruction (1011xxxx) a.k.a. XOP loads the uppermost 8-bits of the program counter (µPC) from the operand register.
It's a form of indirect jump.</p>

<p>The other jump instruction (1001xxxx) has a 4-bit operand and can only reach the first 16 bytes of the µ-ROM.</p>

<p>
The 74181-based ALU requires 8 control signals.
These are decoded from the 4-bit ALU function field in the µ-instruction using a 7x16 diode matrix ROM.
The shaded squares indicate positions where diodes are fitted:</p>

<p>FLAG selects sign or overflow testing.
Sign testing routes the most significant bit of the ALU result to the conditional test multiplexer.
Overflow testing required the addition of a quad-XOR gate.
The 74181 does not generate an overflow signal (the later 382 variant does).
This was not used in the end because FORTH implements signed comparison by testing the sign of the result after subtraction.</p>

<h3>Backplane</h3>

<p>The Mark 1 is housed in a 3U 19"
IEC297 sub-rack with a 64-way DIN 41612 backplane.
The bus layout is shown below.
The "A" row resembles a standard 8-bit microprocessor bus.
The "C" row carries the µ-instruction and various decoded control signals.
The fully-bussed pins (1, 2, 31, &amp; 32) carry power supply and clocks.</p>

<p>The clocks are in quadrature.
CLK1 <strike>rises</strike>falls at the beginning of the machine cycle.
CLK2 is used to generate write-enable signals for the RAM and I/O.</p>

<p>All control signals are active low.</p>

<h3>Microcode sequencer</h3>

<p>The sequencer has a 12-bit micro-program counter (µPC).
The uppermost 8-bits can be loaded from the OP Latch, effecting a jump to one of 256 microcode routines.
Each routine starts on a 16-byte µ-page boundary.</p>

<p><img width="554" height="152" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Sequencer.gif" alt="Sequencer block diagram"></p>

<p>Opcodes, the machine language of the macro-machine, are loaded into the OP latch from the data bus under
micro-program control.  They can be fetched from memory using one of the index registers as a program counter.
A simple <i>micro-interpreter</i> consists of the following 3 µ-instructions:</p>
<div><pre>OP←Memory[Index]     Load OP latch from memory
Index←Index+1        Increment "program counter"
µPC←OP*16            Execute microcode routine
</pre></div>
<p>How do these 3 µ-instructions get executed?
One possibility is to append them to the end of every µ-routine.
A slower but more space-efficient option is to append a jump to them.
Mark 1 microcode has a jump specifically for this.</p>

<h3>Virtual machine</h3>
<p>It's possible to customise the the instruction set and thereby create a "virtual machine".</p>
<p>Opcodes can have zero, one, or more operands.  
The µ-routines consume operands by incrementing the program counter.
During development, I used this two-operand POKE instruction to test the UART.
This expects a 16-bit address followed by a data byte:</p>
<div><pre>Poke:    Index.Lo ← Memory [PC]        ; Address LO
         PC ← PC+1
         Index.Hi ← Memory [PC]        ; Address HI
         PC ← PC+1
         Temp ← Memory [PC]            ; Data byte
         PC ← PC+1
         Memory [Index] ← Temp         ; Do the POKE
         Jump Next
</pre></div>
<p>The Mark 1 was designed to support the FORTH virtual machine.
The following FORTH primitives are micro-programmed:</p>

<tt>
EXIT LIT EXECUTE
BRANCH 0BRANCH (LOOP) (DO) U* U/ AND OR XOR LEAVE R&gt; &gt;R R 0= 0&lt; + D+
MINUS DMINUS OVER DROP SWAP DUP @ C@ ! C! (DOES)
</tt>

<h3>Forth model</h3>

<p>My original plan was to build a subroutine-threaded FORTH.  High-level definitions were to be called explicitly, primitives were to be compiled inline:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr><td><tt>: Foo  DUP SWAP DROP ;</tt></td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>: Bar  OVER Foo ROT ;</tt></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</td>
<td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr><td><tt>Foo:</tt></td><td><tt>DB OP_DUP, OP_SWAP, OP_DROP, OP_EXIT</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>Bar:</tt></td><td><tt>DB OP_OVER, OP_CALL</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>DW Foo</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>DB OP_ROT, OP_EXIT</tt></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I abandoned this idea because most FORTHs use indirect threading and I wanted a full-featured standard FORTH with all the usual compiler facilities.
Many compiling words are tightly coupled to the indirectly threaded model.</p>

<p>Indirectly threaded code is a list of execution tokens.
An execution token is a code field address.
The code field is a pointer to machine code.
This presented a problem on the mark 1 because it has separate macro and micro address spaces.
What should go in the code field?
My solution was to shorten it to 1 byte and store the opcode:</p>

<table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p><br><b>Subroutine-threaded</b><br>&nbsp;</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p><br><b>Indirectly-threaded</b><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to learn the math involved with the Big O, read  <a target="_blank" href="https://thatcomputerscientist.com/analysing-algorithms-worst-case-running-time">Analysing Algorithms: Worst Case Running Time</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Structures and Algorithms is about solving problems efficiently. A bad programmer solves their problems inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn't even know why their solution is inefficient. So, the question is, <em>How do you rank an algorithm's efficiency?</em></p>
<p>The simple answer to that question is the <strong>Big O Notation</strong>. How does that work? Let me explain!</p>
<p>Say you wrote a function which goes through every number in a list and adds it to a <em>total_sum</em> variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610785957976/1d53AER34.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.02.19 PM.png"></p>
<p>If you consider "addition" to be 1 operation then running this function on a list of 10 numbers will cost 10 operations, running it on a list of 20 numbers costs 20 operations  and similarly running it on a list of n numbers costs the <em>length of list</em> (n) operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610786373466/WWOOmyjH9.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="Screen Recording 2021-01-16 at 2.01.09 PM.gif"></p>
<p>Now let's assume you wrote another function that would return the first number in a list.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610786595803/WcObNzV40.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.09.39 PM.png"></p>
<p>Now, no matter how large this list is, this function will never cost more than one operation. Fairly, these two algorithms have different <strong>time complexity</strong> or <em>relationship between growth of input size and growth of operations executed</em>. We communicate these time complexities using <strong><em>Big O Notation</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to the complexities as <em>'<strong>n</strong>'</em>, common complexities (ranked from good to bad) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant - <strong>O(1)</strong></li>
<li>Logarithmic <strong>O(log n)</strong></li>
<li>Linear - <strong>O(n)</strong></li>
<li>n log n - <strong>O(n log n)</strong></li>
<li>Quadratic - <strong>O(n²)</strong></li>
<li>Exponential - <strong>O(2ⁿ)</strong></li>
<li>Factorial - <strong>O(n!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610787546688/SufUcCJVY.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.23.08 PM.png"></p>
<p>Our first algorithm runs in <em>O(n)</em>, meaning its operations grew in a linear relationship with the input size - in this case, the amount of numbers in the list. Our second algorithm is not dependent on the input size at all  - so it runs in constant time. 
Let's take a look at how many operations a program has to execute in function with an input size of <em>n = 5 vs n = 50</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td></td><td>n = 5</td><td>n = 50</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(1)</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(log n)</strong></td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n)</strong></td><td>5</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n log n)</strong></td><td>20</td><td>300</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n²)</strong></td><td>25</td><td>2500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(2ⁿ)</strong></td><td>32</td><td>1125899906842624</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n!)</strong></td><td>120</td><td>3.0414093e+64</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It might not matter when the input is small, but this gap gets very dramatic as the input size increases. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610788579877/ejJP5RkiF.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="Screen Recording 2021-01-16 at 2.33.46 PM.gif"></p>
<p>If n were 10000, a function that runs in <em>log(n)</em> would only take 14 operations and a function that runs in <em>n!</em> would set your computer on fire!</p>
<p>For Big O Notation, we <em>drop constants</em> so <em>O(10.n)</em> and <em>O(n/10)</em> are both equivalent to <em>O(n)</em> because the graph is still linear. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610788828910/JYXeRjI-G.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.47.52 PM.png"></p>
<p>Big O Notation is also used for <strong>space complexity</strong>, which works the same way - <em>how much space an algorithm uses as n grows</em> or <em>relationship between growth of input size and growth of space needed</em>.</p>
<p>So, yeah! This has been the simplest possible explanation of the Big O Notation from my side and I hope you enjoyed reading this.

Partly notes to help
clarify my understanding of something and partly for future me.</p><p>That’s why I have my <a href="https://scottspence.com/garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital garden</a>, an online collection of my
learning over the years.</p><p>What is in my garden is not the full extent of the notes I have taken
however, there’s partly formed musings and one-liners that will help
me if I ever come across this one particular thing which took a while
to fix/resolve in the past.</p><p>Stuff like that doesn’t really warrant going into a post so I have
<a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Sheets</a> where that will get added to and grouped with the
relevant information.</p><p>It’s not been until recently that I have come to learn of the
<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zettelkasten</a> method, which translates from German to note box.</p><p>With tools like RoamResearch and Notion gaining popularity and me
using many of them I’ve decided to make some notes on my opinions of
what I have been using over the years.</p><h2 id="cliffstldr"><a href="#cliffstldr" aria-label="cliffstldr permalink"></a>Cliffs/TL;DR</h2><p>I’m using a mixture of Foam and Obsidian with my data exported from
RoamResearch and Notion which I now use in a private GitHub repo that
I’m in full control of.</p><h2 id="github"><a href="#github" aria-label="github permalink"></a>GitHub</h2><p>GitHub is where it all began for me, with git being a particular
sticking point with a lot of commands that were all pretty alien at
the time so I started adding the commands <a href="https://gist.github.com/spences10/5c492e197e95158809a83650ff97fc3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a gist</a> which has a
history going back to <a href="https://gist.github.com/spences10/5c492e197e95158809a83650ff97fc3a/revisions?page=2#diff-0517f094a4805e87e00d10b2891d99e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the start of 2017</a>.</p><p>As this list started to grow I also had other areas that I needed to
keep these little one-liners to hand, git being the largest but other
things like <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/mac/#screen-snip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to screen snip</a> on macOS and <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/bash/#kill-process-on-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill a process</a> with
bash, all started adding up.</p><p>I moved them all into <a href="https://github.com/spences10/cheat-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one repository</a> for ease of access for me.
These later were added to <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Sheets</a>.xyz</p><h2 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a>Notion</h2><p>Back when Notion was the new hotness and I jumped onto it as soon as a
discovered how flexable it was and more importantly cross platform, so
I could take notes on my phone, work laptop and personal computer yay
🎉</p><p>I used it for stashing ideas for later, todo lists, shopping lists,
kanban boards and the 100s of links that I thought looked interesting
but didn’t have time to read it there and then so stashed them in the
Notion links database (never to be seen again 🤣).</p><p>Downsides, the search wasn’t great, that’s been improved in recent
iterations but was quite annoying when you wanted to find something
quickly.</p><p>The Android version just straight up stopped working, I couldn’t use
it and the general feeling from Notion was meh!</p><p>I learned the hard way about differing Markdown versions with this too
after making a 8k word post in Notion then copy pasting into VSCode to
find all the artifacts for code snippets and word formatting
throughout.</p><p>Getting my data out of Notion was straightforward enough but what I
was left with was a but of a mess. Because of the nesting you were
able to do with pages in pages the export was a mess of files with
hashes appended to them which is going to take a while to untangle.</p><h2 id="roamresearch"><a href="#roamresearch" aria-label="roamresearch permalink"></a>RoamResearch</h2><p>Roam RoamResearch was a different way of logging notes, the default
was to open you on a daily notes view where you’d add your notes and
you could then move these into more long form documents with the help
of the graph behind it which helped you link information with
backlinks (<code>[[example backlink]]</code>) with the intention of helping you
collate information from differing sources.</p><p>The odd bit was that you could only add in a bullet fashion, so if you
want to add a code block it always looked weird inline of a unordered
list.</p><p>It got a bit weird and culty, I always get a bit wary when companies
start referring to their users/employees as tribes, “Roamers”,
“Googlers”, no thanks.</p><p>That along with starting it and staring at the rotating logo for an
age waiting for it to start, not helpful when you want to take a note
quickly.</p><p>Getting my data out of there was a straightforward button click
though.</p><h2 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a>Obsidian</h2><p>Obsidian, the free (or one off licence payment) offering that is a
standalone app, much like Notion (which I know is web based too)
available on macOS, Windows and Linux.</p><p>The idea is that the notes you take are hosted locally on your
machine, no central storage location like with Notion and
RoamResearch.</p><p>With Obsidian you are in direct control of the Markdown, store it
wherever you like.</p><p>This brings up questions about how and where you store your data, I’ve
now added all the exports from Notion and RoamResearch to a git
repository which is on a private GitHub repo.</p><p>This is nice, there’s an import option for Roam exports, you can
configure your daily notes location and it has a super nice graph
view.</p><p>This experience felt a lot like working in VSCode, but it wasn’t
VSCode! 😬</p><p>I’m very comfortable with editing Markdown in VSCode and felt a bit
cheated when I couldn’t select a tab or move lines around.</p><h2 id="foam"><a href="#foam" aria-label="foam permalink"></a>Foam</h2><p>So, Foam! <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foam is a VSCode extension</a> that enables the features of
Obsidian but with the editing power of VSCode, so no brainier, right?</p><p>Foam are the first to admit that <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things may be a little rough</a> as
it’s still in preview. But I <em>really</em> like working with my Markdown in
VSCode so I’m prepared for the teething issues.</p><p>There’s a <a href="https://discord.gg/rtdZKgj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super welcoming Discord</a> to join and talk to other users
and the developers.</p><p>With my new liberated data from Notion and RoamResearch I’m in the
process of working through all this data which is easy to visualise
with the VSCode file explorer and built in graph view of Foam.</p><p>The Foam graph view is still a WIP so I’m referring to Obsidian to
check that out for now.</p><p>I’m super excited following the progress of this!</p><a href="#top-of-page" aria-label="back to top navigation"><p>Back to Top</p></a></article><div><p>If you're interested in occasional updates from me about what I'm working on and want useful information you can sign up to my newsletter.</p><p>Important dev related content, directly to your inbox (for free).</p><p><span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨</span>I'm giving away sticker packs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to a randomly chosen newsletter subscriber. 👇</p><p><a href="https://scottspence.com/newsletter">Newsletter signup...</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>For the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tomlooman.com/stanford-cs193u/" target="_blank">Stanford University Fall 2020 Curriculum</a>, I built a small game project using mainly C++ mixed with some Blueprint in Unreal Engine. For those interested, the entire Computer Science course (CS193U) was provided through Zoom lectures and has been recorded. I’m working on getting this published and meanwhile, this project is already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike" target="_blank">open-source through GitHub</a> to be taken apart by anyone! </p>

<p>The game was built with a wide set of features to cover a variety of useful coding concepts to students including AI, multiplayer programming, save games, async asset loading, etc. Check out the non-exhaustive list of features below, I’m sure there is more that I forgot to include or that will drip in at a later time.</p>
<p>Those interested in a GAS (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/GameplayAbilitySystem/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gameplay Ability System</a>) style design might be keen to check out how we handled Abilities (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SAction.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Action.h</a>) and Buffs/Debuffs (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SActionEffect.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActionEffect.h</a>) as this shares many similarities with GAS design, albeit its much simpler.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there isn’t a whole lot that makes this a real ‘roguelike’ with things like permadeath or proper RNG. But, I hope to extend this project later on with more relevant features to have a proper game loop to earn the name ‘Action Roguelike’.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Below I’ve listed some of the more relevant features included in the project. I think these code samples can be invaluable in getting an idea on how to use them in the Unreal Engine eco-system.

<p>There is still a decent chunk of features I would like to add, including adding a proper game loop, items/abilities, Steamworks, etc. Whether these will actually see the light of day depends on many factors – including the final shape of the existing course recordings.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>
