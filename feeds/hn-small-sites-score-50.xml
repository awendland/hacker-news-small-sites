<p>Hear that? It’s the sound of Mac fans. No, not your shiny new M1 Mac’s fans—chances are, you’ll never hear those—but rather, the sound of <em>excitement</em> rippling through the Mac community. This is something big. Really big. Now, I’m only 33, but someday when I go full fuddy-duddy I will speak of this: the great Intel/Apple Silicon transition. The beginning of a new era at Apple.</p>



<p>All that sounds dramatic, of course, but it’s interesting to trace all of the different paths that led us to this point. The A-Series chips, the introduction of Metal, rapid machine learning gains, the gradually degrading repairability scores as components became more integrated, the Secure Enclave, a new super fast emulation layer, new unified memory architecture, and 5nm process… years and years of work have now come to fruition with the first Apple Silicon chips for Mac. And our minds are blown.</p>



<p>Suddenly, we’re handed a thin, entry-level fanless laptop that performs better than almost every other Mac computer out there, and a low-end MacBook Pro and Mac Mini that make current Mac Pro owners sweat and clutch their wheels. So many questions abound. What new hardware designs will these gains make possible? What on earth does Apple have in store for its high-end Macs? Will anyone else even be able to compete? It’s an exciting time to be a Mac lover, but, surprise: this post isn’t really about the Mac. It’s about the iPad.</p>



<p>There’s no question that Apple has struggled to craft a cohesive, compelling narrative for the iPad. For a long time, there seemed to be a distinct lack of product vision. Everyone likes to speculate over what role Steve Jobs ultimately intended the iPad to have in people’s lives, but not only is that pointless, it’s also irrelevant. We don’t need Steve to tell us what the iPad is good for. We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it <em>could</em> be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</p>



<p>Just as Apple left us with great expectations for its Pro Mac line-up, the latest iPad Air also raises the bar in new and interesting ways. The Air served as sort of an appetizer for the new M1 chips, while also receiving a generous trickle-down of features from the iPad Pro, including USB-C and support for the latest keyboard and Pencil accessories. There have been rumors of new mini-LED displays for the next-gen iPad Pros, but it’s going to take a lot more than new display tech to set the Pros apart.</p>



<p>Francisco Tolmasky (<a href="https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1330033394349125642?s=20">@tolmasky</a>) recently tweeted:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A sad but inescapable conclusion from the impressive launch of the M1 is just how much Apple squandered the potential of the iPad. The iPad has had amazing performance for awhile, so why is the M1 a game changer? Because it’s finally in a machine we can actually <em>do things on</em>.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Francisco is right: Power and performance aren’t the bottleneck for iPad, and haven’t been for some time. So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor? Is it headed toward functional parity with the Mac or will it always be hamstrung by Apple’s strict App Store policies and seemingly inconsistent investment in iPadOS?</p>



<p>It’s clear that Apple <em>wants</em> the iPad Pro to be a device that a wide variety of professionals can use to get work done. And since so many people use web apps for their work, the introduction of “desktop” Safari for iPad was an important step toward that goal. The Magic Keyboard and trackpad was another step.</p>



<p>Here are ten more steps I believe Apple could and should take to help nudge the iPad into this exciting next era of computing.</p>



<ol><li>Give the iPad Pro another port. Two USB 4.0 ports would be lovely.</li><li>Adopt a landscape-first mindset. Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.</li><li>Introduce Gatekeeper and app notarization for iOS. The process of side-loading apps should <em>not</em> be as simple as downloading them from the App Store. Bury it in Settings, make it slightly convoluted, whatever: just have an officially-sanctioned way of doing it.</li><li>Ruthlessly purge the App Store Guidelines of anything that prevents the iPad from serving as a development machine. Every kind of development from web to games should be possible on an iPad. And speaking of games—emulators should be allowed, too.</li><li>Release a suite of professional first-party apps at premium prices. If someone can edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their M1 MacBook Air, they should be able to edit 4K videos in Final Cut on their iPad Pro. I refuse to believe that these pro apps can’t be re-imagined and optimized for a touch experience. If Apple leads the way in developing premium software for iPad, others will follow.</li><li>Make it possible to write, release, and install plug-ins (if appropriate) for the aforementioned first party apps.</li><li>Bring App Library to the iPad and allow widgets to be positioned anywhere on the Home Screen. This isn’t groundbreaking, it just annoys the heck out of me.</li><li>Release a new keyboard + trackpad case accessory that allows the iPad to be used in tablet mode without removing it from the case.</li><li>Introduce Time Machine backups for iPadOS.</li><li>5G, ofc.</li></ol>



<p>In the end, fostering a vibrant community of iPad app developers can only stand to benefit the Mac (and vice-versa).</p>



<p>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them. The new M1 Macs should give iPad fans reason to be excited; now that we’ve seen hints of what future Macs can be, it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</p>



<p>In other words: Your move, iPad.</p>

    <section>
      

      <p>
        Quick note: I don't really have a blog, but I wanted to publish this
        on my site, so this just has some quick styles applied.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
	<strong>Resolution</strong>: My Discord account has been unbanned. After posting this page on Hacker News, the head of Discord's anti-abuse team saw it and looked into the issue. It turns out that my use of a third-party Discord client called Ripcord was the reason for my ban. At the time of the ban, I had been using this client for years, but I wasn't actively using it. I was actually using the official client, hence the older title of this page, but the third-party client was open on my laptop in the background. I leave this page here to chronicle how unacceptable Discord's response to this was.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        It's true: Discord banned me for using their own client. On 1
        November, I was scrolling through my old DMs. It was kind of messy, so
        I started to close some of them (which really just <em>hides</em>
        them). After closing maybe around seven of them, Discord booted me
        back to the login screen. I thought that was weird, but I grabbed my
        phone to scan the QR code to log in, but it didn't work. Annoyed, I
        manually typed in my login details only to find that my account has
        been disabled.
      </p>

      <h2>1 November</h2>

      <p>
        On the same day, 1 November, I opened a ticket (9765093) stating that
        I wasn't sure why my account was disabled and that I would like to
        know. They had sent me an email telling me that my account had been
        disabled, but the email only listed a vague list of reasons that could
        have caused the ban, and I didn't feel that I had done any of them.
      </p>

      <h2>3 November <small>2 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 3 November, two days later, Discord got back to me and let me know
        that I had received an email stating why my account was disabled
        (false) and that they had reviewed my ban and would not be reinstating
        my account.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same day, I responded to their email, stating that their
        explanation wasn't good enough and that I hadn't done anything
        wrong. I demanded they give me an actual reason and reinstate my
        account.
      </p>

      <h2>6 November <small>5 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        Three days go by with no response from Discord. On 6 November, I send
        another response to their email, reiterating my desires and asking
        that I at least be able to transfer power of my larger servers if they
        insist on being corrupt.
      </p>

      <h2>12 November <small>11 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        Another six days without a peep from Discord. 12 November: I send yet
        another response, reiterating what I had said in previous emails and
        asking to be put in contact with a GDPR officer to get the data I
        want.
      </p>

      <h2>14 November <small>13 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        After two more days, Discord <em>still</em> has <strong>not</strong> responded outside of
        the initial email I received. On 14 November, I file a new ticket
        (9984772) and mention my previous ticket number and restate that I
        would like a reason why my account was banned and to have my account
        reinstated, considering I hadn't actually done anything besides <em>use
        their official client</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>17 November <small>16 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        After three days, on 17 November, the new ticket gets a
        response. Discord gives me the same list of reasons (a list of bullet
        points that count as "spam and/or platform abuse") and assure me that
        they understand "you may not have malicious intent, [but] we have to
        protect Discord as a whole, and this behavio[u]r can hurt Discord and
        its users." They also go on to mention that as a "one-time gesture",
        they "went ahead" (past tense) and lifted the ban on my account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hooray, I guess. I go to log in to Discord and it turns out that was a
        lie. My account is still disabled. I figure maybe it needs some time
        to propagate the change, but after hours and then days of trying, my
        account remains disabled. During these initial attempts on 17
        November, I sent a response to Discord, stating that I would like to
        know the real reason I was banned, since what I was doing while I was
        banned wasn't spam or platform abuse, it was closing old DMs manually
        with the official client, a supported use-case. I also made note that my
        account had not been unbanned.
      </p>

      <h2>18 November <small>17 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 18 November, my account is still banned despite Discord saying they
        would lift the ban, so I send a quick response asking when the ban
        will be lifted.
      </p>

      <h2>19 November <small>18 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 19 November, I ask again, noting that this is the third time I've
        replied to this ticket and still not received a response.
      </p>

      <h2>20 November <small>19 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 20 November, I open yet another new ticket (10088193), reference
        the old one, and ask why I haven't been unbanned, demanding that they
        honour their word and lift my ban.
      </p>

      <h2>25 November <small>24 days</small></h2>

      <p>
        On 25 November, <em>eight days</em> after I was told my account would be
        unbanned and <em>twenty-four days</em> after the ban in question, I still
        have not heard from Discord. I was (and am still) banned for doing
        nothing wrong. Discord did not deign to reply to my last ticket at
        all, but I'm filing another one today (25 Nov, 10166788). I will
        continue to update this log of communications as time goes on.
      </p>

<p>Google made almost all its money from ads. It was a booming business — until it wasn’t. Here’s how things looked right before the most spectacular crash the technology industry had ever seen.</p>
<div>
<h3>The crumbling of Google’s cornerstone</h3>
<p>Search was Google’s only unambiguous win, as well as its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/26/googlealphabet-reports-fourth-quarter-2016-earnings-q4.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/26/googlealphabet-reports-fourth-quarter-2016-earnings-q4.html">primary source of revenue</a>, so when Amazon&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-continues-grow-lead-google-starting-point-online-shoppers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-continues-grow-lead-google-starting-point-online-shoppers/">rapidly surpassed Google</a>&nbsp;as the top product search destination, Google’s foundations began to falter.&nbsp;As&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/google-isnt-safe-from-yahoos-fate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/google-isnt-safe-from-yahoos-fate/">many noted</a>&nbsp;at the time, the online advertising industry experienced a major shift from search to discovery in the mid-2010s.</p>
<p>While Google protected its monopoly on the dying search advertising market, Facebook — Google’s biggest competitor in the online advertising space — got on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Google-Facebook-Increase-Their-Grip-on-Digital-Ad-Market/1015417" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Google-Facebook-Increase-Their-Grip-on-Digital-Ad-Market/1015417">right side of the trend</a>&nbsp;and dominated online advertising with its in-feed native display advertising.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sfu.ca/olc/sites/default/files/1.1.jpeg" width="533" height="239"></p>
<p><em><span>The people who turned to Amazon over Google? <a href="https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-13-at-10.40.08-AM.png">The 18-29 led the way</a></span></em></p>
<p>In late 2015, Apple — Google’s main competitor in the mobile space — added a feature to their phones and tablets that allowed users to block ads.</p>
<p>Devices running iOS were responsible for an&nbsp;<a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/27/apples-ios-drives-75-of-googles-mobile-advertising-revenue" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/05/27/apples-ios-drives-75-of-googles-mobile-advertising-revenue">estimated 75%</a>&nbsp;of Google’s revenue from mobile search ads, so by making this move, Apple was simultaneously weighing in decisively on the great ad blocking debate of the 2010s and dealing a substantial blow to the&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/24/apple-lays-the-groundwork-to-kill-online-advertising/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/24/apple-lays-the-groundwork-to-kill-online-advertising/">future of online advertising</a>.</p>

<p><em><sub>The rising number of users blocking ads on mobile showed no signs of slowing down</sub></em></p>

<p>A year later, as the internet went mobile, so too did ad blocking. The number of people blocking ads on a mobile device grew&nbsp;<a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/">102% from 2015 to 2016</a>; by the end of 2016, an estimated 16% of smartphone users globally were&nbsp;<a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2016/mobile-adblocking-report/">blocking ads</a>&nbsp;when browsing the internet on a mobile device.

<p><strong>Internet users had spoken, and they hated ads.</strong></p>
<p>In early 2017, Google announced its plans to build an ad blocker into its popular Google Chrome browser. Google’s ad blocker would only block ads that were deemed unacceptable by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/16/procter-gamble-unilever-google-facebook-and-more-form-coalition-better-ads" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/09/16/procter-gamble-unilever-google-facebook-and-more-form-coalition-better-ads">Coalition For Better Ads</a>, effectively allowing the company to use its dominant web browser to strengthen its already dominant advertising business.</p>
<p>Even after making this desperate and&nbsp;<a href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/20/google-ad-blocker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://fortune.com/2017/04/20/google-ad-blocker/">legally questionable</a>&nbsp;move, it would quickly become clear to Google that even though ads were getting better, ad blocking numbers would&nbsp;<a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-blocking-increases-consumers-improving/305978/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-blocking-increases-consumers-improving/305978/">continue to rise</a>. Google had given even more people a small taste of what an ad-free internet experience could look like.&nbsp;<strong>The company discovered that it wasn’t just annoying ads that people didn’t like; it was ads in general.</strong></p>

In an attempt to combat the effect of ad blockers, YouTube launched an ad-free subscription model in late 2015, but the subscription numbers were&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498470/youtube-red-subscribers-video-content-music">underwhelming</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube’s already insurmountable problems multiplied in early 2017 as advertisers&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/google-scrambling-for-solutions-after-advertiser-departures-youtube">began to pull out amid ad placement controversies</a>, and huge revenue generators began to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.ibtimes.com/pewdiepie-starts-weekly-twitch-show-uploads-youtube-over-party-video-2523797">leave the site</a>. Even those who weren’t blocking ads had trained themselves to ignore them entirely. Researchers dubbed this phenomenon “<a href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.tobiipro.com/fields-of-use/marketing-consumer-research/advertising/">banner blindness</a>”.

<p>Research showed that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bannersnack.com/blog/build-trust-display-ads/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.bannersnack.com/blog/build-trust-display-ads/">54% of users</a>&nbsp;reported a lack of trust as their reason for not clicking banner ads and 33% found them completely&nbsp;<a href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://downloads.pagefair.com/reports/adblocking_goes_mainstream_2014_report.pdf">intolerable</a>. These figures painted a pretty grim picture for the sustainability of online advertising, but especially for Google’s position within the industry.</p>
<p><em>Google’s mighty engine had started to sputter.</em></p>
<p><strong>A chance to pivot, and how Google missed&nbsp;it</strong></p>
<p>If losing a major portion of their audience and annoying the rest wasn’t bad enough, Google also failed to get ahead of one of the biggest shifts in technology’s history. They recognized the importance of artificial intelligence but their approach missed the mark. Since Google’s search pillar had become unstable, a lot was riding on the company’s strategy for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><em>“We will move from mobile first to an AI first&nbsp;world.”</em></p>
<p>Google’s then-CEO Sundar Pichai&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://blog.google/topics/inside-google/this-years-founders-letter/">famously predicted</a>&nbsp;in 2016 that “<em>the next big step will be for the very concept of the ‘device’ to fade away”&nbsp;</em>and that<em>&nbsp;“over time, the computer itself — whatever its form factor — will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.”</em></p>
<p>Google’s ability to acknowledge the coming trend and still fail to land in front of it reminded many observers of its catastrophic failures in the booming industries of social media and instant messaging.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sfu.ca/olc/sites/default/files/1.6.jpeg" width="533" height="296"></p>
<p><em><sub>Sundar Pichai wondering how to monetize a virtual assistant</sub></em></p>
<p><strong>Google vs.&nbsp;Amazon</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2014, Amazon released a product called Amazon Echo, a small speaker that could sit in your home and answer questions, perform tasks, and buy things online for you. The Echo was a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-echo-success-could-spell-big-trouble-for-google-2017-1">smash success</a>. Google released its copycat product, Google Home, two years later, but it was already&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/22/home-battleground-amazon-google-voice-technology">too late to catch up</a>, and had no clear revenue strategy.</p>
<p>Alexa — the assistant that lived inside the Echo — on the other hand, was quickly integrated into several products and services, and its monetization model was clear, viable, and most importantly future-friendly. The Echo made it easy to order products through Amazon, and every time someone used an Echo to purchase something, Amazon made money.</p>
<p>Google extended the reach of their virtual assistant by building it into Android, but doing so still didn’t provide an answer for how the technology would generate enough revenue to sustain Google’s expanding repertoire of expensive innovations.</p>
<p>Google’s ads relied on screens, yet voice interaction subverted screens entirely. Google briefly tried playing audio ads with the Google Home, but consumers were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/17/google-home-ads-bad-precedent/">far from receptive</a>. Investors&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-responds-to-concerns-over-monetizing-voice-search-2017-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-responds-to-concerns-over-monetizing-voice-search-2017-1">started to voice their concerns in 2017</a>, but Sundar Pichai told them not to worry, leaving them to assume that Google would use their age-old strategy and analyze users’ voice searches so that users could be shown more suitable ads on devices with screens.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sfu.ca/olc/sites/default/files/1.7.jpeg" width="533" height="336"></p>
<p><em><sub>Alexa celebrating its victory over Google</sub></em></p>
<p>Headlines in early 2017&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/ces-alexa-in-everything/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/ces-alexa-in-everything/">proclaimed</a>&nbsp;that “Alexa Just Conquered CES.

Amazon&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-confronts-microsoft-google-ibm-in-cloud-computing-wars/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.investors.com/news/technology/amazon-confronts-microsoft-google-ibm-in-cloud-computing-wars/">had already beaten Google once before</a>, holding 54% of the cloud computing market (compared to Google’s 3%) in 2016, and they were just getting started. By early 2017, Amazon&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/31/competing-with-amazon-is-crushing-retailers.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/31/competing-with-amazon-is-crushing-retailers.html">had begun closing in</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2017/02/03/amazon-go-is-the-future-plus-4-reasons-why-amazon-might-just-win-retail" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2017/02/03/amazon-go-is-the-future-plus-4-reasons-why-amazon-might-just-win-retail">the entire</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-are-going-bankrupt-at-a-staggering-rate-2017-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-are-going-bankrupt-at-a-staggering-rate-2017-4">retail industry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ads weren’t&nbsp;forever</strong></p>
<p>At its peak, Google had a massive and loyal user-base across a staggering number of products, but advertising revenue was the glue that held everything together. As the numbers waned, Google’s core began to buckle under the weight of its vast empire.</p>
<p>Google was a driving force in the technology industry ever since its disruptive entry in 1998. But in a world where people despised ads, Google’s business model was not innovation-friendly, and they missed several opportunities to pivot, ultimately rendering their numerous grand and ambitious projects unsustainable. Innovation costs money, and Google’s main stream of revenue had started to dry up.</p>
<p>In a few short years, Google had gone from a fun, commonplace verb to a reminder of how quickly a giant can fall.</p>

<p>IPFS is here. IPFS is a de-centralized file and webhosting protocol founded on ideals of freedom and openness. The Library Genesis collection is live on IPFS as of today, accessible via <a href="http://libgen.rs/">libgen.rs</a> and <a href="https://libgen.fun/">libgen.fun</a>. IPFS is like BitTorrent but has a single global swarm, and it's accessible on the web. You can learn about the IPFS project from <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS.io</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>IPFS is the next technical revolution in peer-to-peer networking, allowing people like you to share books with readers who request them. IPFS is the next best weapon in the fight against domain take-downs and internet censorship.</p>
<p>We can now each become a founding shelf for a free, global library. Let's start.</p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>IPFS is simple. <em>Hosts</em> (you) <em>Pin</em> files (books) using <em>Content Identifiers</em> (CID Hashes) to share them on the IPFS network. CID Hashes can represent individual files or an entire folder. Pinning saves the files to your local computer so you can share them, and others can Pin them from you.</p>
<p>Each CID Hash for Library Genesis represents 1,000 books, or about 5 gigabytes of local file storage. 100 pins = 100,000 books! Who ever told you that you couldn't start your own library?</p>
<h2 id="copyright-warning">Copyright warning</h2>
<p>Before you begin, make sure you understand <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-to-do-if-your-named-bit-torrent-lawsuit.html">the legal implications of hosting and sharing copyrighted material.</a></p>
<h2 id="installing-ipfs">Installing IPFS</h2>
<p>Are you a power-user or run a server? Jump to the section on <a href="#docker-for-servers">getting started with Docker.</a></p>
<p>If you're not, just install the <a href="https://ipfs.io/#install">IPFS Desktop client</a>. Make sure to read the <a href="#system-requirements">desktop system requirements.</a></p>
<h2 id="desktop-client">Desktop client</h2>
<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements</h3>
<p>Note that IPFS Desktop client is an alpha-stage software still in development. The command line version of the software for servers/home servers is more mature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires internet serice provider with unlimited bandwidth. Do not install IPFS if you have a monthly bandwidth or data cap.</li>
<li>Recommended at least 16GB RAM and Intel i5 or equivalent processor</li>
<li>Recommended at least 100 mbps, gigabit connection preferred</li>
<li>Recommended <a href="#port-forwarding">port forwarding</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="get-started_1">Get started</h3>
<h4 id="pin-your-first-cid-hash">Pin your first CID Hash</h4>
<p>Click Files &gt; Import &gt; From IPFS</p>
<p>Then copy and paste in your first CID Hash containing 1,000 books (about 6GB). Once it's complete, jump to the <a href="#cid-hash-index">CID Hash index</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker.com/get-docker</a>)</li>
<li>Requires internet serice provider with unlimited bandwidth. Do not install IPFS if you have a monthly bandwidth or data cap.</li>
<li>Requires between 10GB or more of hard-drive space. For more information refer to the <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/I5UinPRnv2LNZlMQcNODieaoo7W9L1KDbJMX36OKvdE/">CID Hash index with file sizes.</a></li>

<li>Recommended at least 100 mbps, gigabit connection preferred</li>
<li>Recommended <a href="#port-forwarding">port forwarding</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="get-started_2">Get started</h3>
<h4 id="create-your-docker-container">Create your docker container</h4>
<p>You can more documentation for the Go-based IPFS Docker container at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ipfs/go-ipfs/">Docker Hub.</a>.</p>
<p>/export will store your downloaded files, while the books from pinned CID Hashes will be located in /ipfs/data/blocks.</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d \
--name go-ipfs \
-v $HOME/ipfs/export:/export \
-v $HOME/ipfs/data:/data/ipfs \
-p 4001:4001 \
-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
-p 127.0.0.1:5001:5001 \
ipfs/go-ipfs:latest 
</code></pre>

<pre><code>docker start go-ipfs
</code></pre>

<h4 id="pin-your-first-cid-hash_1">Pin your first CID Hash</h4>
<p>This 'docker exec' command runs your 'go-ipfs' container with container command 'ipfs pin add'. This CID Hash contains 1,000 books, to add it run:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs ipfs pin add bafykbzaceaeofefgje22l7rhgtcgs22m32f4ysw5nqa3ty5zawfovqam7pj2c --progress
</code></pre>

<p>Once it's complete, jump to the <a href="#cid-hash-index">CID Hash index</a>.</p>
<p>You can also access the WebUI and add or manage pins from there. Port 5001 is the API port of the IPFS docker container and contains the same UI as IPFS desktop. You can access the webui in your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui">http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui</a>.</p>
<h4 id="cid-hash-index">CID Hash index</h4>
<p>Once you've pinned your first 1,000 you can add the next 100,000 books of the Library Genesis Scitech collection here:</p>


<h4 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h4>
<p>The IPFS swarm peer port is 4001. Opening it up will help you connect, but it is optional if you can't do so. To learn how to port forward port 4001 search your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ac1750+port+forwarding"><em>router model + port forward.</em></a></p>
<h2 id="torrents">Torrents</h2>
<p>Many volunteers have helped seed the torrents with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ed9byj/library_genesis_project_update_25_million_books/">Library Genesis Seeding Project</a>.</p>
<p>If you already downloaded the torrents you can add torrent folders to IPFS using <code>ipfs add</code></p>
<p>Start go-ipfs normally with <code>docker start go-ipfs</code></p>
<p>Configure go-ipfs to allow you link folders to the Filestore:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs ipfs config --json Experimental.FilestoreEnabled true
</code></pre>

<p>Restart with <code>docker stop go-ipfs &amp;&amp; docker start go-ipfs</code></p>
<p>Add the folders from where you saved them, starting with folder 1000:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs ipfs add $home/books/1000/ -r -w --nocopy --hash=blake2b-256 &gt;&gt;  $home/books/ipfs-add.log
</code></pre>

<p>Watch the log and check out the network activity:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec go-ipfs tail -f $home/books/ipfs-add.log
docker exec go-ipfs ipfs stats bw --poll=true --interval=1s
</code></pre>

<p>Black. Magic. Fuckery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the words used by the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jx360c/for_context_m1_macbook_air/gcvn0oy/">holdagold on reddit</a> to describe their experience with the new Apple Silicon M1 Macbook Air. Rarely does a product leave people effusing to the extent Apple Silicon M1 has done this week. At best, you get the people who really care about a system’s internals very excited like we saw with Zen 3’s launch recently. For everyday users who just want to browse the web, stream some Netflix, maybe edit some documents, computers have been “perfectly fine” for the last decade. We’ve seen incremental year over year improvements with slightly more performance, slightly more battery life, marginally faster SSD, somewhat thinner design, etc. But something genuinely new, something revolutionary, something once in a generation has been missing. I believe the Apple M1 represents something we can truly call “revolutionary”.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, it’s essential to set the context that I’ve only used two Apple devices in my entire life - <em>a personal 2013 MacBook Air and a 2019 MacBook Pro that I got through work</em>. Everything else has been either a custom-built PC, Windows laptop, or an Android/Windows Mobile smartphone. Even for a “PC/Android Guy”, I have to admit what I saw this week is something special. I believe it’ll go down as a significant milestone in computing history on par with some industry-defining chips like Intel’s 8086, 386, 486, Pentium, Conroe or AMD’s K8, Zen, etc. I hope for the return of Moore’s law and awakening of the x86 manufacturers from their slumber as this will be the “<em>slowest</em>” CPU Apple will ever make. <em>As Henry Clay once said</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all human powers operating on the affairs of mankind, none is greater than that of competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog is then my observation of the excitement around this significant launch and captures some of the user and reviewer commentary.</p>

<p>Apple launched its own M1 SoC that integrates an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, Media encode and decode engines, RAM - all on a single-chip. By including the RAM on the SoC, Apple is marketing this as a Unified Memory Architecture (UMA), central to the performance improvements M1 brings.</p>

</figure>
<p>The first products and price points the M1 will be going into are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mac Mini - $699</li>
<li>MacBook Air 13" - $999</li>
<li>MacBook Pro 13" - $1299</li>
</ol>
<p>Apple promises its new chip is much more energy-efficient than its Intel counterparts, so the battery life promises have gone up across the board:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the MacBook Air - up to 18 hours of video on a single charge (<em>up from 12 hours on this year’s Intel-powered MacBook Air</em>) and offers up to 15 hours of wireless web browsing per charge (<em>up from 11 hours previously</em>)</li>
<li>On the MacBook Pro - up to 17 hours of wireless web browsing (<em>up from 10 hours with this year’s Intel-powered MacBook Pro</em>), and 20 hours of video playback (<em>up from 10 hours before</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>To showcase that energy efficiency, Apple is shipping the Macbook Air without any fan! It will be passively cooled like all iPhones and iPads.</p>


<p>Surprisingly no! Apple included Rosetta 2 ahead-of-time binary translation technology that translates code designed to run on Intel/x86 CPUs for the Apple Silicon CPUs. The performance is much better than expected and ranges between 70-80% of native code, which is surprising compared to Microsoft’s struggles in emulating x86 Windows apps on ARM CPUs. Apple’s answer might lie in something called TSO, aka. total store ordering as explained by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i0mido/apple_silicon_has_a_runtime_toggle_for_tso_to/">u/Veedrac and and u/ShaidarHaran2 on reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TSO, aka. total store ordering, is a type of memory ordering, and affects how cores see the operations performed in other cores. Total store ordering is a strong guarantee provided by x86, that very roughtly means that all stores from other processors are ordered the same way for every processor, and in a reasonably consistent order, with exceptions for local memory.</p>
<p>In contrast, Arm architectures favour weaker memory models, that allows a lot of reordering of loads and stores. This has the advantage that in general there is less overhead where these guarantees are not needed, but it means that when ordering is required for correctness, you need to explicitly run instructions to ensure it. Emulating x86 would require this on practically every store instruction, which would slow emulation down a lot. That’s what the hardware toggle is for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, Apple has, of course, been playing the very long game. TSO is quite a large benefit to emulating x86, hence why Rosetta 2 appears to put out a very decent 70% of native chip performance, that and install time translation for everything but JIT features. That’s on a chip not even meant to be a mac chip, so with further expanded caches, a wider, faster engine, perhaps applying the little cores to emulation which they’re not currently, and so on, x86_64 performance should be very very decent. I’m going to dare upset some folks and say perhaps even be faster in emulation than most contemporary x86 chips of the time, if you only lose 20% of native performance when it’s all said and done, it doesn’t take much working backwards to figure where they’d need to be, and Gurman said they were aiming for over 50% faster than Intel.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been numerous professional reviews and YouTube videos enumerating how Apple’s new products are better than their previous Intel counterparts. In the end, though, it comes down to how these products fit into the core workflows of the consumer who’s spending their money on them. There have been plenty of real-world experiences that I’ve seen in my filter bubble, mostly Reddit and Twitter. I will share some of these throughout this blog.</p>

<p>People keep saying this but it’s eerily fast and silent, like alien technology. I exported a 5 minute clip in unoptimized Premiere Pro and I swear it did it faster than my PC with a 2070 ever has. The MBP wasn’t even warm to the touch afterwards either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 2018 15” MacBook Pro which is used almost exclusively in clamshell mode these days and attached to an ultrawide monitor. I use it mainly for photoshop and Lightroom for my photography work, and it’s been painful to say the least. It’s quick for all of two minutes until the fan kicks in with the thermal throttling, at which point the machine chugs to a crawl. I’ve been wanting to get a desktop in replacement, eyeing the previous gen Mac Minis but unable to make the move due to the lack of discrete GPU and an inability to push my monitor’s resolution.</p>
<p>In comes the M1 Mac Mini - I ordered right away and received it Tuesday, and my god has it been a breath of fresh air. First impressions were insanely positive, even hooked to my 5120x1440 display it was lightning fast. But yesterday I put it through the paces with edits from a recent shoot, and it was beyond stellar. More photoshop tabs open than ever before, Lightroom CC and classic open together, nothing could slow it down.</p>
<p>To say I’m impressed with this first gen is a massive understatement, this is shaping up to be one of the most enjoyable devices I’ve ever owned. First computer that hasn’t had some feeling of compromise in a long time.</p>

<h3>How Rainbow Tables work</h3>
<p>I found the creator of Rainbow Table's paper, aimed at cryptanalysts,
was pretty inaccessible considering the simplicity and elegance of
Rainbow Tables, so this is an overview of it for a layman.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hash functions map plaintext to hashes so that you can't tell a
plaintext from its hash.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/1.png"></center>

<p>If you want to find a given plaintext for a certain hash there are two
simple methods:<br>
- Hash each plaintext one by one, until you find the hash.<br>
- Hash each plaintext one by one, but store each generated hash in a
sorted table so that you can easily look the hash up later without
generating the hashes again</p>

<p>Going one by one takes a very long time, and storing each hash takes an
amount of memory which simply doesn't exist (for all but the smallest of
plaintext sets). Rainbow tables are a compromise between pre-computation
and low memory usage.</p>

<p>The key to understanding rainbow tables is understanding the
(unhelpfully named) reduction function.<br>
A hash function maps plaintexts to hashes, the reduction function maps
hashes to plaintexts.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/2.png"></center>


<p>It's important to note that it does the reverse of a hash function
(mapping hashes to plaintexts), but it is /not/ an inverse hash
function. The whole purpose of hash functions is that inverse hash
functions can't be made. If you take the hash of a plaintext, and take
the reduction of the hash, it will not give you the original plaintext;
but some other plaintext.</p>

<p>If the set of plaintexts is [0123456789]{6} (we want a rainbow table of
all numeric passwords of length 6), and the hashing function is MD5(), a
hash of a plaintext might be MD5("493823") -&gt;
"222f00dc4b7f9131c89cff641d1a8c50".<br>
In this case the reduction function R() might be as simple as taking the
first six numbers from the hash; R("222f00dc4b7f9131c89cff641d1a8c50")
-&gt; "222004".<br>
We now have generated another plaintext from the hash of the previous
plaintext, this is the purpose of the reduction function.</p>


<p>Hashes are one-way functions, and so are reduction functions. The chains
which make up rainbow tables are chains of one way hash and reduction
functions starting at a certain plaintext, and ending at a certain hash.
A chain in a rainbow table starts with an arbitrary plaintext, hashes
it, reduces the hash to another plaintext, hashes the new plaintext, and
so on. The table only stores the starting plaintext, and the final hash
you choose to end with, and so a chain "containing" millions of hashes
can be represented with only a single starting plaintext, and a single
finishing hash.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/3.png"></center>


<p>After generating many chains the table might look something like:<br>
iaisudhiu -&gt; 4259cc34599c530b1e4a8f225d665802<br>
oxcvioix -&gt; c744b1716cbf8d4dd0ff4ce31a177151<br>
9da8dasf -&gt; 3cd696a8571a843cda453a229d741843<br>
[...]<br>
sodifo8sf -&gt; 7ad7d6fa6bb4fd28ab98b3dd33261e8f</p>

<hr>

<p>The chains are now ready to be used. We have a certain hash with an
unknown plaintext, and we want to check to see whether it is inside any
of the generated chains.</p>

<p>The algorithm is:<br>
</p><ul><li>Look for the hash in the list of final hashes, if it is there break
out of the loop.</li>
<li>If it isn't there reduce the hash into another plaintext, and hash the
new plaintext.</li>
<li>Goto the start.</li>
<li>If the hash matches one of the final hashes, the chain for which the
hash matches the final hash contains the original hash.</li></ul>
You can now get that chain's starting plaintext, and start hashing and
reducing it, until you come to the known hash along with its secret
plaintext.

<p>In this way you check through the hashes in the chains, which aren't
actually stored anywhere on disk, by iterating column by column through
the table of chains, backwards from the last column in the chain, to the
starting plaintext.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you wanted to check whether the hash exists in the last column of any 
of the chains you reduce and hash the given hash once, then check the 
generated hash against the chain end hashes.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a1.png"></center>

<p>You can check the second last column by reducing and hashing twice, 
then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a2.png"></center>

<p>And the third is checked by reducing and hashing three times, 
then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a3.png"></center>

<p>Supposing
a chain ending matches the generated hash the matching chain end might
contain the hash. The starting plaintext which was stored with the ending 
hash can be reduced and hashed until the correct plaintext is found within 
the chain.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a4.png"></center>

<hr>

<p>Collisions are the only problem with Rainbow Tables. Ironically
collisions are seen as a bad thing for hashing algorithms, but in the
case of Rainbow Tables a hashing algorithm which generates collisions
fairly regularly will be more secure.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/5.png"></center><br>
A given hash may be generated by multiple plaintexts (this is called a
collision), which is a big problem for chains because it causes chains
which start different to converge into one. Also you get loops, which
are caused when a hash is reduced to a plaintext that was hashed at a
previous point in the chain.<br>
<center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/6.png"></center>


<p>Because of these collision problems there is no guarantee that there
will be a hash of a plaintext that will reduce to some other given
plaintext.<br>
If you have a simple list of hashes and corresponding plaintexts for
every plaintext in a set you will know that if you have not found the
hash in the generated hashes the plaintext that generated the hash is
not in the set.<br>
If you have a table of chains where the reduction function reduces
hashes into the set of plaintexts you could have trillions of chains
generated but you still may not have generated every plaintext in the
set you want to check. You can only say how probable it is that a table
of chains contains a certain plaintext, and this can approach 1 but will
probably never reach 1.<br>
If you have a rainbow table with 10 chains of length 100 you have hashed
1000 plaintexts, but even if there are only 100 plaintexts in the set of
desired plaintexts the 1000 hashes you have in the chains may not
contain all the desired hashes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The way collisions are handled is what sets Rainbow Tables apart from
its predecessor which was developed in 1980.</p>

<p>The predecessor solved the problem of certain plaintexts never being
reduced to by using many small tables. Each small table uses a different
reduction function. This doesn't solve the problem completely, but it
does help.<br>
To solve chain merges and loops each chain ended at a "distinct point";
a hash which was unique in some way, eg hashes where the first 4
characters are 0. The chains keep on going until it reaches a distinct
point. If two chains end up at the same distinct point then there has
been a collision somewhere in the chain, and one of the chains is
discarded. If a chain is generated for an unusually long time without
reaching a distinct point a loop is suspected (where a chain of hashes
ends up reducing and hashing to a previous hash in the chain).
The problem with this is that if there is a collision there is
potentially a whole branch which has to be cut off and won't make it
into the chains, and a loop will cause all the hashes which came before
the loop in the chain to be discarded.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/7.png"></center><br>
Also all the time spend generating that chain will be wasted, and by
ending only at distinct points you have chains of variable length. This
means that you may have to keep checking for a hash within especially
long chains long after the other chains have ended.

<hr>

<p>Rainbow tables differ in that they don't use multiple tables with
different reduction functions, they only use one table. However in
Rainbow Tables a different reduction function is used for each column.
This way different tables with different reduction functions aren't
needed, because different reduction functions are used within the same
table. It is still unlikely that all plaintexts in the desired set will
be hashed, but the chances are higher for a given number of chains.
Chain merges are much, much rarer, because collisions have to occur on
the same column. For a chain of length l the chance of a collision
causing a merge is reduced to 1/l. Loops are also solved, because if a
hash in a chain is the same as a previous hash it won't reduce to the
same plaintext.</p>

<p>The reason they're called Rainbow Tables is because each column uses a
different reduction function. If each reduction function was a different
color, and you have starting plaintexts at the top and final hashes at
the bottom, it would look like a rainbow (a very vertically long and
thin one).<br>
By using Rainbow Tables the only problem that remains is that you can
never be certain that the chains contain all the desired hashes, to get
higher success rates from a given Rainbow Table you have to generate
more and more chains, and get diminishing returns.</p>


<hr>

<p>I hope by explaining the Rainbow Table I haven't made them any less 
wonderful ...</p>

<h4>An easy way to improve on the "rainbowcrack" Rainbow Tables implementation</h4>
<p>This section probably goes a bit beyond where a layman would be comfortable, 
but if you're interested in the practical applications of the above theory or have some 
interest in cryptography read on..</p>

<p>The rainbowcrack application is how most people come to learn 
about Rainbow Tables, because it is the application which puts the 
theory above into code. It has been very successful, with many websites 
dedicated to generating rainbowcrack hash tables and letting users search them.</p>

<p>However there is a pretty clear way this application could be improved, 
very easily, in the sense that the generated tables would take up a lot less
disk space, but be equally as effective for breaking hashes:</p>

<p>Remember above that when you want to generate a certain chain 
you start from an arbitrary hash. This just means it doesn't matter where 
you choose to start from. The rainbowcrack application starts from a randomly 
generated 64-bit number. This number is then used to generate a chain which 
ultimately ends with a 128-bit hash, which is reduced to another 64-bit number.</p>

<p>Why use a randomly generated number as the starting point? A …</p></div>

<a href="https://aakinshin.net/tags/performance-telemetry/">Performance Telemetry</a></span></p><p>Imagine that you are implementing performance telemetry in your application.
There is an operation that is executed millions of times, and you want to get its “average” duration.
It’s not a good idea to use the arithmetic mean because the obtained value can be easily spoiled by outliers.
It’s much better to use the median which is one of the most robust ways to describe the average.</p><p>The straightforward median estimation approach requires storing all the values.
In our case, it’s a bad idea to keep all the values because it will significantly increase the memory footprint.
Such telemetry is harmful because it may become a new bottleneck instead of monitoring the actual performance.</p><p>Another way to get the median value is to use a sequential quantile estimator
(also known as an online quantile estimator or a streaming quantile estimator).
This is an algorithm that allows calculating the median value (or any other quantile value)
using a fixed amount of memory.
Of course, it provides only an approximation of the real median value,
but it’s usually enough for typical telemetry use cases.</p><p>In this post, I will show one of the simplest sequential quantile estimators that is called the P² quantile estimator
(or the Piecewise-Parabolic quantile estimator).</p><h3 id="the-p-quantile-estimator">The P² quantile estimator</h3><p>This algorithm was initially suggested in <a href="#Jain1985">[Jain1985]</a>.
Below you can find a short overview of this approach,
notes about typos in the original paper,
numerical simulation,
and a C# implementation.</p><h4 id="the-main-idea">The main idea</h4><p>Let’s say we have a stream of observations <span>\(\{ x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, \ldots \}\)</span>
and we want to estimate p-quantile.
The suggested approach introduces five markers that correspond to the estimations of</p><ul><li><span>\(q_0\)</span>: The minimum</li><li><span>\(q_1\)</span>: The (p/2)-quantile</li><li><span>\(q_2\)</span>: The p-quantile</li><li><span>\(q_3\)</span>: The ((1+p)/2)-quantile</li><li><span>\(q_4\)</span>: The maximum</li></ul><p>The <span>\(q_i\)</span> values are known as the marker heights.</p><p>Also, we have to maintain the marker positions <span>\(\{ n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4 \}\)</span>.
These integer values describe actual marker indexes across obtained observations at the moment.</p><p>Next, we have to define the marker desired positions <span>\(\{ n'_0, n'_1, n'_2, n'_3, n'_4 \}\)</span>.
For the first <span>\(n\)</span> observations, these real values are defined as follows:</p><ul><li><span>\(n'_0 = 0\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_1 = (n - 1) p / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_2 = (n - 1) p\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_3 = (n - 1) (1 + p) / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_4 = (n - 1)\)</span></li></ul><p>In order to speed up the algorithm, we can precalculate increments of the desired positions which
should be added to the current values after each new observation:</p><ul><li><span>\(dn'_0 = 0\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_1 = p / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_2 = (n - 1) p\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_3 = (n - 1) (1 + p) / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_4 = (n - 1)\)</span></li></ul><p>Note that in the original paper, the authors use one-based indexing.
I decided to adapt it to the zero-based indexing which is more convenient from the implementation point of view.</p><h4 id="initialization">Initialization</h4><p>Once we collected the first five elements, we should perform initialization logic:</p><p><span>\[\left\{
\begin{array}{llll}
q_0 = x_{(0)}, &amp; n_0 = 0, &amp; n'_0 = 0,      &amp; dn'_0 = 0,\\
q_1 = x_{(1)}, &amp; n_1 = 1, &amp; n'_1 = 2p,     &amp; dn'_1 = p/2,\\
q_2 = x_{(2)}, &amp; n_2 = 2, &amp; n'_2 = 4p,     &amp; dn'_2 = p,\\
q_3 = x_{(3)}, &amp; n_3 = 3, &amp; n'_3 = 2 + 2p, &amp; dn'_3 = (1+p)/2,\\
q_4 = x_{(4)}, &amp; n_4 = 4, &amp; n'_4 = 4,      &amp; dn'_4 = 1.
\end{array}
\right.
\]</span></p><h4 id="marker-invalidation">Marker invalidation</h4><p>For each <span>\(x_j\)</span> for <span>\(j \geq 5\)</span>, we should invalidate our markers.</p><p>Firstly, we should adjust extreme marker heights
(if <span>\(x_j &lt; q_0\)</span>, we should update <span>\(q_0\)</span>; if <span>\(x_j &gt; q_4\)</span>, we should update <span>\(q_4\)</span>) and
find <span>\(k\)</span> such that <span>\(q_k \leq x_j &lt; q_{k+1}\)</span>
(or <span>\(q_k \leq x_j \leq q_{k+1}\)</span> for <span>\(k=3\)</span>):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Condition</th><th><span>\(q_i\)</span> update</th><th>k</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span>\(\phantom{q_0 \leq~} x_j &lt; q_0\)</span></td><td><span>\(q_0 = x_j\)</span></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><span>\(q_0 \leq x_j &lt; q_1\)</span></td><td></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><span>\(q_1 \leq x_j &lt; q_2\)</span></td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><span>\(q_2 \leq x_j &lt; q_3\)</span></td><td></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><span>\(q_3 \leq x_j &lt; q_4\)</span></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td><span>\(q_4 \leq x_j\)</span></td><td><span>\(q_4 = x_j\)</span></td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Secondly, we should update the marker positions and the marker desired positions:</p><p><span>\[\begin{array}{lcl}
n_i = n_i + 1 &amp; \textrm{for} &amp; i = k + 1, \ldots, 4; \\
n'_i = n'_i + dn'_i &amp; \textrm{for} &amp; i = 0, \ldots, 4. \\

I decided to visualize sequential values of the following quantiles estimator:</p><ul><li><strong>The P² quantile estimator</strong><br>A sequential estimator that is described above.</li><li><strong>The Type 7 quantile estimator</strong><br>It’s the most popular quantile estimator which is used by default in

    <p>Earlier this year, I was in the position to choose the framework for the startup at which I’m now the CTO. I
could’ve chosen anything. I went with Rails.  And you should, too. It still is the best framework for getting up
and running <em>and</em> for continued iteration and development.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Writing a web app requires many moving pieces.  If you use something like Spring, Node, Express, or any other basic
library, you have a <em>lot</em> of decisions to make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How are URLs routed to code?</li>
  <li>How are headers, params, and request bodies parsed?</li>
  <li>Where does the code live to manage this?</li>
  <li>How are responses created?</li>
  <li>How do we generate dynamic HTML?</li>
  <li>How do we mitigate against common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, web apps almost always have a database, which leads to more decisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will we access the database?</li>
  <li>How is the database schema managed?</li>
  <li>What conventions will we use for table and column names?</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, there are concerns around the development environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we write tests?</li>
  <li>How can we execute a test using a web browser?</li>
  <li>How do we manage the data needed for our tests?</li>
  <li>How do we manage data needed to run the app locally?</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there are concerns around deployment and production:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do I get JavaScript packaged for the browser?</li>
  <li>How do I manage CSS?</li>
  <li>How do I create cacheable bundles for CDNs?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-making-so-many-decisions">The Cost of Making So Many Decisions</h2>

<p>These decisions are only the beginning.  I’ve worked on web apps that used libraries only—no frameworks—and all of
these decisions plus more had to be made. Many had to be made before the team could start working.  But as time
went by and the team’s composition changed, managing these decisions was a constant tax.</p>

<p>…managing these decisions was a constant tax</p>

<p>Because <em>we</em> made these decisions and <em>we</em> configured our libraries to work in a particular way, it was not
uncommon for developers to want to know why we did it that way, and could we change it?  Many of these decisions
amount to conventions not enforceable with code, so a good chunk of our code reviews required making sure everyone
followed the conventions.</p>

<p>And then we would update our libraries to find out they were suddenly incompatible.  Because we’d hand-selected
libraries to solve each problem, we had no way to guarantee they all worked together other than making sure our app
still worked.  It was hard to see the value in the series of decisions that led to this architecture.</p>

<h2 id="stop-making-so-many-decisions">Stop Making So Many Decisions</h2>

<p>With Rails, you don’t have to make <em>any</em> of the decisions above. None.  Once you type <code>rails new</code> all of those
decisions are made.  True, there are more decisions you will have to make, but Rails will have eliminated a huge number of ultimately pointless decisions.</p>

<p>Rails will have eliminated a huge number of ultimately pointless decisions</p>

<p>It simply doesn’t matter how JavaScript is packaged, what your database naming conventions are, or how HTTP requests are routed to code. You need answers and conventions for all of that, yes, but the actual conventions don’t matter.</p>

<p>What you also need are the conventions to be enforced or managed in code, not documentation. That way, everyone is
incentivized to focus on the problems specific to their domain instead of the plumbing of their app.</p>



<p>This has been the value proposition for Rails since its inception over 15 year ago.  In that time, Rails and its
ecosystem have matured, improved, and continued moving forward.  The value Rails brings is still needed, and it is
<em>still</em> the best framework for most teams.</p>

<p>Engineers without Rails experience may continue to believe the fantasy that Rails does not scale or that it can’t
be used for “serious” problems.  Those of us <em>with</em> Rails experience know this isn’t true.  But what we also worry
about is that Rails apps can become unmaintainable.</p>

<h2 id="rails-helps-maintainability">Rails Helps Maintainability</h2>

<p>Hopefully, it’s obvious that no framework or set of libraries can ensure maintainability.  I would argue that Rails
gives you a better chance.  Rails—and its ecosystem—tend to evolve together, so you can rely on the stability of
your core tools over many years.</p>

<p>Rails basis in conventions also means that there are generally fewer parts of an app to get crufty as time goes by.
But, it’s still up to the team to establish conventions and ways of working to capitalize on that.  As it would be
on any team.</p>

<p>So what happens when the team stops making pointless decisions, worrying about library compatibility, and spending
code-review time on conventions?  They start thinking about the problems they need to solve. That’s why Rails is
the best web framework for most teams.</p>

<![CDATA[No surprises here – On the absence of information in today’s media]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-4a3121594376e73eb592"><div><h2>The absence of information in today’s press</h2><p>"<em>Nobody goes to a newspaper for news.</em>" —Martin Gurri</p><p>We're told we live in the information age. Statements like this often quote the mind-boggling amount of data produced on the internet using exotic-sounding words like zettabytes per day as proof. To function in this sea of data, we're supposed to find signals in the noise and read from credible sources of news and other information. With news media taking political stances, it's not that easy.</p><p>My assertion, paradoxically, is that polarization has greatly diminished the <em>quantity of information</em> being produced and consumed via today's press despite the sea of content they produce. The result is a loss of the press's effectiveness in their two functions within a healthy democracy, as a check on government and promoter of informed debate.</p><h2>Information</h2><p>It's important to define terms. What is information?</p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a> definition, the quantity of information in a message is related to the amount of <em>surprise</em> it contains. This idea of surprise is key so I'm going to spend some time on it.</p><p>Let's imagine you're receiving messages about some set of data and you're trying to determine its distribution. Each message contains one data point. Early on, as you receive messages, the information provided by each piece of data is high because you know very little about the data itself. With each new piece of information, you start to construct a representation of the overall data set like the one shown in the image below.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606176449103_6575"><div><p>After some number of points, you realize the data is a normal distribution or bell-curve and you can make some determination about its structure. In this case, the mean or average value as well as its width (or standard deviation). Let's say the average value is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This means that 68% of the values will be between -1 and 1, 95% will be between -2 and 2, and &gt;99% will be between -3 and 3.</p><p>Great! Let's say the next set of messages that you get are 0, 0.1, and 1. Those numbers are completely within the expected range we calculated earlier. There's nothing particularly surprising about them, and as a result, <strong>there is almost no information</strong> contained within them.</p><p>What if you get a message of 10? Now there's a problem. There's almost no chance that the distribution we described above should include a value of 10. Getting 10 is very surprising. So surprising that it may mean the model we had for this data is entirely wrong. That's a lot of information contained in one message of 10, way more than the other messages we got earlier.</p><p>Why does 10 have so much information? It's because it's surprising. It causes us to challenge the model we had built. It could be that the message was a mistake, a fluke. But it could also be that the conclusions we held were wrong. <strong>The more high-information messages like this we get, the more we should start to challenge the beliefs we previously held.</strong> Now let's get back to media.</p><h2>News media</h2><p>In today's polarized media, each side of the media discourse has established its perspective, and the content they publish conforms to this perspective. When you go to a news outlet with a particular leaning, you may not know exactly what stories they'll be writing about, but you do know what <em>kind</em> of stories will be covered and from what perspective. Your knowledge about that outlet's outlook was built up over time as you encountered what they publish.</p><p>When one outlet consistently publishes pieces that align with their perspective, the information content provided by each article starts to diminish. When the theme of each article aligns within the expected distribution, there's no surprise and thus no information.</p><p>It's important to take a moment to distinguish surprise from shock. As you may be familiar, it's common for media to publish stories that have a shock value as they compete with other organizations for your attention. What I'm discussing in this essay isn't the shock value or the particular event that the news media is writing about, it's the perspective of the news organization and the degree of surprise that they published it. For example, you might be shocked at the behavior of one political party's behavior, but are you surprised by it, and more importantly, are you surprised that a news organization that takes the opposite position is publishing a story about it? Shock and surprise can be related, but there's a distinction here between headlines that are attention-grabbing and whether the content fits the mold of the news organization's narrative.</p><h2>Implications</h2><p>The danger of this is two-fold. First, if you only read from one source or a set of sources with similar outlooks, the media source's perspective can start to become yours. You end up with a world-view that aligns with the publisher's view. Since that source never prints anything which disputes that view, your perspective on the world becomes insulated and unchallenged. It's like the example above where we thought we knew the distribution was a bell-curve until we got a few message outliers. Those outliers demanded we reconsider our earlier conclusions. Except this time, <strong>the outliers exist but we never receive them</strong>. We go about our days oblivious to information that would challenge our world-view because it doesn't get published anywhere we look.</p><p>"<em>A free press is one of the pillars of democracy</em>." - Nelson Mandela</p><p>The second danger involves the media's role as a check on government. The branches of government exist to prevent the abuse of power by one another. <strong>The press exists to prevent the abuse of information by the government.</strong> It should question and investigate claims by the government to inform voters and further civic discourse.</p><p>However, this function requires the press to be viewed as impartial, truth-seeking, and without advancing an opinion except where explicitly noted (i.e. the opinion section). If the average voter comes to distrust the press, this function is lost. Articles that would normally inform the voter, providing surprise and evidence that would counter a particular world-view, instead go unread or dismissed. Voters either write off the press entirely or read solely from outlets with views that align with their own further solidifying their own beliefs. In either case, we end up with tribes of perspectives unwilling to seek a compromise that can allow the country to proceed collectively.</p><p>I'm not claiming that all reporters are like this. There are excellent reporters that seek truth regardless of politics. Unfortunately, this independent perspective is increasingly difficult to find. Well-reasoned, objective reporting doesn't generate the same attention as partisan emotion.</p><p>Instead, our press needs to promote information and surprise without bias. By only publishing from one narrative, they insulate the public (and themselves!) from information that could lead to honest debate and discovery. Likewise, our opinions should be formed from a careful examination of arguments and evidence on each side of the issue, <strong>reading from only one perspective is akin to not reading at all.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

Some of the questions can be treated as action items, but many require deeper reflection (perfect for the quiet week at the end of the year). I hope that you find it useful as you close out 2020!</span></p>

<h5><strong>As a Company</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>What actions most moved the company forward and how can we double down on them? What should we have spent less time doing?&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Using the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/?sh=15a5959d3814"><span>Pareto Principle</span></a><span>, the return on certain actions will significantly outweigh others.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Did our actions reflect our values? Did we call out times that employees personified our values? Do we need to add or subtract values?</span></li>
<li><span>Which relationships are most important to our success (e.g. customers, investors, partners) and what can we be doing to provide them with more value?</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>As a Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Do we have the </span><a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html"><span>right people on the bus</span></a><span>?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the right people owning the right things or are there better ways that we can be distributing the work?</span><br><span></span><span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>I keep a Trello board to manage this; <a data-cke-saved-href="https://trello.com/b/v6lu8Xpc" href="https://trello.com/b/v6lu8Xpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steal my template here</a>.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/j9hSXZluRBG3S2HjajIu" alt="trello chart" width="683" height="158"></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How were my 1:1s? Did my reports walk away feeling that I had removed blockers, clarified vagueness, and given clear instructions?</span></li>
<li><span>Do my reports know their metrics for success?</span></li>
<li><span>How connected is the team overall?</span><strong></strong><span></span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Meetings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Is every meeting on my calendar still relevant and useful?</span></li>
<li><span>Have I invited the right people to each one?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the major meetings for the upcoming year already scheduled? Mine are:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Off-sites</span></li>
<li><span>Customers business reviews</span></li>
<li><span>Employee reviews</span></li>
<li><span>Team town halls</span></li>
<li><span>Quarterly kickoffs</span></li>
<li><span>Annual trainings</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Do I like the cadence and timing of my recurring meetings?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Can I schedule any back-to-back to minimize distractions?</span></li>
<li><span>Are meetings optimized to my energy peaks?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>I’m fresh and driven in the mornings and do my best work then. Mentally challenging meetings are best during this window.</span></li>
<li><span>My mind is more relaxed and able to freely brainstorm in the afternoons; I shift most meetings to this time.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Tools</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Are we using the right tools (software, banking, equipment, etc.) to accomplish our goals? Can we eliminate any?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/exgcpuvKRdmBDDBzKUvF" alt="saas-list" width="772" height="101">
<figcaption>
<p><span>This number balloons quickly, so I keep a spreadsheet of all our tools to track which are still in use and who has access.</span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><span>Do the right people have access to each tool? Has admin access been given to the logical person?</span></li>
<li><span>Do we have the right tier of service for our size?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there more effective tools available that could reduce or combine the efforts of others?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Finance</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Are our finances generally in order? This can include:</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Outstanding invoices</span></li>
<li><span>Unpaid bills</span></li>
<li><span>Sales commissions</span></li>
<li><span>Expense reconciliation</span></li>
<li><span>Credit card charges</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Are there areas that we could cut costs next year?</span></li>
<li><span>Is billing set to preferred person and method? (I like to see every charge come through and to optimize points based on spend.)</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Operations</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Where can we automate tasks?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the company files clean and organized? What about mine?</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>If a company file no longer seems relevant, I dump it into an archive folder rather than delete anything.</span></li>
<li><span>I run an inbox-zero on my file downloads and desktop, forcing myself to put any important files somewhere safe in case something happens to my computer.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Are our templated documents up to date?</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Check company address, point of contact, and legalese on contracts, mNDAs, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>How are our processes? Which ones are sloppy, overly prescriptive, or begging to be eliminated entirely?</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Performance</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>How did I perform against my job description?</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>I keep my job description as a living document to capture what I take on and hand off over time. When I doubt where my time is being spent, I discuss this document with my boss and adjust accordingly.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>How were my 1:1s with my boss? Did I come to the meeting with thoughtful questions and specific to-dos?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Did I listen to and incorporate feedback effectively?</span></li>
<li><span>Did I step up when I needed to? Did I delegate my areas of weakness?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Role</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>How do I want my job description to change in the next year based on what the company needs and on my own strengths and weaknesses?</span></li>
<li><span>Which relationships within the company are most important to my efficacy? Can I do anything to improve upon those relationships?</span></li>
<li><span>Which tasks I should be taking on or offloading?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Time</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Am I spending time on </span><a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/time-management-for-founders/"><span>the most valuable things</span></a><span> and letting the unimportant things fall through the cracks?</span></li>
<li><span>What have I been putting off?&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Can I eliminate it or delegate it?</span></li>
<li><span>Can I give it more clarity?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<ul>
<li><span>I tend to dread tasks that either feel pointless or excessively vague, so I ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>What can I stop doing altogether?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Personal</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Do I like my personal systems for keeping track of to-dos?</span></li>
<li><span>Do I know what I bring to the table when I join a meeting?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I maintaining a network of people I can turn to for advice?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I making time outside of work for activities that keep me healthy and happy?</span></li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As an indie hacker, we all struggle to validate our ideas, get our first users, and get some traffic. I played a lot with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xAvi_r">Reddit</a> for the last few months, and I can tell you: it’s a gold mine!</p><p>Reddit is super powerful:&nbsp;there are millions of users on the platform, each subreddit is very segmented by niche, and it’s free to use!</p><p>We sometimes see it as an intimidating platform, but it’s not that hard.</p><p>Here is how I&nbsp;use it:</p><h2 id="validate-your-idea">Validate your idea</h2><p>The first step of your indie hacker journey is to validate your idea. You don’t want to spend weeks building something nobody wants. But it can be hard to find your potential customers to validate your product idea.</p><p>With Reddit, you can do it easily. There are subreddits dedicated to Ideas’ feedback. You can post your idea there and you will get some responses within 24hrs. The feedback can be pretty generic as the people in these subs are mostly entrepreneurs and not your potential customer.</p><p>To validate my product idea I prefer to post directly on the sub I&nbsp;want to target. Let’s say you create a tool for developers then I’d post to /r/webdev. You don’t need to have a working MVP, just make some screenshot (or a video) and ask for feedback. Or, even better show them a landing page with a pre-order button or an email form and wait for their reactions.</p><p><em>(For the idea validation step, don’t be afraid to post on a big subreddit with hundreds of thousands of users, the more people see your idea the stronger your validation will be)</em></p><p>Within 24hrs you’ll know if that idea is worth pushing! If you get positive feedback - or even pre-orders - you can build your MVP. If you’re ignored or trashed, then find another way or get another idea!</p><h2 id="get-your-first-users">Get your first users</h2><p>Once your MVP is ready you need a bunch of beta testers to give you some feedback.
Reddit can also help you with that.</p><p>But this time I’d go with a small subreddit, and a super targeted one. Let’s say you created a no-code tool for startups, I’ll try to get my early adopters from /r/nocode (3.7k members) instead of posting on /r/startups (517k members) for instance. It’s a small subreddit, very niche. Then, once you have the first feedback you can iterate on it and post on some bigger subs.</p><p>The idea of “incremental launches” is to start small, build an audience, get some feedback, and grow step by step. Once the super-targeted subreddit loves your product you can start to post on big subreddit and get some traction.</p><p><em>PS: Small subreddit are super powerful if you choose them wisely. I got more than <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti/status/1325847913466048516">400 visits</a> in 48hrs from my last post on /r/nocode!</em></p><h2 id="get-some-traffic">Get some traffic</h2><p>Last step of the process: your MVP is ready, you need some traffic. And you want a lot of it!</p><p>The strategy here is to create some content around your product and share it with big subreddits. The secret is to provide as much value as you can. Share your secrets, how you grow your product, share your analytics, how much money you make, what did you learn during your journey, etc… It needs to be valuable and targeted to an audience.</p><p>Post your content to the biggest subreddits like /r/Entrepreneur, /r/Programming, or /r/Marketing and add a link to your product/blog at the end (Check the rules of the sub first, but most of them are ok with it)</p><p>If your content is well-targeted and brings some serious value you can get thousands of visitors in a day! And it’s totally repeatable. As long as you can provide value you’ll get some free traffic!</p><p>Do you want to launch on Reddit?

November 24, 2020 | https://systemoverlord.com/2016/08/24/posting-json-with-an-html-form.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://systemoverlord.com/2016/08/24/posting-json-with-an-html-form.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A coworker and I were looking at an application today that, like so many other
modern web applications, offers a RESTful API with JSON being used for
serialization of requests/responses.  She noted that the application didn’t
include any sort of CSRF token and didn’t seem to use any of the headers
(X-Requested-With, Referer, Origin, etc.) as a “poor man’s CSRF token”, but
since it was posting JSON, was it really vulnerable to CSRF?  <strong>Yes, yes,
definitely yes!</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, this is reminiscent of many of the confusions between server and
browser that are described in Michal Zalewski’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2QyTUaH">The Tangled
Web</a>.</p>

<p>The idea that the use of a particular encoding is a security boundary is, at
worst, a completely wrong notion of security, and at best, a stopgap until W3C,
browser vendors, or a clever attacker gets hold of your API.  Let’s examine JSON
encoding as a protection against CSRF and demonstrate a mini-PoC.</p>

<h3 id="the-application">The Application</h3>

<p>We have a basic application written in Go.  Authentication checking is elided
for post size, but this is <em>not</em> just an unauthenticated endpoint.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it basically serves a secret number that can be updated via
HTTP POST of a JSON object.  If we attempt a URL-encoded or multipart POST, the
JSON decoding fails miserably and the secret remains unchanged.  We must POST
JSON in order to get the secret value changed.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-options">Exploring Options</h3>

<p>So let’s explore our options here.  The site can locally use AJAX via the
XMLHTTPRequest API, but due to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">Same-Origin
Policy</a>,
an attacker’s site cannot use this.  For most CSRF, the way to get around this
is plain HTML forms, since form submission is not subject to the Same-Origin
Policy.  The W3C had a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-json-forms/">draft specification for JSON
forms</a>, but that has been abandoned
since late 2015, and isn’t supported in any browsers.  There are probably some
techniques that can make use of Flash or other browser plugins (aren’t there
always?) but it can even be done with basic forms, it just takes a little work.</p>

<h3 id="json-in-forms">JSON in Forms</h3>

<p>Normally, if we try to POST JSON as, say, a form value, it ends up being URL encoded,
not to mention including the field name.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;form</span> <span>method=</span><span>'POST'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;input</span> <span>name=</span><span>'json'</span> <span>value=</span><span>'{"foo": "bar"}'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>'submit'</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Results in a POST body of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>json=%7B%22foo%22%3A+%22bar%22%7D
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good luck decoding that as JSON!</p>

<p>Doing it as the form field name doesn’t get any better.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>%7B%22foo%22%3A+%22bar%22%7D=value
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It turns out you can set the enctype of your form to <code>text/plain</code> and avoid the
URL encoding on the form data.  At this point, you’ll get something like:</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we still have to contend with the form field name and the
separator (<code>=</code>).  This is a simple matter of splitting our payload across both
the field name and value, and sticking the equals sign in an unused field.  (Or
you can use it as part of your payload if you need one.)</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it All Together</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;body</span> <span>onload=</span><span>'document.forms[0].submit()'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;form</span> <span>method=</span><span>'POST'</span> <span>enctype=</span><span>'text/plain'</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>name=</span><span>'{"secret": 1337, "trash": "'</span> <span>value=</span><span>'"}'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This results in a request body of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>{"secret": 1337, "trash": "="}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This parses just fine and updates our secret!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-content"><p>“Don’t make me think” is a renowned mantra in the world of design, coined by Steve Krug. It has served as a guiding principle in the world of design and UX for twenty&nbsp;years. It teaches us how to create great experiences in a straightforward and accessible manner.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s article, we’d like to look into enterprise design and its peculiarities. It’s essential to underline that the very nature of enterprise UX slightly differs from consumer UX. As a result, some of Krug’s principles must be adjusted when designing enterprise software.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is by no means a refutation of the design principle. Please treat it as a mere asterisk with a fine print at the bottom.</p><h2><strong>Learning curves aren’t inherently bad</strong></h2><p>According to Krug, products that make people think also make people unhappy. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-learning-curve-design-problem-4d4dc2965098">Products with steep learning curves</a> very rarely succeed in the modern business ecosystem. Customers will pretty much always choose the path of least resistance. This isn’t necessarily true of enterprise products.</p><p>Enterprise users are power users — and it’s imperative that we take this into account when designing products for them. They interact with niche software on a daily basis and quite possibly for many years. They know their way around the logic of the products they use.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating an interface that demands some learning results in a steeper learning curve isn’t inherently wrong. It allows users to work more efficiently once they’ve invested a certain amount of time into training and learning.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606137908-figma-shortcuts-cheatsheet-1014x487.jpg?w=900&amp;auto=compress"><figcaption><a href="https://www.figmacrush.com/figma-shortcuts-cheatsheet/">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Take, for instance, products like Figma, Sketch, Adobe Pro, or any other professional software — most of them have a wide array of shortcuts. Features such as shortcuts may take a while to master, but they’ll ensure a significant boost in productivity once learned.&nbsp;</p><h2>Simplify cautiously&nbsp;</h2><p>We’re very well aware of the importance of keeping interfaces simple and obvious. However, it’s essential to keep in mind the complexity of the tasks typically performed in enterprise software. The pursuit for a clean UI could rid users of the vital context necessary to get work done.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, it can be argued that by making the interface too simple, we risk generating friction rather than eliminating it. Let’s envision an interface of a product that displays a wide array of charts and data, like a trading platform.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606138044-image2.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>A professional that regularly interacts with visual data needs immediate access to it at all times. Having to perform extra actions to access vital features is both frustrating and unproductive. And here lies one of the most significant differences between consumer UX and enterprise UX (eUX).&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer UX is really passionate about sleek UIs, while enterprise software must ensure that users are able to do their work comfortably. Therefore, simplified, minimalistic interfaces aren’t really what eUX designers are after.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wizards are cool, but…</h2><p><a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/ux-onboarding">Onboarding your users</a> is a vital step aimed at ensuring optimal user experience. However, while Wizards and guided tours are an excellent solution for casual users, it’s not necessarily the case for power users.&nbsp;</p><p>In both consumer and enterprise UX, designers must aim to develop products that require <a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/stickiness">as little hand-holding as possible</a>. However, simplistic product tours can be… well, simplistic. They often fail to uncover the entire functionality of a product, which is especially relevant for experienced users.&nbsp;</p><p>After running a series of tests, we found out that enterprise users tend to prefer to leave the app or platform for instructions. While this does seem somewhat disruptive to the experience of a product — it is understandable.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606210515-initiative-alladded1-1.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>Off-page instructions can provide more in-depth explanations rather than the ones that are placed on the screen. Compare, for instance, a tool-tip and an article dedicated to a particular function.&nbsp;</p><h2>Plan for non-linear flows&nbsp;</h2><p>When it comes to designing eUX UIs, designers face a truly arduous task of creating complex, non-linear flows. These flows often involve a variety of roles, profile types, responsibilities, kinds of security, and much more. Our goal is to create a consistent and recognizable experience throughout all of these variables.&nbsp;</p><p>The complicated part, however, is not to force users into flows and scenarios. Experts and professional users need that freedom to make decisions and use the platform as they see fit.</p><p>Think of a person that is deeply versed in Microsoft Excel. They’ve been using this software for nearly a decade, and they know it like the back of their hand. More importantly, they have their style of working and solving problems. Limiting such users via linear and rigid flows could defeat the purpose of boosting their productivity.&nbsp;</p><h2>Don’t fix it if it’s not broken</h2><p>Innovation is a crucial element of UX design. We strive to continuously seek new and creative solutions to old problems. Often, we can even choose to be bold and put forth experimental solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when it comes to eUX, we have to be somewhat more conservative and experiment with caution. Enterprise software isn’t quite receptive to design solutions that go against the grain.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the central purpose of such software is to deliver quality work in short amounts of time, “reinventing the wheel” isn’t always a great idea.&nbsp;</p><p>When designing for enterprise, keeping an eye on your competition is even more relevant than in consumer software.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s go back to Excel once more — imagine <a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/website-redesign">you’re trying to reinvent</a> a complex, spreadsheet-based product. You’re looking to change the ways it represents data, or certain actions are performed. While this does sound like a laudable task, the critical question is — why?&nbsp;</p><p>In eUX, the real value of a product is in its unique selling point that is translated via a design that looks familiar and intuitive.&nbsp;</p><p>That is not to say that the light of innovation never shines on enterprise products, but user expectations often trim the lengths we can go.&nbsp;</p><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>In order to reward you, our beloved reader, for making it till the end, we’ve designed a picture that summarizes the arguments in this article. We hope it will come in handy.</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606138895-enterprise-ux-summary.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>While the principles of “don’t make me think” will most likely outlive us, it’s crucial to outline the situations where they can be somewhat amended.&nbsp;</p><p>Enterprise user experience is a slightly more conservative field in terms of design, yet these limitations push us to become even more creative. By operating within these constraints, we have the power to make the future of work exciting and even more promising.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta: In this article, we explore the peculiarities of enterprise user experience design (eUX) through the lens of the “Don’t make me think” principle.&nbsp;</p></article></div>]]>

    <p>If you followed the recent Apple events, you probably saw a picture of the A14 and M1 dies… that got me thinking about what you would see if you could pass iOS under X-Rays…</p>
<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a>, I analyzed iOS based on the number of binaries and their programming languages. As I pointed out in this past post, the size of the binaries were not taken in account. In this new article, I look at iPhone OS 1.0 and iOS 14 from a size perspective using tree maps.</p>

<p>To produce the images in this article, I extracted the root filesystem (including the dyld shared cache) of each major iOS release:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>
<th>Device</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;14.0 (18A373)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;13.1 (17A844)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;12.0 (16A366)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;11.1 (15B93)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;10.1 (14B72)</td>
<td>iPhone 5s</td>

<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;9.0 (13A344)</td>

<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;7.0.1 (11A470a)</td>

<tr>
<td>iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.0 (7A341)</td>

<tr>

</table>
<p>I then created a tree map. You might be familiar with tree maps as they are often used to visualize a file hierarchy to give you a graphical overview of the structure. One key characteristic is that each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. The tree maps displayed in this article have been created using the awesome <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> and annotated with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at what you would see if you could scan iPhone OS 1.0 using X-Rays:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can already notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure is quite simple and has similarities to macOS</li>
<li>Frameworks are taking more than a third of the size</li>
<li>Fonts are taking more than 25% of the whole operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>We can go one level deeper and identify all the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the list of components, we can clearly determine all the main features of iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari + Web</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Wallpaper</li>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>Office support</li>
<li>Audio player</li>
<li>Video player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of components worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UIKit framework is taking more than 13 % of the total size</li>
<li>The wallpapers and ringtones count for 6 %</li>
<li>ICU (International Components for Unicode) takes more than 5 %</li>
<li>SpringBoard is roughly 2 %</li>
</ul>

<p>On popular demand, I added this section to provide more info about the fonts.
The huge <code>Fonts</code> block is composed of 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fonts representing 2/3 of the size</li>
<li>some caches (visible at the top of the area and representing a third of the size)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the font lovers, here is the complete list of fonts in iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<pre><code>AmericanTypewriter.ttf
AmericanTypewriterBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensed.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedLight.ttf
AmericanTypewriterLight.ttf
Arial.ttf

</code></pre>
<p>The cache contains info for all these fonts and includes the 2 extra files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HelveLTMM.ps</li>
<li>TimesLTMM.ps</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't give details about each iOS release but you can inspect the tree maps from iPhone OS 2.0 to iOS 13.1:</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the number of building blocks increased with each new iOS release and the components are becoming smaller.</p>

<p>We are now in 2020 and iOS 14 is available. Without a surprise, iOS 14 is way more complex than iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the diagram highlighting the functional blocks in iOS 14:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can note that the main structure is still fairly similar to the original iPhone OS 1.0 version: the fonts, frameworks, applications, library, /usr, … are still there.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 contains a lot of <code>Preinstalled Assets</code> and <code>Linguistic Data</code>. As far as I can tell, these components are used for on-device machine learning: language detector, voices, tokenizers, vocalizers, …</li>
<li>The dyld shared cache, a caching mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1, causes the Frameworks and Private Frameworks to be split in several areas. The dyld shared cache has been marked with the red box in the diagram.</li>
<li>Health is clearly an important feature of iOS 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many components in iOS 14 that it is way more complex to identify all of them. I gave it a try nonetheless:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it is now difficult to list all the features, there are some clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is packed with on-device machine learning technologies: Face Detection, Deep Convolutional Networks, Vision frameworks, Text Recognition, Neural Network, …</li>
<li>A lot of components are related to the camera and photos: Effects, Memories, video processing, photo library, …</li>
<li>Siri and voices are clearly visible.</li>
<li>As we already mentioned, Health is an important feature.</li>
<li>We can identify a couple of features added over the years: HomeKit, Watch, CarPlay, Spotlight, Emoji 🤟, News, iWork, Wallet, Shortcuts, ARKit, …</li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are now counting for less than 6 % of the size</li>
<li>Linguistic Data represent almost 8 % of the size</li>
<li>Although the ICU size was multiplied by more than 3 since iPhone OS 1.0, it now represents approximatively 0.5% of the total</li>
</ul>

<p>For readability the previous tree maps in this article were all displayed using the same size. If we present iPhone OS 1.0 next to iOS 14 with a proportional area, you would see that the whole iPhone OS 1.0 is basically taking the size of the iOS 14 wallpapers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/Compare-iOS1-iOS14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When iPhone OS 1.0 was released in 2007, it redefined the smartphone with a limited set of core features. Nowadays iOS 14 contains an incredible amount of components. By looking at them based on their size, we can determine the most important features. We thus distinctly see Apple's AI push into on-device machine learning with technologies like object detection in images and video, language analysis, sound classification and text recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Update 24.11.2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added fonts in the iPhone OS 1.0 tree map</li>
<li>Added fonts in the iOS 14 tree map</li>
<li>Add section with fonts info for iPhone OS 1.0</li>
</ul>

			<p>It has been a very long time since I’ve dealt with a major loom screw up.&nbsp; A really long time.&nbsp; Like I don’t remember the last time?&nbsp; And it isn’t because I’m so very good at this whole weaving thing, but it sort of is.&nbsp; I’ve been weaving since the mid 70’s.&nbsp; If there is a mistake, or screw up, I can assure you I made it or did it at some point in my career.&nbsp; One of the glorious things about being a weaver is the pure tenacity that controls what we do and how we approach a situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course by now, you are all familiar with my daughter and her major accomplishments as a weaver.&nbsp; She works for me now, and is responsible for converting all of my garment patterns into <a href="https://www.weaversew.com/shop/sewing-patterns.html">digital downloads</a>.&nbsp; She is also responsible for filming, producing and editing all of my videos for my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmz2mYvnteUP11-LvK8-eNg"><em>The Weaver Sews</em></a> and writing all of the Closed Captioning.&nbsp; (Yes, I caught that there were a couple of misspellings in previous episodes…)&nbsp; I couldn’t have moved into this next portion of my professional life without her, but that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>My daughter, Brianna, yes she has a real name, not the one she uses on Facebook, was asked back last winter if she would give a lecture to her old weaving guild in MA, near where she went to school.&nbsp; The lecture, on differential sett, was scheduled for April of this year.&nbsp; And of course we all know what happened in the northeast by April.&nbsp; The world was cancelled.</p>
<p>Since my daughter is a soon to be 28 year old millennial, she does her best work under deadline pressure.&nbsp; (Truth be told, so do I…)&nbsp; The guild called her last week and asked if she would be willing to give the lecture remotely.&nbsp; Hahahahah!&nbsp; Of course she said yes, which is what I would have done at that age.&nbsp; I use to have a sign on&nbsp; my studio door that said, “Say yes, then worry…”</p>
<p>So my daughter had to build an entire lecture that only existed as an outline, and weave all the samples in less than two weeks (the lecture is next week), plus edit and create new content for me, plus work in the evenings on her schooling, (yes, she is still in school to get her vet tech license).&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it….</p>
<p>One of the samples Brianna decided to weave, was exploring what happens when you use differential sett with really slippery rayon, warp and weft, and then slippery rayon warp and a dragging kind of weft like Shetland wool.&nbsp; The sample with the slippery rayon warp, though challenging, was completely successful.&nbsp; She then wound a warp with the Shetland wool, and the idea was she would tie into the rayon warp and repeat the experiment with a rayon weft and a wool weft, producing an additional two samples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one point, she said to me, as I was weaving on another of the looms in the studio, “This is ridiculous, tying in a new warp, I could have started fresh, sleying and rethreading in half the time…”&nbsp; and I couldn’t disagree with her.&nbsp; I’ve never found tying in a new warp to be a time saver.</p>
<p>I went off to do something else and came back and she had only tied in about 2/3rds of the warp, and she moved onto a different loom to do other samples of different weave structures.&nbsp; She told me that she was fed up and didn’t have the time to waste tying in 600 ends on a table loom.&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>I went off to other projects of my own, like writing the script for Friday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmz2mYvnteUP11-LvK8-eNg"><em>The Weaver Sews</em></a> Youtube installment.&nbsp; I came back and decided to finish tying in the rest of the warp, which would have been 200 ends.&nbsp; It wasn’t a big deal, and I can do stuff like that in my sleep.&nbsp; I was surprised when she directed me to make a square knot, I had always tied in new warps with an overhand knot, but I learned long ago that I didn’t argue with my late husband, and I don’t argue with his daughter.&nbsp; Even though I have almost a half century of experience…</p>
<p>I finished the task and then turned the job of beaming the 1&nbsp; 1/2 yard warp of sticky Shetland wool, onto the warp beam, over to my daughter.&nbsp; I think I went off to bed…</p>
<p>I came back the next day to find the warp abandoned.&nbsp; It was a complete disaster.&nbsp; I don’t think even at my worst I’ve ever had a mess like that.&nbsp; Partly I take some responsibility because my daughter has worked along side of me since she first learned to throw a shuttle.&nbsp; She never had the opportunity to fall flat on her face, like most weavers, including me, have had to do.&nbsp; I’ve always been there to guide her, when she chooses to listen to me.&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>Largely what happened, is that when she put tensioning bars in the back of the warp, and tried to beam the new sticky Shetland warp into the old slick rayon warp, the square knots didn’t hold, they slipped right out.&nbsp; And for some reason, the Shetland wool ends, that slipped out of the knots, ended up in the front of the beater, probably about 200 of the 600 ends.&nbsp; I think this wins an award for the most messed up warp I’ve ever seen.&nbsp; That’s partly why I did it…</p>

<p>I felt really sorry for my daughter, she was trying so hard to see this lecture into fruition…&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>I felt partly responsible because I knew that when you tie in a warp, you always use overhand knots.&nbsp; There are a lot of things I know, but I don’t know why I know them.&nbsp; And because my daughter requested square knots, I obliged.&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>I laid awake all Thursday night haunted by the mess on one of the looms in the garage right underneath of me.&nbsp; I kept thinking, if that were me, I wouldn’t have gone to bed without fixing it.&nbsp; But that’s me, even though I knew I had a video to shoot in the morning. I didn’t sleep the whole night.&nbsp; My daughter just moved to a different loom, and started on a different group of samples she had been planning.</p>
<p>In fact my daughter was so upset by what happened that she couldn’t even look at the loom. She couldn’t even walk over to that area of the studio.&nbsp; &nbsp;She is not use to having major loom screw ups…&nbsp; I’ve largely protected her from that…&nbsp; But that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p>We stopped everything to shoot the new video Friday morning, and I had some computer/business stuff to attend to, but Friday afternoon, I sat at the loom and thought, it has been a very long time since I’ve bailed a loom out of a major temper tantrum, and you know what?&nbsp; I really wanted to just dive in there and fix it.&nbsp; That’s why I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I had my new to me dog chew up a skein of yarn that was being wound into pirns for the weft yarn for a project I was working on.&nbsp; I got distracted by the doorbell, and when I returned I found&nbsp; the skein stretched around my loom, and all the way down the stairs, and the skein chewed beyond help.&nbsp; I can’t believe the number of weaver’s who offered to have me send them the skein and promised to untangle every last yard.&nbsp; There is something about fixing a monumental disaster that is really appealing for a weaver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster-169x300.jpg" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster-169x300.jpg 169w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster-84x150.jpg 84w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoroDisaster.jpg 345w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px"></a></p>
<p>I sort of think that it has to do with creating calm in chaos.&nbsp; There is so little in the world that we have any control over.&nbsp; But what happens at our looms, that thing, we have control over.&nbsp; And if what happens on our looms becomes total chaos, then patience, tenacity, and time will make it work.&nbsp; That’s why I did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I started Friday afternoon, after the shoot, and I began to reassess the 600 ends and how to best resolve the mess.&nbsp; Cutting the whole thing off and starting over was an option, but it would mean wasting a perfectly good 1 1/2 yard Shetland warp, that I paid good money for…</p>
<p>I decided that the best way out, was to carefully pull the warps that ended up in front of the reed, since they were only 1 1/2 yards, and resleying them where required (because this was a differential sett warp, there were dents where there were as many as five ends) and then carefully tying them back into the slippery rayon warps that went through the heddles, one by one.&nbsp; I probably spent 10 hours.&nbsp; This was really really challenging.</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3-150x113.jpg 150w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster3.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>I did it because there is something intensely satisfying about bringing order to chaos.&nbsp; There is something intense about saving a project.&nbsp; I had my doubts that this was even weaveable, 5 ends of Shetland in a 12 dent reed on a table loom didn’t see realistic, but that wasn’t for me to judge.&nbsp; I grabbed my 5X glasses, a magnifying OTT lite, and a sley hook and started in.&nbsp; 10 hours later I was triumphant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4-150x113.jpg 150w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster4.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>As I suspected, the warp was unweaveable at that dentage, Brianna had to pull some of the densest parts of the warp, but after much bitching and kvetching, she managed to get the sample she needed, but that’s not why I did it…</p>
<p><a href="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5-150x113.jpg 150w, https://weaversew.com/wordblog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Disaster5.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>For all of you out there who have ever had to deal with the warp from hell, remember that there is something healing in finally controlling that which would not be controlled, something triumphant about making something from total chaos.&nbsp; And that’s&nbsp; why I did it.&nbsp; It has been a long time since I’ve had to bail out a major loom screw up, and I loved every minute of it.&nbsp; It wasn’t my screw up, but I felt like a warrior on a mission and I was ultimately successful.&nbsp; Mission accomplished.&nbsp; It was sort of poignant that in the middle of the last inch and a half, that the election finals were called.&nbsp; No matter who you supported, the wait is over.&nbsp; And there is a sort of relief there, and now we as a nation can move forward to what I hope is a common goal.&nbsp; My ten hours of determination over a warp from hell was finally over.&nbsp; And I won.</p>
<p>Brianna did manage to beam and weave the new samples.&nbsp; She did as I suspected have to cull some of the warps in the densest part of the reed.&nbsp; But she learned that on her own.&nbsp; And she also learned that when tying in a new warp, you should use overhand knots.&nbsp; But kids learn by falling flat on their faces and picking themselves up and reevaluating the experience.&nbsp; I never had anyone to tell me otherwise, so I learned the hard way, by trial and error, but that weaver’s tenacity kept me moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To say that I’m so proud of the body of samples she …</p></div></div></div></div>
