<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">Attacks</a>: Some of the attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago while preparing demos for my GrayHat 2020 - Red Team Village presentation I ran across “Image Scaling Attacks” in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-quiring.pdf">Adversarial Preprocessing: Understanding and Preventing Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning</a> by Erwin Quiring, et al.</p>
<p>I thought that was so cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-image-scaling-attack">What is an image scaling attack?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to hide a smaller image inside a larger image (it should be about 5-10x the size). The attack is easy to explain actually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker crafts a malicious input image by hiding the desired target image inside a benign image</li>
<li>The image is loaded by the server</li>
<li>Pre-processing resizes the image</li>
<li>The server acts and makes decision based on a different image then intended</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to hide a husky image inside another image:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>Here are the two images I used - before and after the modification:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the second image does have some strange dots all around. But this is not noticable when viewed in smaller version.</p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/EQuiw/2019-scalingattack">Github</a>. I used Google Colab to run it, and there were some errors initialy but it worked - let me know if interested and I can clean up and share the Notebook also.</p>
<h2 id="rescaling-and-magic-happens">Rescaling and magic happens!</h2>
<p>Now, look what happens when the image is loaded and resized with <code>OpenCV</code> using default settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the original sized image, and on the left the same image downsized to 128x128 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>That’s amazing!</strong></p>
<p>The downsized image is an entirely different picture now! Of course I picked a husky, since I wanted to attack “Husky AI” and find another bypass.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This can have a set of implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training process:</strong> Images that poisen the training data (as pre-processing rescales images)</li>
<li><strong>Model queries:</strong> The model might predict on a different image than the one the user uploaded</li>
<li><strong>Non ML related attacks:</strong> This can also be an issue in other, non machine learning areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess security never gets boring, there is always something new to learn.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Turns out that Husky AI uses PIL and that was not vulnerable to this attack by default.</p>
<p>I got lucky, because initially Husky AI did use <code>OpenCV</code> and it’s default settings to resize images. But for some reason I changed that early on (not knowing it would also mitigate this attack).</p>
<p>If you use <code>OpenCV</code> the issue can be fixed by using the <code>interpolation</code> argument when calling the <code>resize</code> API to not have it use the default.</p>
<p>Hope that was useful and interesting.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Johann.</p>

<p><span>Written: 28 Oct 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><blockquote>
<p>Summary: NumFOCUS found I violated their Code of Conduct (CoC) at JupyterCon because my talk was not “kind”, because I said Joel Grus was “wrong” regarding his opinion that Jupyter Notebook is not a good software development environment. Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a>”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said that Joel Grus was “wrong”</li>
<li>I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</li>
<li>That I made “a negative reference” to his prior talk</li>
<li>I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">diversity issues in the tech industry</a>, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience with the NumFOCUS code of conduct raises a few key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</li>
<li>There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</li>
<li>I was held to a different, undocumented and uncommunicated standard</li>
<li>The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p>
<h3 id="my-talk-at-jupytercon">My talk at JupyterCon</h3>
<p>I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon</a>. My partner Rachel gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4">talk at JupyterCon</a> a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">exploratory programming environment</a>, using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a> which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p>
<p>Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time <em>not</em> to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png">
</figure>
<p>I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png">
</figure>
<p>Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130">his book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-of-conduct-violation-notice">The Code of Conduct violation notice</h3>
<p>A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p>
<p>The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a <a href="https://jupytercon.com/codeofconduct/">JupyterCon Code of Conduct</a>, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>. A link was also provided to <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">report violations</a>, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p>
<p>I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/response-and-enforcement-events-meetups">NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual</a>. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to convey it at the response team meeting”. I was also pleased to see that much of the manual and code of conduct followed the advice (and even used some wording from) the brilliant folks at the <a href="https://adainitiative.org/">Ada Initiative</a>, who are extremely thoughtful about how to develop and apply codes of conduct.</p>
<p>One challenge is that the JupyterCon CoC is based on Django’s, which has very general guidelines such as “Be welcoming” and “Be considerate”, which can be taken by different people in different ways. The NumFOCUS code is much clearer, with a specific list of “Unacceptable behaviors”, although that list includes “Other unethical or unprofessional conduct”, which is troublesome, since “unprofessional” can be catch-all gate-keeping mechanism for whatever those in the “profession” deem to be against their particular norms, and which those outside the in-group …</p></div></div></div>

<p>We’re very excited to release Pyston v2, a faster and highly compatible implementation of the Python programming language.  Version 2 is 20% faster than stock Python 3.8 on our macrobenchmarks.  More importantly, it is likely to be faster on your code.  Pyston v2 can reduce server costs, reduce user latencies, and improve developer productivity.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is easy to deploy, so if you’re looking for better Python performance, we encourage you to take five minutes and <a href="#availability">try Pyston</a>. Doing so is one of the easiest ways to speed up your project.</p>



<h2>Performance</h2>



<p>Pyston v2 provides a noticeable speedup on many workloads while having few drawbacks.  Our focus has been on web serving workloads, but Pyston v2 is also faster on other workloads and popular benchmarks.</p>



<p>Our team put together a new <a href="https://github.com/pyston/python-macrobenchmarks/">public Python macrobenchmark suite</a> that measures the performance of several commonly-used Python projects.  The benchmarks in this suite are larger than those found in other Python suites, making them more likely to be representative of real-world applications.  Even though this gives us a lower headline number than other projects, we believe it translates to better speedups for real use cases.  Pyston v2 still shows sped-up performance on microbenchmarks, being twice as fast as standard Python on tests like chaos.py and nbody.py.</p>



<p>Here are our performance results:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>CPython 3.8.5</td><td>Pyston 2.0</td><td>PyPy 7.3.2</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>85s</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging mean latency</td><td>5.1ms</td><td>4.1ms</td><td>2.5ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging p99 latency</td><td>6.3ms</td><td>5.2ms</td><td>5.8ms</td></tr><tr><td>flaskblogging memory usage</td><td>47MB</td><td>54MB</td><td>228MB</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms warmup time [1]</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>105s</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms mean latency</td><td>14.1ms</td><td>11.8ms</td><td>15.9ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms p99 latency</td><td>15.0ms</td><td>12.8ms</td><td>179ms</td></tr><tr><td>djangocms memory usage</td><td>84MB</td><td>91MB</td><td>279MB</td></tr><tr><td>Pylint speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.16x</td><td>0.50x</td></tr><tr><td>mypy speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.07x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyTorch speedup</td><td>1x</td><td>1.00x [2]</td><td>unsupported</td></tr><tr><td>PyPy benchmark suite [3]</td><td>1x</td><td>1.36x</td><td>2.48x</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Results were collected on an m5.large EC2 instance running Ubuntu 20.04</figcaption></figure>



<p>[1] Warmup time is defined as time until the benchmark reached 95% of peak performance; if it was not distinguishable from noise it is marked “n/a”.  Only post-warmup behavior is considered for latency measurement.<br>[2] mypy and PyTorch don’t support automatically building their C extensions from source, so these Pyston numbers use our unsafe compatibility mode<br>[3] The PyPy benchmark suite was modified to only run the benchmarks that are compatible with Python 3.8</p>



<h2>Results analysis</h2>



<p>In our targeted benchmarks (djangocms + flaskblogging), Pyston v2 provides an average 1.22x speedup for mean latency and an 1.18x improvement for p99 latency while using a just few more megabytes per process.  We have not yet invested time in optimizing the other benchmarks.</p>



<p>“p99 latency” is the upper 99th percentile of the response-time distribution, and is a common metric used in web serving contexts since it can provide insight into user experience that is lost by taking an average.  PyPy’s high p99 latency on djangocms comes from periodic latency spikes, presumably from garbage collection pauses.  CPython and Pyston both exhibit periodic spikes, presumably from their cycle collectors, but they are both less frequent and much smaller in magnitude.</p>



<p>The mypy and PyTorch benchmarks show a natural boundary of Pyston v2. These benchmarks both do the bulk of their work in C extensions which are unaffected by our Python speedups.  We natively support the C API and do not have an emulation layer, so we are still able to provide a small boost to mypy performance and do not degrade pytorch or numpy performance.  Your benefit will depend on your mix of Python and C extension work.</p>



<h2>Technical approach</h2>



<p>We’re planning on going into more detail in future blog posts, but some of the techniques we use in Pyston v2 include:</p>



<ul><li>A very-low-overhead JIT using <a href="https://luajit.org/dynasm.html">DynASM</a></li><li><a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue14757">Quickening</a></li><li>General CPython optimizations</li><li>Build process improvements</li></ul>



<h2>Compatibility</h2>



<p>Since Pyston is a fork of CPython, we believe it is one of the most compatible alternative Python implementations available today.  It supports all the same features and C API that CPython does.</p>



<p>While Pyston is identically functional in theory, in practice there are some temporary compatibility hurdles for any new Python implementation.  Please see <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">our wiki</a> for details.</p>



<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>



<p>Pyston v2.0 is <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/releases">immediately available</a> as a pre-built package.  Currently, we have packages for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 x86_64.  If you would like support for a different OS, let us know by filing an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>



<p>Trying out Pyston is as simple as installing our package, replacing <code>python3</code> with <code>pyston3</code>, and reinstalling your dependencies with <code>pip-pyston3 install</code> (though see our <a href="https://github.com/pyston/pyston/wiki">wiki</a> for a known issue about setuptools). If you already have an automated build set up, the change should be just a few lines.</p>



<p>Our plan is to open-source the code in the future, but since compiler projects are expensive and we no longer have benevolent corporate sponsorship, it is currently closed-source while we iron out our business model.</p>



<h2>Reaching us</h2>



<p>We are designing Pyston for developers and love to hear about your needs and experiences.  So, we’ve set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/S7gsqnb">Discord server</a> where you can chat with us.  If you’d like a commercially-supported version of Pyston, please <a href="mailto:business@pyston.org">send us an email</a>.</p>



<p>We’ve optimized Pyston for several use cases but are eager to hear about new ones so that we can make it even more beneficial.  If you run into any problems or instances where Pyston does not help as much as expected, please let us know!</p>



<h2>Background</h2>



<p>We designed Pyston v1 at Dropbox to speed up Python for its web serving workloads.  After the project ended, some of us from the team brainstormed how we would do it differently if we were to do it again.  In early 2020, enough pieces were in place for us to start a company and work on Pyston full-time.</p>



<p>Pyston v2 is inspired by but is technically unrelated to the original Pyston v1 effort.</p>



<h2>Moving forward</h2>

October 28, 2020 | https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">wrote an article about how the SPA pattern has failed to simplify web development</a>. The <em>SPA pattern</em> (Single-Page Apps), I tried to define, was about the React model, which also covers, to a large extent, the model of Vue, Angular, and other frontend frameworks.</p><p>Like any critique, it begs for a prescription and I didn’t give one, other than gesturing toward server-side frameworks like Rails and Django. But I think there are some trends starting to form. I had queued up some time to <em>really dive into the frameworks</em>, but things like <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/12/holly-park.html">walking in parks</a> have taken priority, so here’s just a grand tour.</p><h3 id="opinionated-full-stack-javascript-frameworks">Opinionated full-stack JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>Primarily I’m talking about <a href="https://remix.run/features">Remix</a>, <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a>, and <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a>, though I’m sure there are similar efforts in the non-React world that are relevant. <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> <em>almost</em> falls into this category, but as far as I can tell, it’s still unopinionated about the data layer and most sites that use Next.js are still going to use a separate API stack. But that’s subject to change, because all of these are moving fast.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Remix, Redwood, and Next are all backed by companies or foundations, and that Blitz is aiming early on to be a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/blitz-js">sponsor-funded project</a>. These projects, I think, are trying to sidestep the “tragedy of the commons” failures of earlier open source, wherein overworked and unpaid maintainers service a large userbase and eventually burn out and abandon the project.</p><p>To take Remix as an example, it re-ties data loading with routes, and then gives the pretty amazing promise of <em>no client side data fetching by default</em>. These frameworks are also <em>opinionated about status codes and caching strategies</em>. RedwoodJS automatically creates an <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/tutorial/side-quest-how-redwood-works-with-data">ORM-like interface using GraphQL and Prisma</a>.</p><p>As context, Remix is backed by the folks from <a href="https://reacttraining.com/">React Training</a>, who are also the folks from <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a>, which is as much React pedigree as you can get without joining the team at Facebook. Redwood is run by <a href="https://prestonwernerventures.com/">Preston-Werner Ventures</a>, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, a GitHub founder. Next.js is sponsored and heavily promoted by <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, née Zeit.</p><h3 id="turbolinks">Turbolinks</h3><p>It’s worthwhile to just mention <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>. I didn’t use it until this year, and apparently there were issues with it before, but the pitch for Turbolinks 5 is: <em>what is the bare minimum you need to do to get the SPA experience without any cooperation from your application?</em></p><p>So it’s a tiny JavaScript library that sits on top of an existing server-rendered application and replaces full pageloads with SPA-like partial pageloads. Instead of loading a page from scratch, pages are loaded with AJAX, page contents are replaced, and client-side navigation updates your URLs. Basically, it prevents the ‘blink’ of real page transitions and saves on all othe sorts of costs of fully loading a new page. Turbolinks was spawned from the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> project, and works great with Rails but doesn’t require it.</p><p>In terms of power-to-weight for user experience improvements, Turbolinks is a standout: it adds very little complexity and a tiny size impact for a big user experience improvement.</p><h3 id="server-side-state-frameworks">Server-side-state frameworks</h3><p>These are the spiciest new solution. The main contenders are <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Laravel Livewire</a> (in PHP), <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">Stimulus Reflex</a> (for Ruby on Rails), and <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> (on Phoenix, in Elixir).</p><p>The pitch here is: <em>what if you didn’t have to write any JavaScript?</em> It sort of hearkens back to the critique of JavaScript in <a href="https://vimeo.com/5047563">_why’s ART &amp;&amp; CODE talk</a>, that web development is the only kind where you normally have to write in three (or more) languages. These languages also most remnants of “client-side” logic, putting it all on the server side.</p><p>How do they do this? Well, a lot of WebSockets, in the case of Reflex and LiveView, as well as very tightly coupled server interactions. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5">LiveView demo</a>, which I highly recommend, these frameworks tend to operate sort of like reactive DOM libraries on the front end – in which the framework figures out minimal steps to transform from one state to another - except those steps are computed on the server side and then generically applied on the client side. They also do a lot more data storage &amp; state management on the server-side, because a lot of those interactions which wouldn’t be persisted to the server are now at least communicated to the server.</p><p>These frameworks are exciting, and also extremely contrarian, because they are the polar opposite of the “frontend plus agnostic API layer” pattern, and they also wholeheartedly embrace the thing everyone tries to avoid: mutable state on the server.</p><h3 id="modest-progressive-enhancement-javascript-frameworks">Modest progressive-enhancement JavaScript frameworks</h3><p>These are typically used “in addition” to the above, but they certainly deserve a shout-out because I think a wide swath of frontend-programming concerns actually only need a tiny hint of JavaScript. But the main caveat is that <em>they assume that you know JavaScript and the DOM</em>, which are not necessarily universal skills anymore. A lot of developers growing up on React have acquired a real blind spot for native browser APIs.</p><p>The main ones I’ve looked at are <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus</a> (out of the Ruby on Rails camp), <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/">Alpine</a>, and <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmlx</a>. They’re all tiny, and work great in <em>existing pages</em>. I think – and here come the flames – <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> also fit into this sphere of progressive enhancement! If you just use good web components - <a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aweb-components+org%3Agithub&amp;type=Repositories">only ones that GitHub writes is a good rule of thumb</a> - then they can fit the role of just improving an existing static UI. It’s where you start to use Web Components as an apples-to-apples replacement for full-fledged frontend frameworks is where things seem to get dicey.</p><p>These frameworks have the luxury of operating on a deeply improved web stack, one with fundamental components like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch()</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObserver</a>. These things were previously at the core of the utility of progressive enhancement frameworks, and now they can just be the utilities that those frameworks build on.</p><hr><p>I’m sure that there are additional patterns out there! But these currents all seem strong right now, and it’s fascinating to see some really divergent and adventurous – and common-sense – approaches start to crop up.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-4802" role="main"><div><div><div><p>The Dutch company <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pal-v.com/en/" target="_blank">PAL-V</a> today announced that its Liberty flying car <a href="https://www.pal-v.com/en/press/worlds-first-flying-car-hits-the-road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received permission</a> from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rdw.nl/over-rdw/information-in-english" target="_blank">Netherlands Vehicle Authority</a>&nbsp;to drive on public roads.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The PAL-V Liberty, the flying car’s full name, is a gyro-copter.&nbsp;The rotor can be folded so that the vehicle can also drive on the road like a regular car.&nbsp;</p><p>It needs a runway of between 180 – 330 meters for takeoff, but only 30 meters for landings.&nbsp;Both in the air and on the road, its maximum speed is 180 km/hour (112 mph). Converting from road to air mode (or vice versa) takes between five and ten minutes.</p><p>The Liberty runs on normal gasoline, and has a range of 1315 km (817 miles) on the road. In the air, it can fly 400 – 500 km (250 – 310 milles), and can remain airborne for 4.3 hours.</p><p>The PAL-V Liberty weighs 664 kg (1464 lbs) when empty. Its fuel tank holds 100 liters. The tank of a Honda Accord, just by way of comparison, holds about 53 liters.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Already 30 orders for this Dutch flying car</h2><p>According to the company, about thirty Dutch residents have already ordered and paid for the Liberty. The list price is just under €500,000 ($587,000).</p><p>At the moment, the granted permission is only for a single vehicle. That means PAL-V cannot yet put their car into full production.&nbsp;The Netherlands Vehicle Authority first needs to ensure that the company can produce every vehicle according to the same quality standards.</p><p>PAL-V has been working on the Liberty since 2007. The European Aviation Safety Agency is still examining the company’s request to have the vehicles certified to fly. The company expects this permission to arrive in 2022.</p><p>The US state of New Hampshire <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/auto/features/article/this-is-the-first-state-in-us-to-allow-flying-cars-on-public-roads/634621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it legal to drive flying cars on public roads</a> in August of this year.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>See a video of the PAL-V Liberty driving <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/yIjSaEeO2l0" target="_blank">here</a>, and flying (briefly) <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/fFW_0C7yFCI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty-1320x660.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Flying-Car-PAL-V-Liberty.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="537" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car-1320x693.jpg 1320w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-flying-car.jpg 1408w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1-360x189.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pal-v-liberty-fying-car-interior-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The other day I had a bit of a crisis, I was worried that I was starting to have trouble with my memory. Something had to be wrong! I started to notice (increasingly!) my inability to recall trivial things; for example, the action points from a Zoom call, or a quote from a book that I had read a couple of months ago. Surely this can’t be normal?</p><p>Before calling the doctor’s office I did what any decent hypochondriac would do, and started googling. After clicking through a few pages, I began to feel a bit better. It was normal. Short term (or working) memory <em>is</em> inefficient, and unless I revisit the thing I’m trying to remember a few times, I’m most likely going to forget it. And no, it’s not a side effect of turning thirty. Phew.</p><p>It’s a “feature, not a bug” of how our memory systems are designed. </p><p>Our memory is made up of not one, nor two, but three components: 1) a sensory register, 2) working memory, and 3) long-term memory.</p><p>When I look back at my childhood or I remember some basic words from French, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in long-term memory. But when I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my working memory.</p><p>With my health crisis averted, I got thinking about technology and its impact (positive and negative) on the way the brain, and memory, function. With all the knowledge I could ever need at my fingertips, alongside note taking apps and the smartphones that are now an extension of our physical being -- am I being lazy or efficient, or a mixture of the two? Much like our overactive fight-or-flight response, has evolution not had a chance to adapt or catch-up with the mind of today versus our ancestors’? </p><h3 id="four-chunks-of-information">Four chunks of information</h3><p>We ‘can’t remember’ things because there is a limit to what we can hold in our working memory. Researchers used to think that it could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it’s widely believed that the working memory only holds about four chunks of information.</p><p>If you’re anything like me you’ll have to repeat something to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetitions are needed so that natural dissipating processes don’t suck the memories away. How many times have you found yourself shutting your eyes to keep other things from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate?</p><p>I believe that we need to offload from our working memory as soon as possible.</p><p>With the goal historically being, before computers, to move it to long-term memory. If this didn’t happen -- you’d essentially be waving goodbye to that memory. </p><p>Moving a memory from ‘working’ to ‘long-term’ takes time and practice. </p><p>There’s a steep drop in what you remember, anyway. The ‘forgetting curve’, as it’s called, is steepest during the first twenty-four hours after you learn something. Exactly how much you forget, percentage-wise, varies, but unless you review the material, much of it slips down the drain. What you remember after day one has a good chance of still being retained after thirty. </p><h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</h3><p>To improve retention, spaced repetition is typically used. This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, ensuring to space the repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days.</p><p>The good news is, our long-term memory has room for billions of items. In fact there can be so many items they can bury each other. It can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. This allows the synoptic connections in the brain to form and strengthen into a lasting structure.</p><p>Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.</p><p>Having strong foundations in your long-term memory also makes the working memory more efficient, and able to connect dots from wider, more abstract, fields. It gives our thinking ‘richness’ and ‘associative access’. </p><p>Richness refers to the theory that a large number of things we have apparently forgotten all about are still there, somewhere, and add depth to our thinking. Associative access means that your thoughts can be accessed in a number of different ways by semantic or perceptual associations  — memories can be triggered by related words, by category names, by a smell, an old song or photograph, or even seemingly random neural firings that bring them up to consciousness.</p><h3 id="offloading-memory">Offloading memory</h3><p>But now, of course, we don’t bother to do all of the hard work of committing many things to our long-term memory. We have devices -- and the internet -- to remember stuff for us.</p><p>When I think back to when I started journaling on my iPad and laptop, as well as using apps like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> that are focused on ‘<a href="https://st.im/ive-become-obsessed-with-networked-thought/">networked thought</a>’, it is interesting<strong> </strong>to hypothesise how they have potentially impacted the fundamental chemistry or feedback loops in my brain. </p><p>For me, they have helped reduce my cognitive load by letting me off-load much of what goes on in my brain to an external entity. In this day and age, this recall memory has become less necessary. Recognition memory is more important (i.e. the ability to judge that a currently present object, person, place, or event, has previously been encountered or experienced).</p><p>Research has shown that the internet functions as a sort of externalised memory. “When people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764755">as one study puts it</a>. </p><p>If you know that you ‘know’ something, and you know how to retrieve it (thank you Google) that performs pretty much the same function as having a brain stuffed with lots of long-term memories. And the new ‘networked thought’ apps allow us to make interesting connections between these various bits of stored knowledge in much the same way that a well-stocked memory does.</p><h3 id="using-our-second-brain">Using our second brain </h3><p>So I wouldn’t say we are losing our ability to remember, as I posed at the start of this post. I think people (me included) just don’t do enough work to move stuff from our working memory into our long-term memory. </p><p>Our decreased reliance on recall memory and our &nbsp;ever-decreasing attention spans may not be the disaster that I first feared.</p><p>I think that the internet and apps focused on network thinking do assist us. They do act as a second brain. And I think that &nbsp;makes us more efficient.</p><hr><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sarandywestfall_photo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sarandy Westfall</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/memory?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><br>Thanks to <a href="https://jonathangifford.com/">Jonathan</a> for reading through early drafts of this post.<br>For discussion, check out this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24917721">Hacker News</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC) is a powerful class of methods to sample from probability distributions known only up to an (unknown) normalization constant. But before we dive into MCMC, let’s consider why you might want to do sampling in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer to that is: whenever you’re either interested in the samples themselves (for example, inferring unknown parameters in Bayesian inference) or you need them to approximate expected values of functions w.r.t. to a probability distribution (for example, calculating thermodynamic quantities from the distribution of microstates in statistical physics).
Sometimes, only the mode of a probability distribution is of primary interest. In this case, it’s obtained by numerical optimization so full sampling is not necessary.</p>
<p>It turns out that sampling from any but the most basic probability distributions is a difficult task.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling">Inverse transform sampling</a> is an elementary method to sample from probability distributions, but requires the cumulative distribution function, which in turn requires knowledge of the, generally unknown, normalization constant.
Now in principle, you could just obtain the normalization constant by numerical integration, but this quickly gets infeasible with an increasing number of dimensions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> does not require a normalized distribution, but efficiently implementing it requires a good deal of knowledge about the distribution of interest, and it suffers strongly from the curse of dimension, meaning that its efficiency decreases rapidly with an increasing number of variables.
That’s when you need a smart way to obtain representative samples from your distribution which doesn’t require knowledge of the normalization constant.</p>
<p>MCMC algorithms are a class of methods which do exactly that.
These methods date back to a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b3d/c9438227f747e770a6fb6d7d7c01d98725d6.pdf">seminal paper by Metropolis et al.</a>, who developed the first MCMC algorithm, correspondingly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm">Metropolis algorithm</a>, to calculate the equation of state of a two-dimensional system of hard spheres. In reality, they were looking for a general method to calculate expected values occurring in statistical physics.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I introduce the basics of MCMC sampling; in subsequent posts I’ll cover several important, increasingly complex and powerful MCMC algorithms, which all address different difficulties one frequently faces when using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Along the way, you will gain a solid understanding of these challenges and how to address them.
Also, this serves as a reference for MCMC methods in the context of the <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-20-monad-bayes-1.html">monad-bayes</a> series.
Furthermore, I hope the provided notebooks will not only spark your interest in exploring the behavior of MCMC algorithms for various parameters/probability distributions, but also serve as a basis for implementing and understanding useful extensions of the basic versions of the algorithms I present.</p>
<h2>Markov chains</h2>
<p>Now that we know why we want to sample, let’s get to the heart of MCMC: Markov chains.
What is a Markov chain? Without all the technical details, a Markov chain is a random sequence of states in some state space in which the probability of picking a certain state next depends only on the current state in the chain and not on the previous history: it is memory-less.
Under certain conditions, a Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution of states to which it converges after a certain number of states. From that number on, states in the Markov chain are distributed according to the invariant distribution.</p>
<p>In order to sample from a distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a MCMC algorithm constructs and simulates a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, meaning that, after an initial “burn-in” phase, the states of that Markov chain are distributed according to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
We thus just have to store the states to obtain samples from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For didactic purposes, let’s for now consider both a discrete state space and discrete “time”.
The key quantity characterizing a Markov chain is the transition operator <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which gives you the probability of being in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i+1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given that the chain is in state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> at time <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now just for fun (and for illustration), let’s quickly whip up a Markov chain which has a unique stationary distribution.
We’ll start with some imports and settings for the plots:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>%</span>matplotlib notebook
<span>%</span>matplotlib inline
<span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np
<span>import</span> matplotlib<span>.</span>pyplot <span>as</span> plt
plt<span>.</span>rcParams<span>[</span><span>'figure.figsize'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span>
np<span>.</span>random<span>.</span>seed<span>(</span><span>42</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Markov chain will hop around on a discrete state space which is made up from three weather states:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>state_space <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>"sunny"</span><span>,</span> <span>"cloudy"</span><span>,</span> <span>"rainy"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In a discrete state space, the transition operator is just a matrix.
Columns and rows correspond, in our case, to sunny, cloudy, and rainy weather.
We pick more or less sensible values for all transition probabilities:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>transition_matrix <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>0.6</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.4</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
                              <span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span> <span>0.3</span><span>,</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rows indicate the states the chain might currently be in and the columns the states the chains might transition to.
If we take one “time” step of the Markov chain as one hour, then, if it’s sunny, there’s a 60% chance it stays sunny in the next hour, a 30% chance that in the next hour we will have cloudy weather, and only a 10% chance of rain immediately after it had been sunny before.
This also means that each row has to sum up to one.</p>
<p>Let’s run our Markov chain for a while:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>n_steps <span>=</span> <span>20000</span>
states <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span>n_steps<span>)</span><span>:</span>

states <span>=</span> np<span>.</span>array<span>(</span>states<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can monitor the convergence of our Markov chain to its stationary distribution by calculating the empirical probability for each of the states as a function of chain length:</p>

<h2>The mother of all MCMC algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings</h2>
<p>So that’s lots of fun, but back to sampling an arbitrary probability distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It could either be discrete, in which case we would keep talking about a transition matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or be continuous, in which case <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> would be a transition <em>kernel</em>.
From now on, we’re considering continuous distributions, but all concepts presented here transfer to the discrete case.</p>
<p>If we could design the transition kernel in such a way that the next state is already drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, we would be done, as our Markov chain would… well… immediately sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Unfortunately, to do this, we need to be able to sample from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which we can’t.
Otherwise you wouldn’t be reading this, right?</p>
<p>A way around this is to split the transition kernel <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into two parts:
a proposal step and an acceptance/rejection step.
The proposal step features a proposal distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, from which we can sample possible next states of the chain.
In addition to being able to sample from it, we can choose this distribution arbitrarily. But, one should strive to design it such that samples from it are both as little correlated with the current state as possible and have a good chance of being accepted in the acceptance step.
Said acceptance/rejection step is the second part of the transition kernel and corrects for the error introduced by proposal states drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo mathvariant="normal">≠</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q \neq \pi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It involves calculating an acceptance probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and accepting the proposal <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with that probability as the next state in the chain.
Drawing the next state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is then done as follows:
first, a proposal state <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
It is then accepted as the next state with probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_\mathrm{acc}(x_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or rejected with probability <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">_</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1-p_\mathrm{acc}(x\_{i+1}|x_i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, in which case the current state is copied as the next state.</p>
<p>We thus have</p>

  <p>
    Recent work by Dabney et al. suggests that the brain represents reward predictions as probability distributions
    <d-footnote>
      Experiments were conducted on mice using single-unit recordings from the ventral tegmental area.
    </d-footnote><d-cite key="dabney2020distribtionmice"></d-cite>.
    This contrasts against the widely adopted approach in reinforcement learning (RL) of modelling single scalar
    quantities (expected values).
    In fact, by using distributions we are able to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.
    Uncertainty is especially important in domains where making a mistake can result in the inability to recover
    <d-footnote>
      Examples of such domains include autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and the financial markets.
    </d-footnote>. Research in risk-aware reinforcement learning has emerged to address such problems
    <d-cite key="morimura2010risksensitive,chow2018riskconstrainedrl"></d-cite>.
    However, another important application of uncertainty, which we focus on in this article, is efficient exploration
    of the state-action space.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this article is to clearly explain Q-Learning from the perspective of a Bayesian.
    As such, we use a small grid world and a simple extension of tabular Q-Learning to illustrate the fundamentals.
    Specifically, we show how to extend the deterministic Q-Learning algorithm to model
    the variance of Q-values with Bayes' rule. We focus on a sub-class of problems where it is reasonable to assume that Q-values
    are normally distributed
    and derive insights when this assumption holds true. Lastly, we demonstrate that applying Bayes' rule to update
    Q-values comes with a challenge: it is vulnerable to early exploitation of suboptimal policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is largely based on the seminal work from Dearden et al. <d-cite key="dearden1998bayesianqlearning"></d-cite>.
    Specifically, we expand on the assumption that Q-values are normally distributed and evaluate various Bayesian exploration
    policies. One key distinction is that we model $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, while the
    authors of the original Bayesian Q-Learning paper model a distribution over these parameters. This allows them to quantify
    uncertainty in their parameters as well as the expected return - we only focus on the latter.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty</h4></div>
  <div><p>
    Since Dearden et al. model a distribution over the parameters, they can sample from this distribution and the resulting
    dispersion in Q-values is known as <b>epistemic</b> uncertainty. Essentially, this uncertainty is representative of the
    "knowledge gap" that results from limited data (i.e. limited observations). If we close this gap, then we are left with
    irreducible uncertainty (i.e. inherent randomness in the environment), which is known as <b>aleatoric</b> uncertainty
    </p><d-cite key="kiureghian2007aleatoric"></d-cite><p>.

    </p><p>
    One can argue that the line between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is rather blurry. The information that
    you feed into your model will determine how much uncertainty can be reduced. The more information you incorporate about
    the underlying mechanics of how the environment operates (i.e. more features), the less aleatoric uncertainty there will be.

    </p><p>

    It is important to note that inductive bias also plays an important role in determining what is categorized as
    epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty for your model.
    </p><p>

    <b>Important Note about Our Simplified Approach:</b></p><p>

    Since we only use $$\sigma^2$$ to represent uncertainty, our approach does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

    Given enough interactions, the agent will close the knowledge gap and $$\sigma^2$$ will only represent aleatoric uncertainty. However, the agent still
    uses this uncertainty to explore.

    This is problematic because the whole point of exploration is to gain
    knowledge, which indicates that we should only explore using epistemic uncertainty.
    </p></div>


  

  <p>
    Since we are modelling $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, we begin by evaluating the conditions under which it is appropriate
    to assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  <a href="#section-1" id="section-1"></a>
  <h2>When Are Q-Values Normally Distributed?</h2>

  <p>
    The readers who are familiar with Q-Learning can skip over the collapsible box below.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Temporal Difference Learning</h4></div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Temporal Difference (TD) learning is the dominant paradigm used to learn value functions in reinforcement learning
      <d-cite key="sutton1988tempdiff"></d-cite>.
      Below we will quickly summarize a TD learning algorithm for Q-values,
      which is called Q-Learning. First, we will write Q-values as follows <d-cite key="Sutton2017ReinforcementIntroduction"></d-cite>:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \overbrace{Q_\pi(s,a)}^\text{current Q-value} =
      \overbrace{R_s^a}^\text{expected reward for (s,a)} +
      \overbrace{\gamma Q_\pi(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})}^\text{discounted Q-value at next timestep}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      We will precisely define Q-value as the expected value of the total return from taking action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ and following
      policy $$\pi$$ thereafter. The part about $$\pi$$ is important because the agent's view on how good an action is
      depends on the actions it will take in subsequent states. We will discuss this further when analyzing our agent in
      the game environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Q-Learning algorithm, we sample a reward $$r$$ from the environment, and estimate the Q-value for the current
      state-action pair $$q(s,a)$$ and the next state-action pair $$q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})$$
      <d-footnote>
        For Q-Learning, the next action $$a^{\prime}$$ is the action with the largest Q-value in that state:
        $$\max_{a^{\prime}} q(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})$$.
      </d-footnote>. We can represent the sample as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) = r + \gamma q{(s^\prime,a^\prime)}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The important thing to realize is that the left side of the equation is an estimate (current Q-value), and the right side
      of the equation is a combination of information gathered from the environment (the sampled reward) and another estimate
      (next Q-value). Since the right side of the equation contains more information about the true Q-value than the left side,
      we want to move the value of the left side closer to that of the right side. We accomplish this by minimizing the squared
      Temporal Difference error ($$\delta^2_{TD}$$), where $$\delta_{TD}$$ is defined as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \delta_{TD} = r + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime) - q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The way we do this in a tabular environment, where $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate, is with the following update rule:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) \leftarrow \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime)) + (1 - \alpha) q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      Updating in this manner is called bootstrapping because we are using one Q-value to update another Q-value.
    </p>
  </div>

  

  <p>
    We will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) as the foundation to understand when Q-values are normally
    distributed. Since Q-values are sample sums, then they should look more and more normally distributed as the sample size
    increases <d-cite key="lecam1986clt"></d-cite>.
    However, the first nuance that we will point out is that rewards must be sampled from distributions with finite variance.
    Thus, if rewards are sampled distributions such as Cauchy or Lévy, then we cannot assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Otherwise, Q-values are approximately normally distributed when the number of <b><i>effective timesteps</i></b>
    $$\widetilde{N}$$ is large
    <d-footnote>
      We can think of effective timesteps as the number of <b>full</b> samples.
    </d-footnote>.
    This metric is comprised of three factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      $$N$$ - <b>Number of timesteps</b>: As $$N$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\xi$$ - <b>Sparsity</b>: We define sparsity as the number of timesteps,
      on average, a reward of zero is deterministically received in between receiving non-zero rewards
      <d-footnote>
        In the Google Colab notebook, we ran simulations to show that $$\xi$$ reduces the effective number of timesteps by $$\frac{1}{\xi + 1}$$:
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/brandinho/bayesian-perspective-q-learning/blob/main/Sparsity.ipynb">
          Experiment in a <span>Notebook</span>
        </a>
      </d-footnote>.
      When sparsity is present, we lose samples (since they are always zero).
      <!-- As sparsity increases, we essentially lose samples since they are always zero. -->
      Therefore, as $$\xi$$ increases, $$\widetilde{N}$$ decreases.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\gamma$$ - <b>Discount Factor</b>:
      As $$\gamma$$ gets smaller, the agent places more weight on immediate rewards relative to distant ones, which means
      that we cannot treat distant rewards as full samples. Therefore, as $$\gamma$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <div><h4>Discount Factor and Mixture Distributions</h4></div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We will define the total return as the sum of discounted future
        rewards, where the discount factor $$\gamma$$ can take on any value between $$0$$ (myopic) and $$1$$ (far-sighted).
        It helps to think of the resulting distribution $$G_t$$ as a weighted mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <d-math block="">
        G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N}
      </d-math>

      <p>
        When we set $$\gamma \lt 1$$, the mixture weights for the underlying distributions change from equal weight
        to time-weighted, where immediate timesteps have a higher weight. When $$\gamma = 0$$, then this is
        equivalent to sampling from only one timestep and CLT would not hold. Use the slider
        to see the effect $$\gamma$$ has on the mixture weights, and ultimately the mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>
          

          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>
          

          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>

          
          
        </div>

        
      </div>

      <p><label for="barGammaMixture">$$\gamma$$ = <span></span></label></p>
    </div>
  </ul>

  We combine the factors above to formally define the number of effective timesteps:

  <d-math block="">
    \widetilde{N} = \frac{1}{\xi + 1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\gamma^{i}
  </d-math>

  <p>
    Below we visually demonstrate how each factor affects the normality of Q-values
    <d-footnote>
      We scale the Q-values by $$\widetilde{N}$$ because otherwise the distribution of Q-values
      moves farther and farther to the right as the number of effective timesteps increases, which distorts the visual.
    </d-footnote>:

                <p>Take <strong>Uncle Bob's</strong> Clean Architecture and map its correspondences with <strong>Gary Bernhardt's</strong> thin imperative shell around a functional core, and you get an understanding of how to cheaply maintain and scale software!</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a> did. It's not every day that I find such clear insight.</p>
<p>I am honored to have found his <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#clean-architecture-python">presentation</a> and <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2014-07-pyohio/clean-architecture/">slides</a> explaining  <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture</a> and Gary Bernhardt's PyCon talks of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_422___units-need-testing-too">2011</a>, <a href="https://pycon-2012-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fast_tests_slow_tests.html">2012</a>, and <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries">2013</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Rhodes offers such a distilled view, that he can show you these crucial concepts in 3 slides of code. I will go ahead and summarize what he said and add a tiny bit of my insight.</p>
<p>Copyright of all Python code on this page belongs to <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Mr. Brandon Rhodes</a>, and copyright of the diagram belongs to <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</a>. I use these under (hopefully) fair use (nonprofit and educational).</p>


<p>First of all, we need to be on the same page, in order to be able to understand each other. Here are the words I'll use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: I use "function" or "pure function" to refer to a Python "function" that only uses its parameters for input, returns a result as output, and does not cause any other side-effects (such as I/O). <ul>
<li>A pure function returns the same output given the same inputs.</li>
<li>A pure function may be called any number of times without changing the system state - it should have no influence on DB, UI, other functions or classes.</li>
<li>This is very similar to a mathematical function: takes you from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> and nothing else happens.</li>
<li>Sadly we can't have only pure functions; software has a <strong>purpose</strong> of causing side-effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure, Routine, or Subroutine: A piece of code that executes, that may or may not have side effects. This is a "function" in Python, but might not be a "pure function".</li>
<li>Tests: automated unit tests. By "unit" I mean not necessarily just a class, but a behavior. If you want, see more details in <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we have a piece of code that prepares a URL, then gets some data over the network (I/O), then validates the result (a word definition) and returns it.</p>
<p>This is a bit much: a procedure should ideally do one thing only. While this small-ish procedure is quite readable still, it is a metaphor for a more developed system - where it could be arbitrarily long.</p>
<p>The current knee-jerk reaction is to <em>hide</em> the I/O operations somewhere far away. Here is the same code after extracting the I/O lines:</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 2</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>

    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>

<span>def</span> <span>call_json_api</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>):</span>
    <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>     <span># I/O</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>           <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>data</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Listing #2, the I/O is extracted from the top-level procedure. </p>
<p>The problem is, the code is still <strong>coupled</strong> - <code>call_json_api</code> is called whenever you want to test anything - even the building of the URL or the parsing of the result.</p>
<p><strong>Coupling kills software.</strong></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to spot coupling is this: Can you test a piece of code without having to mock or dependency inject like Frankenstein?</p>
<p>Here, we can't test <code>find_definition</code> without somehow replacing <code>call_json_api</code> from inside it, in order to avoid making HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's find out what a better solution looks like.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>find_definition</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>           <span># Listing 3</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>)</span>
    <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>()</span>  <span># I/O</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span>

<span>def</span> <span>build_url</span><span>(</span><span>word</span><span>):</span>
    <span>q</span> <span>=</span> <span>'define '</span> <span>+</span> <span>word</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>urlencode</span><span>({</span><span>'q'</span><span>:</span> <span>q</span><span>,</span> <span>'format'</span><span>:</span> <span>'json'</span><span>})</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>url</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pluck_definition</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>):</span>
    <span>definition</span> <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>[</span><span>u</span><span>'Definition'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>definition</span> <span>==</span> <span>u</span><span>''</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>'that is not a word'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>definition</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the procedure at the top (aka. the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> of the program) is handling the I/O, and everything else is moved to <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> (<code>build_url</code>, <code>pluck_definition</code>). The <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> are easily testable by just calling them on made-up data structures; no Frankenstein needed.</p>
<p>This separation into an <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and <span><strong>functional core</strong></span> is an encouraged idea by Functional Programming.</p>
<p>Ideally, though, in a real system, you wouldn't test elements as small as these routines, but integrate more of the system. See <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/tdd-revisited-pytest-updated-2020-09-03.html#update-2020-09-03-keep-coupling-low">the coupling chapter of my previous post</a> to understand the trade-offs.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture chart</a> (Copyright Robert C. Martin aka. Uncle Bob) :
<img alt="The Clean Architecture" src="https://danuker.go.ro/images/CleanArchitecture.jpg"></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Use Cases</strong></span> and <span><strong>Entities</strong></span> (red and yellow circles of the chart) map to the <span><strong>pure functions</strong></span> we saw earlier - <code>build_url</code> and <code>pluck_definition</code> from Listing 3, and the <span><strong>plain objects</strong></span> they receive as parameters and send as outputs. <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>Uncle Bob's <span><strong>Interface Adapters</strong></span> (green circle) map to the top-level <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span>  from earlier - <code>find_definition</code> from Listing 3, handling only I/O to the outside (Web, DB, UI, other frameworks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jj7ave/the_grand_unified_theory_of_software_architecture/gabst6z/?context=3">Update 2020-10-28</a>: A "Model" object in today's MVC frameworks is a poisoned apple: it is not a <a href="https://khanlou.com/2014/12/pure-objects/">"pure" object</a> or <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Humble%20Object.html">"humble" object</a>, but one that can produce side effects like saving or loading from the database. Their "save" and "read" methods litter your code with untestable side-effects all over. Avoid them, or confine them to the periphery of your system and reduce their influence accordingly (they are actually a hidden <span><strong>Interface Adapter</strong></span>) due to interacting with the DB.</p>
<p>Notice the arrows on the left side of the circles, pointing inwards to more and more abstract parts. These are procedure or function calls. Our code is called by the outside. <strong>This has some exceptions. Whatever you do, the database won't call your app. But the web can, a user can through a UI, the OS can through STDIN, and a timer can, at regular intervals (such as in a game).</strong> <em>(updated 2020-10-28)</em></p>
<p>The top-level procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>gets the input, </li>
<li>adapts it to simple objects acceptable to the system,</li>
<li>pushes it through the functional core,</li>
<li>gets the returned value from the functional core,</li>
<li>adapts it for the output device,</li>
<li>and pushes it out to the output device.</li>
</ol>
<p>This lets us easily test the functional core. Ideally, most of a production system should be pure-functional.</p>

<p>If you reduce the <span><strong>imperative shell</strong></span> and move code into the <span><strong>functional core</strong></span>, each test can verify almost the entire (now-functional) stack, but stopping short of actually performing external actions.</p>
<p>You can then test the imperative shell using <strong>fewer integration tests</strong>: you only need to check that it is <strong>correctly connected</strong> to the functional core.</p>
<p>Having two users for the system - the real user and the unit tests - and listening to both, lets you guide your architecture so as to <strong>minimize coupling</strong> and build a more <strong>flexible system</strong>.</p>
<p>Having a flexible system lets you implement new features and change existing ones <strong>quickly and cheaply</strong>, in order to <strong>stay competitive as a business</strong>.</p>
<p>Comments are much appreciated. I am yet to apply these insights, and I may be missing something!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-10-28:</strong> I have tried out this methodology in some small TDD Katas, and together with TDD, it works great. But I am not employed right now, so I can't say I've <em>really</em> tried it.</p>

  <p><span>08 Apr 2020</span></p><p>When you run the Ubuntu installer, there’s an option to dual-boot Ubuntu with an
existing Windows installation. There’s also an option to encrypt your Ubuntu
installation, but <em>only if you erase everything and install ubuntu</em>. There’s no
automatic way to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 with encryption. And while
there are plenty of tutorials for dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows, many of them
are outdated – often referencing an MBR partition table – and almost none of
them seem to address encrypting your Ubuntu partition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dual-booting with encrypted storage should not be this hard in 2020.</p>

  <p>–Me, while figuring out how to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reality, once you figure it out, it’s not that hard. The tricky thing is that
this isn’t well-documented <strong>anywhere</strong>! So I’m hoping to fix that with this
tutorial blog post. Honestly, if you know enough about Ubuntu to set up a
dual-boot with Windows, it’s only a little bit harder to do it with encryption.
I prepared this tutorial on a Dell Latitude e7450, and I fine-tuned it when I
tested it on my Dell Precision 5510. So it should work with almost no
modification on most Dell systems, and with only minor modifications
(particularly around BIOS setup) on most other types of computers.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>To write this guide, I compiled information from several sources. Here are some
of the most useful references I found:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon/db2c9e5f6cc73bb37812a19a40e137bc">XPS 15 9560 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/luispabon">luispabon</a>. I followed these notes pretty
closely, but modified some partition sizes and names based on other guides.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon/221bdb597cf32b46c50ffab96dbec08a">XPS 15 9570 Dual-Boot with Encryption Notes</a>,
by <a href="https://gist.github.com/mdziekon">mdziekon</a>, upon which the above is based.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Full_Disk_Encryption_Howto_2019">Full Disk Encryption HowTo 2019</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is a great resource, but deals with
encryption without dual-booting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManualFullSystemEncryption">Manual Full System Encryption</a>,
from the Ubuntu Community Wiki. This is longer, and isn’t focused on
dual-booting, but provides great details on the way certain things work.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that this method doesn’t encrypt <code>/boot</code>. While there are
valid reasons for encrypting /boot, the graphical installer does not encrypt it
when you do a graphical install with LUKS. As such, I’m matching that precedent,
and keeping the simplicity of an unencrypted /boot partition. Thus, the guide
I’ve compiled below is just about the <strong>simplest way to have a LUKS encryption
with dual-boot.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-encryption-is-important">Why encryption is important</h2>

<p>I began using encrypted storage on all my personal computers 5 or 6 years ago
after noticing that all the companies I’d worked for required it, and had good
reason to. Laptops get lost and stolen all the time. They’re high-value items
that are small and easy to carry. And when a thief gets your laptop, there’s
tons of valuable information on it that they can use or sell. Even if you use a
password to log in, it’s easy for an attacker to gain access to your data if
your disk isn’t encrypted – for example, by using a live USB stick. And once
they have that data, they might get access to online accounts, bank statements,
emails, and tons of other data. For me, an encrypted hard disk isn’t optional
anymore – its a necessity.</p>

<h2 id="an-overview">An Overview</h2>

<p>So what are we going to do? This tutorial will help you set up a system to
<strong>dual-boot Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10</strong>. (I haven’t tested it, but it should
work with most other modern versions (~16.04+) of Ubuntu or Windows.) The system
will use a GPT hard disk with UEFI (your BIOS must support UEFI). The Ubuntu
partition will be encrypted with LUKS.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The Windows partition can optionally
be encrypted with BitLocker. I’m going to keep the Ubuntu installation as close
to a “default” installation as possible – no fancy tricks like a separate
<code>/home</code> partition, but it should be somewhat easy to add that yourself if you
really want to.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a blank hard disk, installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu
from scratch. If you already have Windows installed and you want to keep it, you
should be able to shrink your windows partition and join us in phase 3 (though
you might want to skim phases 1 and 2 to understand what we did).</p>

<p>To give you a broad overview of where we’re headed, here’s what we’re going to
do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare the installation media and computer</li>
  <li>Install Windows 10</li>
  <li>Create an encrypted partition for Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Install Ubuntu</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, as with any new OS installation, you should back up any important
data before proceeding. <strong>The instructions below will erase all the data on your
hard disk.</strong> Proceed at your own risk; I’m not responsible for any damage or
data loss.</p>



<p>Since we’re installing both Windows 10 and Ubuntu from scratch, we’ll need a USB
stick for each. If you don’t already have a computer running Ubuntu or Windows,
making the installation media will be a little harder – but there are tutorials
for that and I’ll let you figure it out on your own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Windows Installer USB stick.  The easiest way is to use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/">Windows
10 Media Creation Tool</a> from a
computer that’s already running Windows.</li>
  <li>Create an Ubuntu 20.04 USB stick. The easiest way is to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">download the
ISO</a> and use the Startup Disk Creator on a
computer that’s already running Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Great! We’ve got our USB sticks ready to go! One final thing before we get
started – we need to make sure our BIOS is set up correctly. In particular, we
want to make sure we’re using UEFI to boot our OS.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/dell-bios.jpg" alt="The Dell BIOS"></p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Ensure your computer is running the latest BIOS available. This is important
because an out-of-date BIOS can have bugs, and those bugs sometimes affect
things like UEFI, non-Windows operating systems, or other components we’ll be
touching.</li>
  <li>Edit your BIOS settings. The following names are probably specific to Dell
BIOS, but other manufacturers will have similar settings.
    <ol>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Boot Sequence</code>, make sure your <code>Boot
List Option</code> is set to <code>UEFI</code>.</li>
      <li>Under <code>General</code> and <code>Advanced Boot Options</code>, I disabled
<code>Legacy Option ROMs</code>. It’s important that both OSes install in UEFI mode.
(You can probably enable this when installation is complete if you care).</li>
      <li>Under <code>Security</code>, <code>TPM Security</code> must be enabled if you
want to easily set up BitLocker in Windows.</li>
      <li>I disabled <code>Secure Boot</code>. I’m not sure if this is absolutely required, and
you can try leaving it on or re-enabling it when you’re done if you want.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that our BIOS is configured for UEFI, we’re going to set up our hard disk.</p>

<div>
<p><b>For this tutorial, your BIOS must support UEFI!</b></p>
<p>Most modern computers support this, but if yours doesn't this tutorial won't
work for you. You should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing only Linux with encryption using the graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Installing only Windows with encryption.</li>
  <li>OR Dual-booting Linux and Windows without encryption using Ubuntu's graphical installer.</li>
  <li>OR Finding another tutorial or figuring out how to do this with an MBR disk.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="5">
  <li><strong>Completely erase</strong> your hard disk and set it up for UEFI by doing the
following.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
    <ol>
      <li>Boot your Ubuntu USB stick and use <code>Try without installing</code>.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal. Make it fullscreen while you’re at it.</li>
      <li>Figure out what your primary hard disk is called. It will probably be
either <code>/dev/sda</code> or <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>. Importantly, it’s <strong>not</strong> <code>/dev/sda1</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code> – those are partitions of the disk. One way to figure out what
yours is called is to run <code>lsblk</code> and look at the disk size. Throughout the rest
of this guide, I’m going to refer to <code>/dev/sda</code>. <strong>If yours is not
<code>/dev/sda</code>, replace <code>/dev/sda</code> with your own (perhaps <code>/dev/sdb</code> or
<code>/dev/nvme0n1</code>) for the rest of this guide.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <p>Run the following commands. This will initialize the drive as a GPT drive
and create a 550M EFI system partition formatted as FAT32.</p>

        <div><div><pre><code>$ sudo su
# sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sda
# sgdisk --new=1:0:+550M /dev/sda
# sgdisk --change-name=1:EFI /dev/sda
# sgdisk --typecode=1:ef00 /dev/sda
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sda1
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>OK, phase 1’s complete. We have our installation media ready to go and the
computer’s BIOS and hard drive is set up correctly. Next, we’ll install Windows.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-install-windows">Phase 2: Install Windows</h2>

<p>In this phase, we’re going to install Windows. Note that when we do this, we’re
going to leave some unallocated space to install Linux later. This is a good
approach because the Windows installer will mess with our partitions a little
bit, and its easier to let it do so before finalizing our Linux partitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mikekasberg.com/images/dual-boot-encryption/windows-installer.jpg" alt="The Windows installer"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Boot from your Windows Installer USB stick.</li>
  <li>Choose a <code>Custom (advanced)</code> install to get to the Windows partitioning tool.</li>
  <li>Create a new partition. The size of this partition should be the amount of
disk space you want to use for Windows. In this example, I did 80G since the SSD
on my computer is relatively small. If unsure, do about half of your hard
disk.</li>
  <li>Windows will warn you that it is going to create an extra system partition.
This is good.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>Install Windows onto the partition you just made. There’s no need to format
any partitions – the Windows installer will take care of that for you.</li>
  <li>When the Windows installation is finished, log in and enable BitLocker on
drive <code>C:</code>. This will automatically create yet another partition on your disk
(a Windows recovery partition) - which is why we’re doing it before
partitioning for Ubuntu.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, you can start using Windows. But I’d avoid doing too much setup
or personalization yet so you don’t have to do it again if something goes wrong
below. If you want to double check your partitions, this is what you’ll be left
with after installing Windows and enabling BitLocker:</p>

October 27, 2020 | https://linus.coffee/note/no-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://linus.coffee/note/no-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>To talk about what no-code is good for, we need to first take a digression on what makes no-code fundamentally different from “yes-code” software.</p>
<h2 id="the-grain-of-abstractions">The grain of abstractions</h2>
<p>Software – yes-code software – has been around for a while. One of the things we’ve learned as an industry is how to write software <em>that gracefully evolves</em>. We’re not perfect – sad, legacy systems still proliferate – but we as a technical industry have learned how to build and evolve software systems against changing requirements and constraints that span years and decades.</p>
<p>When we first solve a problem with software, we write some code against the constraints of that particular day. We don’t necessarily know how the problem is going to change. Maybe there will be different customers or stakeholders tomorrow, or maybe the product will expand to serve a related, but different, problem space. We need to be able to change software to accommodate changing circumstances without rewriting it, and that is fundamentally what <em>software engineering</em> is: how to change software systems. <em>Change</em> is the name of the game.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten decent at change. We’ve built tools like Git and patterns like continuous integration and code autoformatting to make it easier to change code and remain stable. We’ve learned how to operate large software teams, especially in open source. We’ve also learned to use better abstractions. Abstractions are conceptual wrappers that isolate different parts of a codebase – say, a data source from a user interface – so that one part may change while another doesn’t. In general we have started to figure out how to make the DNA of software systems resilient against the changing tides of time.</p>
<p>No-code seems to reject a lot of those learnings, for better or worse. I haven’t seen any no-code company or product that allows source control (and I’ve seen many no-code companies, but you’re welcome to prove me wrong.) I have yet to find no-code products that allow for natural construction of abstraction between layers of a no-code workflow. No-code software is also scarily ill-prepared for large scale development: we have software systems being worked on by tens of thousands of engineers – what does it look like for a team of 1000 engineers to be working on a set of thousands of no-code workflows? Chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional software has learned the abstractions and patterns that make software resilient and adaptable to change and scale. No-code software is not ready for changing constraints nor development scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, I think no-code has a few niches where making tradeoffs in adaptability and scale allows no-code tools to be much, much better. So, given this, <em>when is no-code useful?</em></p>
<h2 id="1-transitionary-ephemeral-software">1. Transitionary, ephemeral software</h2>
<p>The obvious answer, and one I had before our conversation, was <em>transitionary</em> software, software with <em>a defined lifetime</em>. If your software system has a finite, pre-defined lifetime and team, it doesn’t need to worry about changing constraints or team growth. It just needs to worry about solving a problem well, now.</p>
<p>Lots of software has predictably finite lifetime: a product prototype for an early-stage company, a game or app used as a part of an interactive online ad, a quick sketch or solution to patch a particularly urgent problem in a product, an app built for an event or a conference or a recruiting cycle or a quarterly goal tracker… all of these are projects with a pre-defined, maximum lifetime. They don’t need to last or grow or change – they just need to work now, and by giving up some of the adaptability of software abstractions of code, no-code software benefits from way faster prototyping speed. This is a plus.</p>
<p>I think we see lots of finite-time software in transitions. Transitions from having no product to having a product, in a prototype. Transitions in the process of brainstorming a solution and trying multiple designs. Software with a finite shelf life is a good fit for no-code tools.</p>
<h2 id="2-high-churn-code">2. High-churn code</h2>
<p>There’s another category of software for which long-term maintainability matters little – code with high churn.</p>
<p>By high churn, I mean that requirements are changing almost daily, and very little of the code written today will exist in a month or a quarter’s time. If the code you write today doesn’t have to last and evolve, because something new is going to take its place tomorrow, what matters is the speed to build, not resilience to change.</p>
<p>There’s lots of high-churn code in businesses. Marketing websites and landing pages, data pipelines for analytics, e-commerce storefronts, marketing campaigns, payment portals – requirements for these kinds of solutions change quickly enough that code is constantly being rewritten, and if code needs to <em>be replaced</em> more than it needs to <em>last</em>, no-code tools are a great fit.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-same-mistakes">Avoiding the same mistakes</h2>
<p>I think “no-code” is a misnomer. It leads us to think that no-code software is the start of a trend in which general software will involve less coding, and software engineering will become easier. This is not the case. Software engineering is not about building solutions, it’s about evolving them. But change resiliency over time is not the focus of no-code tools, and I think that’s ok.</p>
<p>I think no-code tools are instead an extension of a different trend: <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/text/">reifying workflows</a>. Business processes and workflows used to be documented in Word docs strewn about the office or on a shared folder, or even just passed down by oral tradition in companies. Now, we have tools that allow us to build these workflows, talk about them, edit them, and share them more concretely. This is a huge boon for more repeatable business processes and for getting things done quickly! I think this is the true win of no-code tools: concretizing workflows.</p>
<p>If no-code wants to be a serious competitor against “traditional” software – though I don’t think it should try – no-code needs to learn from the mistakes of early software. No-code tools need to understand that products and software systems need to live on for decades against changing teams and requirements, and against products and companies and standards that die out and get replaced. This requires a cultural shift, a tooling shift, and a new class of abstractions in our toolbelt as no-code engineers. Anytime we try to introduce more tooling and abstraction to no-code, I think no-code gets just a little more “code” in it. And perhaps that’ll bring us right back to where we started, discovering that code is good.</p>
<p>After all, the world is complex. And when we build software against the complexity of the world, that <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/complexity-conservation/">complexity needs to go somewhere</a>. Software is complex, but only as much as the world it attempts to make sense of.</p>
<p>It feels like we’re getting off the edge of a discovery phase of no-code, and into a time when we’re starting to understand what problems no-code tools are great for. I think it’s important that no-code tool builders focus on those strengths, or risk falling into the trap of repeating the software industry’s mistakes from the ground up.</p>

<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story. They’ve been ghosted by candidates. They’ve spent hours trying to convince people to talk to them. They’ve spent even more time getting candidates to the offer stage, only to lose out to the FAANG / startup-du-jour.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re an engineer (no matter how brilliant) who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A …</li></ul></div></article></main></section></div></div>

<p>Our friends over at ICmasters have delved into the package of the Apple A14 Bionic. The die size has been unmasked, and it stands in at 88mm<sup>2</sup>. Despite cramming in 11.8 billion transistors, the die size is incredibly small thanks to utilization of TSMC’s 5nm process node.</p>

<p>The march of progress is not all rosy. Apple’s chips have historically achieved 90%+ of the process node’s theoretical density in their processors. This generation stands out by missing that mark by a large amount. A14 comes in at a cool 78% effective transistor density when compared to theoretical density. Despite TSMC claiming a 1.8x shrink for N5, Apple only achieves a 1.49x shrink.</p>

<p>This is not due to a failure of TSMC or Apple. These companies are clear leaders for the manufacturing and design of semiconductors respectively. Instead, this failure to convert theoretical to effective density stems from the slow death of SRAM scaling. SRAM is extensively used throughout a processor from registers to caches. Geoffrey Yeap of TSMC claims that the typical mobile SoC which consists of 60% logic, 30% SRAM, and 10% analog/IO.</p>

<p>TSMC’s N5 node diverges from prior shrinks by showing signs of slowing SRAM scaling. Despite being a full shrink with logic, the SRAM is a 1.35x shrink. This figure is overstated as it will end up being even lower once other the other assist circuitry is accounted for. Hence TSMC’s guidance of chip area reduction at 35%-40% with N5. SemiAnalysis expects this to be a trend that will persist with new nodes. TSMC and Samsung are already demonstrating 3D stacked SRAM which will help alleviate the issue of density.</p>

<p>3D Stacking is not the silver bullet. Cost scaling has begun slowing dramatically. With TSMC N5 wafer pricing in the ~$17k range, it is clear cost per transistor has not fallen. Even if SRAM scaling kept up, the cost per transistor would still have remained flat from N7 to N5.</p>

			<p>Administrators can use teams policies for controlling what users can do in Microsoft Teams.</p>

<p>In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.</p>





<p>Policies are used in Microsoft Office 365 and Azure AD for securing access to services and data. Besides the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/identity-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">common identity and device access policies</a>,
Microsoft has provided a set of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/teams-access-policies?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank">Teams specific policies</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teams and channel policies</li>
<li>Messaging policies</li>
<li>Meeting policies</li>
<li>App permission policies</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, administrators can configure Teams so that external users are not able to edit or delete any messages they’ve sent. Or, an owner of a Teams site can disable message editing for members of a certain channel.</p>



<h2 id="initial-discovery">Initial discovery</h2>

<p>While I was working with the previous version (v0.4.4) of <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals" target="_blank">AADInternals</a> Teams functions I noticed an interesting thing: I was able to edit and delete chat messages using AADInternals as a guest
even when it was not allowed.</p>

<p>This led to a question that <strong>what if the policies are applied only at the client end?</strong> In practice this would mean that the Teams service tells to your Teams client that “Though shall not edit messages!” but the client
could still do so.</p>

<h2 id="observing-teams-client-behaviour">Observing Teams client behaviour</h2>

<p>I started by watching what was going on between the client and cloud when the Teams client started. The first observation was that the client made about 120 http requests to the cloud.
While browsing through those requests, I spotted one that caught my interest (headers stripped):</p>

<pre><code>POST https://teams.microsoft.com/api/mt/part/emea-02/beta/users/useraggregatesettings HTTP/1.1

{
    "tenantSettingsV2": true,
    "userResourcesSettings": true,
    "messagingPolicy": true,
    "clientSettings": true,
    "targetingPolicy": true,
    "tenantSiteUrl": true,
    "userPropertiesSettings": true,
    "callingPolicy": true,
    "meetingPolicy": true,
    "educationAssignmentsAppPolicy": true
}
</code></pre>

<p>The response contained all the settings and policies the Teams client is allowed to do as the logged in user. Below can be seen the <strong>messagingPolicy</strong> section:
</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span></span><span>"messagingPolicy"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>"value"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
		<span>"allowUserEditMessage"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>

		<span>"allowRemoveUser"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
		<span>"allowSmartReply"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>What we can learn here is that the Teams client asks from the cloud what the current user is allowed to do, which was the expected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="testing-in-action">Testing in action</h2>

<p>Next I decided to try whether I could lie to Teams client:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saved the response from above to be used as a baseline.</p></li>

<li><div><p>I created a new Messaging policy to disable editing and deleting of sent messages.</p><p>
I applied the policy to a single demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies1.png" alt="Custom policy"></p><p>Now I had two policies, the default organisation wide and the restricted one for demo user:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies2.png" alt="Policies"></p></div></li>

<li><p>I restarted the Teams client and noticed that the editing and deleting were correctly disabled (didn’t exists).</p></li>

<li><div><p>I compared the returned policies from the <strong>useraggregatesettings</strong> requests<br>
and as we can see, the request was missing two lines:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies3.png" alt="Policy comparison"></p></div></li>

<li><div><p>I closed the client and configured Fiddler to do an autoresponse using the saved http response from above:</p><p>
<img src="https://o365blog.com/images/posts/teams-policies4.png" alt="Fiddler autoresponse"></p><p>
Now, when the client is requesting the settings file, it will be served the one that allows editing and deleting.</p></div></li>

<li><p>I started the Teams client and <strong>the editing and deleting were again allowed</strong> and I was able to edit and delete (my own) messages!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What we can lean here is that <strong>we can lie to Teams client</strong> and change its behaviour 😂 <br>
Moreover, we learnt that <strong>Teams policies are applied only on the client</strong> 🤦‍♂</p>

<p>Here is the video demonstrating this with <strong>AADInternals</strong> and <strong>Fiddler</strong> (sorry for the bad audio after 03:20):</p>

</div>

<p>Below is a video that shows in action that this works also with <strong>cloud file storage restrictions</strong>:<br></p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a32TkLIBwS4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<br><strong>Note:</strong> Although not seen on the video, I was able to add my Google Drive account to Teams so this is not just a UI thing.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the “uncompliant” Teams client behaviour can not be detected.</p>

<p>Same verdict with protecting. Well, one could try to use Conditional Access (CA) with device ownership and compliance restrictions, but that doesn’t cover all scenarios.</p>



<p>Our little test here proves that <strong>Teams policies are applied ONLY on the client!</strong>.</p>

<p>If the user (or guest) is utilising Teams APIs directly, using for instance AADInternals <a href="https://o365blog.com/aadinternals/#teams-functions" target="_blank">Teams functionality</a>, he or she can bypass the restrictions set by the policies.
However, this is not a bug or vulnerability as such, but a (very very bad) design choice by Microsoft.</p>

<p>Users can do at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bypass messaging policies</li>
<li>Bypass cloud file storage restrictions</li>
<li>Bypass meetings policies</li>
</ul>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Teams policies are NOT a security measure and organisations should not rely on them!</strong> ⚠️</p>

In fact, Tem published the first Notion website back in March 2020 (oh, how the world has changed). </span></span></p><p><span><span>Thanks in large to awesome projects like Super and Fruition, building websites on Notion became easier and faster. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Given the surge in popularity, I deciced to pen this comprehensive guide and create some duplicable blocks, so you can create your own Notion website in no time — enjoy 🙌</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="cc149452e88b42e8b29622443a589d9c"></span><span><span>🔑 An overview of the guide</span></span></h2><div id="c496b9ce8126498e85222feb210e850b"><div id="4e7f6e020650473a8d103736b9068090"><p><span><span>Making a landing page with Notion is easy to the point of enjoyable — you don't need any coding skills at all. It's also flexible — you can mix, match, and style various blocks to get the look and feel needed to present your idea (or product) just the right way.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This guide will walk you through every step of setting up your landing with Notion, publishing it to the web, adding analytics and custom styling. As a cherry on top, we've also curated 10 ready-made components that you can use to get your Notion landing page out in no time.</span></span></p></div></div><h2><span id="4b158c7e538e49518051b4d9b3d1f780"></span><span><span>🎯 Setting your landing page goals</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Landing pages are the best way to "sell" something, to tell people about a specific product, service or a resource, and make them do a specific action. </span></span></p><p><span><span>When user does an action, this is called "conversion", and usually landing pages are fine-tuned to get as much conversions as possible. Conversions could be anything: from subscribing to a newsletter or joining a community, to buying a product or a service. Landing pages can be purely informational, too. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Think what's the purpose of your page, and what the user needs to do to contribute.</span></span></p><h2><span id="cbfc301b7d274e27a06afc720d7eb511"></span><span><span>🤔 Deciding on what to show on the landing page</span></span></h2><p><span><span>Defining your goal was the hard part — after you know what action you want the user to make, it's easy to define what to show on your landing. </span></span></p><p><span><span>If they're subscribing to a newsletter, tell what it's about. If the goal is to grow a community, tell about the people already there and show what's the purpose of this community. If you're selling a product, focus on the value it offers and on core functionality. Don't forget call-to-actions to let the user actually realize their interest when they're convinced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Take a look at </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demandcurve.com/#1opac8uusrjldfqjb39wpp">Demand Curve</a></span><span>'s landing page, for example. </span></span></p><div id="54fa9f431f9a45fc970d6e7fc90bf338"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/32e404a1-908e-4e9d-a0ca-dcce9c1e5edf.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>They're advertising their start-up program, focusing on what the program is about, how it's structured and why people learn valuable things during that program. It's all there — right on the first screen you can see the bullet points describing what the program is about (Growth Strategy, Ads, etc.).</span></span></p><p><span><span>Demand Curve's team also put a special emphasis on social proof — there's a ton of different testimonials and stories from people on the page.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes short landing pages that span 1-2 screens have higher conversion that longer ones, that span 3 and more screens. When you need your user to perform a simple action, like sharing their email, a short page works better. Short landings also make more sense for "warm" clients who already know what you are offering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Longer landings with lots of information work better for "cold" clients, because they need more context. After you have an idea on what size is appropriate in your case, you can start experimenting with content.</span></span></p><h2><span id="3812d49b74904f9d961961ff3c8b07b9"></span><span><span>🖋️ Adding some content</span></span></h2><p><span><span>On a typical landing page, the information is arranged into standard "blocks" with valuable information:  there's an eye-catching Hero image, simple text blocks describing your value proposition, a call-to-action that lets you collect interest, and a footer with terms. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Like on </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.refactoringgrowth.com/">Refactoring Growth</a></span><span>'s landing page, you have an elaborate introduction, several sections with a value proposition (simple text) block and a picture or a graphic, a pricing block and a Call-to-Action.</span></span></p><div id="c32142c387d44b52b7995b22ae6c17c9"><picture><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750&amp;f=webp" media="(max-width: 414px)" type="image/webp"><source src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=750" media="(max-width: 414px)"><source srcset="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500&amp;f=webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://api.super.so/asset/optemization.com/381f703e-7f47-4032-8bcb-2105ba4ea2b0.png?w=1500" alt="image" loading="lazy"></picture></div><p><span><span>Optionally, you can add more useful stuff.

Select "Turn into", then "text". You've got your landing page! Add some space between the blocks, change the content and delete the toggle. Then customize it as you like.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Here's a 53-second demo: </span></span></p><p><span><span>Mix and match the blocks and add your own section to make your own converting landing page in 10 minutes.</span></span></p><h2><span id="dbfa3c0dca5f4aada94f5376166f8281"></span><span><span>🌐 Publish your page to the web </span></span></h2><p><span><span>It's easy to publish your page and make it accessible from a custom domain. 
We like two services: </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">Fruition</a></span><span> is free and open-source, while </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://super.so/">Super</a></span><span> offers more functionality and better performance. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Fruition has a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fruitionsite.com/">very elaborate guide</a></span><span> right on their home page, and a </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw0x54PzCaI">video tutorial</a></span><span>, and Super gives a good onboarding when you sign up, leading you through all the necessary steps. 

</span><span><span>Here's a step-by-step to get you going on Super:</span></span></span></p><ol><li id="30fa5f0ef68b4ad79354c951f1b9aba1"><span><span>Sign up, select a plan (essentially boils down to how many sites you need, keep in mind that one site can have many subpages, like any website on the Web)
</span></span></li><li id="787193987a0b4c7c95437a027e1bd716"><span><span>Select whether you want to make a static website out of your page, or go with a default Notion-based method. 

First option offers great performance, but doesn't allow for filtered views and calendars on your page. 

Default Notion page is relatively poor in terms of performance and SEO, but all Notion functionality will work and it's still enough for simple personal websites or pages where you don't need fast loading.
</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="e44a993f1fce466193429d780f87fd90"><span><span>Select your site name used in Super, a custom domain from a domain provider, and the URL to your original Notion page with the page set to public via the "Share" menu at the top ("Share" → "Share to the Web")
</span></span></li><li id="2aa6fd185ae9449084ed3674d150ac83"><span><span>Add one or more pretty URLs if you need them. By default, all the sub-pages you add inside your home page will have ugly Notion URLs. You can change that by providing links to sub-pages you want to add slugs to and specifying the slug (e.g. </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/preconceived">optemization.com/preconceived</a></span><span>)
</span></span></li><li id="ff4df464b80145149fe1675f38702e2b"><span><span>Add A and CNAME records to point Super to your domain name (Super provides these and you need to enter them in your domain provider's control panel). You can also provide an API Key if it's GoDaddy.</span></span></li><ol></ol><li id="52d2dce988b94c798bc7fafc30303552"><span><span>Enter your site's description, attach an image and an icon for social sharing. You can also select a custom font for your page's contents at this point.
</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Voila! The site should now be public. You're awesome.</span></span></p><h2><span id="728b3a07a7f3429b818b7992351d8dfa"></span><span><span>🔢 Add analytics</span></span></h2><p><span><span>With both Super and Fruition, you can inject your own Javascript into your page. This means you can use most of analytics solutions available.</span></span></p><p><span><span>For example, you can get your Fathom Analytics script to inject by going to Settings → Site → Site ID. Here's their own Fathom's </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://usefathom.com/support/tracking">instruction</a></span><span>. Google Analytics also has a global site tag you can inject. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Both look like this (from Super's landing):</span></span></p><pre id="c777ed719650472ea7f2d1bb17322dd3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>script src</span><span>=</span><span>"https://cdn.analytics.com"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><p><span><span>After you copy and paste the script into the right field in Super or with Fruition, it should should auto-magically start collecting your stats and you'll be able to see them in your analytics dashboard. These are statistics we measure for </span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://optemization.com/">optemization.com</a></span><span>:</span></span></p><h2><span id="4b1780ab79904f75abb4ecda48f54fd6"></span><span><span>✨Add styling </span></span></h2><p><span><span>In theory, with Super or Fruition you can style practically any part of your page. One of the simple things to do is to change default Notion colors. To change any color on your page just add a script (the same way you add an analytics script) that replaces Notion's CSS values.</span></span></p><p><span><span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://demo.super.so/guides/colors">Super</a></span><span> has a great mini-guide on doing that, below is the script with every default Notion color. Just replace the color you want to change with a HEX value (#000 for black, #fff for white) and delete the rest to change colors for a site hosted with Super (Fruition works the same way).</span></span></p><details id="cd15c584098c4a26b2e6aeadc95bd312"><summary><span><span>Notion's core colors (check the full list here: </span><span><span><a id="/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7" href="https://optemization.com/fed8e0f6059d469fadaeeac47812b6e7"><div><p><img src="https://super.so/icon/dark/hexagon.svg" alt="Notion Colors"></p><p><span><span>Notion Colors</span></span></p></div></a></span></span><span>)</span></span></summary><div><pre id="675898bed12c4045ac7bdd3c20ed3ae3"><code><span><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>style</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

                                                  <div>
                                                                                        <p><span><span>A research team at the University of Calgary’s <a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/">Cumming School of Medicine</a> (CSM) led by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen, PhD, has made an exciting breakthrough with the potential to prevent and reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The team discovered that limiting the open time of a channel called the ryanodine receptor, which acts like a gateway to cells located in the heart and brain, reverses and prevents progression of Alzheimer’s disease in animal models. They also identified a drug that interrupts the disease process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The effect of giving the drug to animal models was remarkable: After one month of treatment, the memory loss and cognitive impairments in these models disappeared. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The significance of identifying a clinically used drug that acts on a defined target to provide anti-Alzheimer’s disease benefits can’t be overstated,” says Chen, a member of the <a href="https://libin.ucalgary.ca/">Libin Cardiovascular Institute</a> and the <a href="https://hbi.ucalgary.ca/">Hotchkiss Brain Institute</a> at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>Dr. Jinjing Yao, PhD, a student of Chen, is the first author of the study.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The results of this groundbreaking study were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31158-X"><em>Cell Reports</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This work is potentially highly impactful as more than half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, suffering memory loss and other cognitive impairments with a negative impact on quality of life. </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><span><span>The science behind the findings</span></span></span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Previous research has shown that the progression of Alzheimer’s disease is driven by a vicious cycle of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) inducing hyperactivity at the neuron level. However, the mechanism behind this wasn’t fully understood nor were there effective treatments to stop the cycle. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen’s team used a portion of an existing drug used for heart patients, carvedilol, to treat mice models with Alzheimer’s symptoms. After a month of treatment, researchers tested animal models with very promising results. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“We treated them for a month and the effect was quite amazing,” says Chen, explaining the drug was successful in reversing major symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. “We couldn’t tell the drug-treated disease models and the healthy models apart.” </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Chen, a Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher, is optimistic about the future of this research, noting the next step will be clinical trials in people.</span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span>Wayne Chen is a professor in the Department&nbsp;of Physiology and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and </span></span><span><span>Molecular Biology at the CSM.&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><span><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>Led by the&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.hbi.ucalgary.ca/"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></em><a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/research/brain-and-mental-health"><em><span><span><span><span><span>Brain and Mental Health</span></span></span></span></span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>&nbsp;is one of six research strategies guiding the University of Calgary toward its&nbsp;Eyes High&nbsp;goals.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>“Legacy Code is code without tests”</p></blockquote><p>If you’ve come across that definition, it’s from Michael Feathers’ book: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=working+effectively+with+legacy+code">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a>.</p><p>While I have <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/">a slightly extended definition</a>, this is a very valid and useful one!</p><p>Feathers’ book is from 2004. Yet, its content doesn’t get outdated. There is a reason for that and <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2019/03/13/like-a-good-wine">this CommitStrip</a> puts it best:</p><p><img src="https://understandlegacycode.com/assets/legacy-code-commitstrip.png" alt="Working Effectively with Legacy Code is like a good wine: it gets better with age"></p><p>This book is a reference. Probably THE reference.</p><p>When there’s a thread about Legacy Code, it doesn’t take long for someone to drop a comment suggesting you read it.</p><blockquote><p>I didn’t read it. I’ve seen it’s recommended. But what are the key points of that book?</p></blockquote><p>If that’s you, I got your back!</p><p>Here’s my summary of the salient points of the book and how they can help you deal with your existing codebase.</p><h2 id="first-add-tests-then-do-your-changes"><a href="#first-add-tests-then-do-your-changes" aria-label="first add tests then do your changes permalink"></a>First, add tests, then do your changes</h2><p>The challenge with changing existing code is to preserve the existing behavior.</p><p>When code is not tested, how do you know you didn’t break anything?</p><p>You need <strong>feedback</strong>. Automated feedback is the best. Thus, this is the first thing you need to do: write the tests.</p><p>Only then you’ll be safe to change the code and refactor.</p><p>Your goal is to get there. The point of the book is to show you <em>how</em> you can get there when you have to deal with an impossibly convoluted codebase. Which leads us to the next point…</p><h2 id="adding-tests-the-legacy-code-dilemma"><a href="#adding-tests-the-legacy-code-dilemma" aria-label="adding tests the legacy code dilemma permalink"></a>Adding tests: the Legacy Code dilemma</h2><p>Before you change code, you should have tests in place. But to put tests in place, you have to change code.</p><p>This is the paradox of Legacy Code!</p><p>So, how do you go about it? Are you doomed?</p><p>You’re not. But you should be extra careful until you got tests in place. You should perform minimal, safe refactorings.</p><p><strong>Change as little code as possible to get tests in place.</strong></p><p>The recipe is:</p><ol><li>Identify change points (Seams)</li><li>Break dependencies</li><li>Write the tests</li><li>Make your changes</li><li>Refactor</li></ol><p>Once you get to the tests, you know how to proceed. The first two points are the difficult ones.</p><h2 id="identify-seams-to-break-your-code-dependencies"><a href="#identify-seams-to-break-your-code-dependencies" aria-label="identify seams to break your code dependencies permalink"></a>Identify Seams to break your code dependencies</h2><p>Adding tests on the existing code can be challenging.</p><p>Hell, it’s usually a nightmare!</p><p>That’s because the code was not written to be <em>testable</em> in the first place. 99% of the time, this is a dependency problem: the code you want to test can’t run because it needs <em>something</em> hard to put in the test.</p><p>Sometimes it’s a database connection. Sometimes it’s a call to a third-party server. Sometimes it’s a parameter that’s complex to instantiate. Usually, it’s a complex mix of all that.</p><p>To test your code, you need to <strong>break these dependencies</strong> in the tests.</p><p>Therefore, you need to identify <strong>Seams</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>“A Seam is a place to alter program behavior, without changing the code.”</p></blockquote><p>There are different types of Seams. The gist of it is to identify how you can change the code behavior without touching the source code.</p><p>If your language is Object-Oriented, the most common and convenient Seam is an object.</p><p>Consider this piece of JavaScript code:</p><pre data-language="js" data-index="0"><p><code><span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseConnector</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>// A lot of code…</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>connect</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// Perform some calls to connect to the DB.</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></p></pre><p>Say the <code>connect()</code> method is causing you problems when you try to put code into tests. Well, the whole class is a Seam you can alter.</p><p>You can extend this class in tests to prevent it from connecting to an actual DB:</p><pre data-language="js" data-index="1"><p><code><span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>FakeDatabaseConnector</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>DatabaseConnector</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>connect</span><span>() {</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>// Override the problematic calls to the DB</span></span>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the field of computer science, the Paxos algorithm is notorious for how difficult it is to understand. I had to learn the Paxos algorithm in my distributed systems class. I even have "implemented" it by translating Leslie Lamport's TLA+ to Python. But I didn't understand it until much much later.</p>

<p>Now I have a better understanding of Paxos than I used to, I want to explain it to other people. Not because I'd like to help people, rather, I find that explaining things is a very good way to find blind spots in my own understanding.</p>

<p>So, where do we start? Personally, I dislike explanations that start with a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm, followed by a proof of why those steps do what they claim to do. Instead, I much prefer to start with the problem the algorithm tries to solve, then iteratively come up with a solution together with the reader. So that's what I am going to do. And now you understand the title.</p>

<p><em>Small disclaimer:</em> The glossaries used in this article is different from what is commonly used for Paxos. I just picked the ones that made the most sense for my narrative.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The distributed consensus problem is widely useful, so the reader probably doesn't need to be motivated. Here I will just simply state the problem.</p>

<p>There is a group of agents (let's call them $\sc{CLIENT}s$), who want to choose a number among their selections. Any number is fine, as long as everyone agrees on the same number.</p>

<p>Here, there are a few assumptions we will make to make this problem meaningful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the agents - including but not limited to the $\sc{CLIENT}s$, as we will add more types of agents later - are well-behaved. Meaning they all execute the prescribed algorithms faithfully, and don't maliciously try to trick other agents. (If you like jargons: Byzantine failures don't occur.)</li>
  <li>Agents can talk to each other by sending each other messages, but the messages they send to each other could take arbitrarily long before reaching their destination, and might get lost (but never altered).</li>
</ul>

<p>The agents could also "fail". However, failing is equivalent to all messages sent to/from that agent being lost forever. So whether we have this assumption or not won't change the algorithm we come up with.</p>

<p>Also, to not complicate things, we are only solving the "single-round" consensus problem in this article, meaning as the output of this algorithm, all of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ will get a single number which they agree on.</p>

<h2 id="solution-searching-adventure">Solution searching adventure</h2>

<h3 id="iteration-0">Iteration 0</h3>

<p>When trying to solve a complex problem such as this one, it's usually a good idea to start by simplifying the problem.
As a start, let's just ignore the need to be reliable entirely.</p>

<p>If we throw reliability out the window, it should be easy to come up with a very simple solution: we add an agent (let's call it $\sc{COORDINATOR}$).
The $\sc{CLIENTS}$ send whatever number they pick to the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ in a $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ message, where $x$ is the number
proposed by the $i$-th $\sc{CLIENT}$. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ picks an arbitrary proposal (say, $x'$),
and informs the other $\sc{CLIENT}s$ about this decision.
Specifically, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ will just reply with a $\sc{CHOSEN}(x')$ message to all the $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\ldots)$ messages it has
received and will receive.</p>

<p>If we assume no messages ever get lost, it is quite easy to see that every $\sc{CLIENT}$ will get a number. And because only one number is ever chosen, they will all get the same number.</p>

<p>It is also easy to see why this solution is impractical: it has a single point of failure. Once the singular $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ fails, no further progress can be made.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3>

<p>To improve this almost looks easy at first glance: just add more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$!</p>

<p>Sure, more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would remove the single point of failure. However, if there are more than one $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, they might individually make different decisions, which results in the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ having disagreement.</p>

<p>What if we let the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ reach an agreement among themselves before responding? But wait, doesn't that sound familiar? Having a group of agents reaching an agreement, that's exactly what we added the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to solve. We just made the problem cyclic.</p>

<p>Let's take a step back. Is there a way for the clients to reach an agreement without having the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ communicate with each other?</p>

<p>In other words, among the decisions of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$, is there an deterministic algorithm to pick out a specific one that is robust against message losses?</p>

<p>This might sound hard, but it's actually quite simple: pick the decision that is backed by more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>There can't be two decisions both with more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing them; and if a decision doesn't have that many $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ backing it, it won't appear to have more backing $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ through message losses.</p>

<p>Since this approach resembles a majority vote, let's call $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ decisions $\sc{VOTE}(coord_i, x)$ from now on, where $x$ is the number picked by the $i$-th $\sc{COORDINATOR}$. Each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has a single vote, because each of them only makes a single decision.</p>

<p>Obviously, our solution cannot be infinitely reliable. If more than half of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ went down, there will never be a majority reached. But this is already vastly better than our first solution, and the reliability scales with the number of $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$. So we will call it good enough.</p>

<p>Sadly, this solution doesn't actually work: there might not be a majority at all! For example, it's possible that three of the proposals each get a third of the votes. We would have a stalemate in that case.</p>

<h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3>

<p>Again, a solution seems straightforward: just try again in case of a stalemate.</p>

<p>But then again, things aren't that simple.</p>

<p>First of all, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ need to be made aware of a retry. Otherwise, because each $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ only has one vote, they won't be able to vote again even if the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ retry.</p>

<p>To do that, we attach an attempt id to all the messages sent. i.e. $\sc{PROPOSAL}(client_i, x)$ becomes $\sc{PROPOSAL}(\#attempt, client_i, x)$, and so forth. Each time a $\sc{CLIENT}$ retries, it bumps $\#attempt$ to the maximum $\#attempt$ it knows of plus 1. And the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ should only responds to messages with the most recent $\#attempt$.</p>

<p>Hopefully the intent of the $\#attempt$ number is clear. (<a href="https://github.com/yshui/explain-algorithms/issues/new">Let me know</a> if not.)</p>

<p>Are we good now? Unfortunately, no. Consider this scenario:</p>

<p>There were 2 clients. They proposed their numbers, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ voted on them and all agreed on a single number, $x_1$, all is good. But, all of the $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots)$ messages got lost on the way to $client_2$, while $client_1$ received all of the messages just fine. At this point, $client_1$ thought $x_1$ is the number, but $client_2$ went on to retry. The $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ voted again, and got $x_2$. This time, all the messages sent to $client_1$ got lost.</p>

<p>And behold, we got the two clients to disagree.</p>

<p>There is an important insight to be had here. Whenever a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$, say $coord_i$, sends out a $\sc{VOTE}(\ldots, coord_i, x)$, there is a chance that some $\sc{CLIENT}$ would adopt $x$. If $coord_i$ ever sends out two votes with different $x$, there is a chance that some of the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ would disagree.</p>

<p>In other words, once a $\sc{COORDINATOR}$ has revealed its vote, it has to stick to it.</p>

<p>This seems to run contrary to our attempt: if the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ cannot change their votes, what's the point of retrying? A stalemate will be a stalemate forever.</p>

<p>Looks like we reached a dead end with this type of voting. It appears the problem stems from the fact that the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to commit to their votes.</p>

<p>So, what if we introduce a form of non-commitment voting?</p>

<h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3>

<p>Let's explore this idea. Say, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ could now send a $\sc{TENTATIVE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, coord_i, x)$ message, to tentatively vote for $x$.</p>

<p>Obviously, the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ couldn't adopt $x$ right away. So what's this vote good for?</p>

<p>Ah, right, it could get us to a majority.</p>

<p>It is correct that tentative votes don't lead directly to an agreement among $\sc{CLIENT}s$, but it can show us when a majority has formed among the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$.</p>

<p>Once a $\sc{CLIENT}$ sees a majority tentative vote, it can then message the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ to ask for an actual vote. (Let's call this message $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}(\#attempt, client_i)$). Intuitively, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ have to make the same vote in the actual vote as their tentative votes.</p>

<p>If all goes well, we would get a majority and an agreement. If there is no majority, the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ won't even start a vote, so they are free to change their mind. So the $\sc{CLIENT}s$ could start another attempt which might have a different outcome.</p>

<p>What if things don't go well? What if the $\sc{PLEASE}\sc{VOTE}$ messages weren't received by some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$?
In that case, some of the $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ would have voted, and their decisions cannot be changed. That is to say, in all subsequent attempts, these $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ will always vote for what they have voted for, whether it's a tentative vote, or the actual vote. But that doesn't create a problem for us. There was a majority in the tentative votes, and now we solidified part of the tentative votes. There is at least one way we can still reach a majority in the next round: everyone votes the same as they did in this round. And we can prove this inductively for all future rounds.</p>

<p>From this, we can have a rough image of how the algorithm functions: as attempts are being made, more and more $\sc{COORDINATOR}s$ start to make up their mind which number they will commit to, while making sure a majority could still be reached. Eventually, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I love text layout, and have been working with it in one form or other for over 35 years. Yet, knowledge about it is quite arcane. I don’t believe there is a single place where it’s all properly written down. I have some explanation for that: while basic text layout is very important for UI, games, and other contexts, a lot of the “professional” needs around text layout are embedded in <em>much</em> more complicated systems such as Microsoft Word or a modern Web browser.</p>

<p>A complete account of text layout would be at least a small book. Since there’s no way I can write that now, this blog post is a small step towards that – in particular, an attempt to describe the “big picture,” using the conceptual framework of a “loose hierarchy.” Essentially, a text layout engine breaks the input into finer and finer grains, then reassembles the results into a text layout object suitable for drawing, measurement, and hit testing.</p>

<p>The main hierarchy is concerned with laying out the entire paragraph as a single line of text. Line breaking is also important, but has a separate, parallel hierarchy.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-text-layout-hierarchy">The main text layout hierarchy</h2>

<p>The hierarchy is: paragraph segmentation as the coarsest granularity, followed by rich text style and BiDi analysis, then itemization (coverage by font), then Unicode script, and shaping clusters as the finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/layout_pyramid.svg" alt="diagram of layout hierarchy"></p>

<h3 id="paragraph-segmentation">Paragraph segmentation</h3>

<p>The coarsest, and also simplest, segmentation task is paragraph segmentation. Most of the time, paragraphs are simply separated by newline (U+000A) characters, though Unicode in its infinite wisdom specifies a number of code point sequences that function as paragraph separators in plain text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>U+000A LINE FEED</li>
  <li>U+000B VERTICAL TAB</li>
  <li>U+000C FORM FEED</li>
  <li>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN</li>
  <li>U+000D U+000A (CR + LF)</li>
  <li>U+0085 NEXT LINE</li>
  <li>U+2008 LINE SEPARATOR</li>
  <li>U+2009 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</li>
</ul>

<p>In rich text, paragraphs are usually indicated through markup rather than special characters, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> in HTML. But in this post, as in most text layout APIs, we’ll treat rich text as plain text + attribute spans.</p>

<h3 id="rich-text-style">Rich text style</h3>

<p>A paragraph of rich text may contain <em>spans</em> that can affect formatting. In particular, choice of font, font weight, italic or no, and a number of other attributes can affect text layout. Thus, each paragraph is typically broken into a some number of <em>style runs,</em> so that within a run the style is consistent.</p>

<p>Note that some style changes don’t <em>necessarily</em> affect text layout. A classic example is color. Firefox, rather famously, does <em>not</em> define segmentation boundaries here for color changes. If a color boundary cuts a ligature, it uses fancy graphics techiques to render parts of the ligature in different color. But this is a subtle refinement and I think not required for basic text rendering. For more details, see <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/">Text Rendering Hates You</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bidirectional-analysis">Bidirectional analysis</h3>

<p>Completely separate from the style spans, a paragraph may in general contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text. The need for bidirectional (BiDi) text is certainly one of the things that makes text layout more complicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this part of the stack is defined by a standard (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">UAX #9</a>), and there are a number of good implementations. The interested reader is referred to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. The key takeaway here is that BiDi analysis is done on the plain text of the entire paragraph, and the result is a sequence of <em>level runs,</em> where the level of each run defines whether it is LTR or RTL.</p>

<p>The level runs and the style runs are then merged, so that in subsequent stages each run is of a consistent style and directionality. As such, for the purpose of defining the hierarchy, the result of BiDi analysis could alternatively be considered an implicit or derived rich text span.</p>

<p>In addition to BiDi, which I consider a basic requirement, a more sophisticated text layout engine will also be able to handle vertical <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode">writing modes</a>, including mixed cases where short strings are horizontal within the vertical primary direction. Extremely sophisticated layout engines will also be able to handle ruby text and other ways of annotating the main text flow with intercalated strings. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a> for many examples of sophisticated layout requirements; the scope of this blog post really is basic text layout of the kind needed in user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="itemization-font-coverage">Itemization (font coverage)</h3>

<p>Itemization is the trickiest and least well specified part of the hierarchy. There is no standard for it, and no common implementation. Rather, each text layout engine deals with it in its own special way.</p>

<p>Essentially, the result of itemization is to choose a single concrete font for a run, from a <em>font collection.</em> Generally a font collection consists of a main font (selected by font name from system fonts, or loaded as a custom asset), backed by a <em>fallback stack,</em> which are usually system fonts, but thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto</a> it is possible to bundle a fallback font stack with an application, if you don’t mind spending a few hundred megabytes for the assets.</p>

<p>Why is it so tricky? A few reasons, which I’ll touch on.</p>

<p>First, it’s not so easy to determine whether a font can render a particular string of text. One reason is <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a>. For example, the string “é” can be encoded as U+00E9 (in NFC encoding) or as U+0065 U+0301 (in NFD encoding). Due to the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">Unicode equivalence</a>, these should be rendered identically, but a font may have coverage for only one or the other in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cmap">Character to Glyph Index Mapping</a> (cmap) table. The shaping engine has all the Unicode logic to handle these cases.</p>

<p>Of course, realistic fonts with Latin coverage will have both of these particular sequences covered in the cmap table, but edge cases certainly do happen, both in extended Latin ranges, and other scripts such as Hangul, which has complex normalization rules (thanks in part to a Korean standard for normalization which is somewhat at odds with Unicode). It’s worth noting that <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201009-00/?p=104351">DirectWrite gets Hangul normalization quite wrong</a>.</p>

<p>I believe a similar situation exists with the Arabic presentation forms; see <a href="https://www.arabeyes.org/Developing_Arabic_fonts">Developing Arabic fonts</a> for more detail on that.</p>

<p>Because of these tricky normalization and presentation issues, the most robust way to determine whether a font can render a string is to try it. This is how LibreOffice has worked for a while, and in 2015 <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/harfbuzz/2015-October/005168.html">Chromium followed</a>. See also <a href="https://www.chromium.org/teams/layout-team/eliminating-simple-text">Eliminating Simple Text</a> for more background on the Chromium text layout changes.</p>

<p><em>Another</em> whole class of complexity is emoji. A lot of emoji can be rendered with either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Emoji_versus_text_presentation">text or emoji presentation</a>, and there are no hard and fast rules to pick one or the other. Generally the text presentation is in a symbol font, and the emoji presentation is in a separate color font. A particularly tough example is the smiling emoji, which began its encoding life as 0x01 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">Code page 437</a>, the standard 8-bit character encoding of the original IBM PC, and is now U+263A in Unicode. However, the suggested default presentation is text, which won’t do in a world which expects color. Apple on iOS unilaterally chose an emoji presentation, so many text stacks follow Apple’s lead. (Incidentally, the most robust way to encode such emoji is to append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)">variation selector</a> to pin down the presentation.)</p>

<p>Another source of complexity when trying to write a cross-platform text layout engine is querying the system fonts. See <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/skribo/text/2019/04/04/font-fallback.html">Font fallback deep dive</a> for more information about that.</p>

<p>I should note one thing, which might help people doing archaeology of legacy text stacks: it used to be pretty common for text layout to resolve “compatibility” forms such as NFKC and NFKD, and this can lead to various problems. But today it is more common to solve that particular problem by providing a font stack with <em>massive</em> Unicode coverage, including all the code points in the relevant compatibility ranges.</p>

<h3 id="script">Script</h3>

<p>The <em>shaping</em> of text, or the transformation of a sequence of code points into a sequence of positioned glyphs, depends on the script. Some scripts, such as Arabic and Devanagari, have extremely elaborate shaping rules, while others, such as Chinese, are a fairly straightforward mapping from code point into glyph. Latin is somewhere in the middle, starting with a straightforward mapping, but ligatures and kerning are also required for high quality text layout.</p>

<p>Determining script runs is reasonably straightforward - many characters have a Unicode script property which uniquely identifies which script they belong to. However, some characters, such as space, are “common,” so the assigned script just continues the previous run.</p>

<p>A simple example is “hello мир”. This string is broken into two script runs: “hello “ is <code>Latn</code>, and “мир” is <code>Cyrl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="shaping-cluster">Shaping (cluster)</h3>

<p>At this point, we have a run of constant style, font, direction, and script. It is ready for <em>shaping.</em> Shaping is a complicated process that converts a string (sequence of Unicode code points) into positioned glyphs. For the purpose of this blog post, we can generally treat it as a black box. Fortunately, a very high quality open source implementation exists, in the form of HarfBuzz.</p>

<p>We’re not <em>quite</em> done with segmentation, though, as shaping assigns substrings in the input to <a href="https://harfbuzz.github.io/clusters.html">clusters</a> of glyphs. The correspondence depends a lot on the font. In Latin, the string “fi” is often shaped to a single glyph (a ligature). For complex scripts such as Devanagari, a cluster is most often a syllable in the source text, and complex reordering can happen within the cluster.</p>

<p>Clusters are important for <em>hit testing,</em> or determining the correspondence between a physical cursor position in the text layout and the offset within the text. Generally, they can be ignored if the text will only be rendered, not edited (or selected).</p>

<p>Note that these shaping clusters are distinct from grapheme clusters. The “fi” example has two grapheme clusters but a single shaping cluster, so a grapheme cluster boundary can cut a shaping cluster. Since …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Last year we had a three part blog series about Qt's new approach to working with 3D graphics APIs and shading languages: <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-direct3d">part 1</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-2">part 2</a>, <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-quick-on-vulkan-metal-and-direct3d-part-3">part 3</a>. For <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-index.html">Qt Quick</a>, an early, opt-in preview of the new rendering architecture was shipped in Qt 5.14, with some improvements in Qt 5.15. With the release of Qt 6.0 upcoming, let's see what has happened since Qt 5.15. It will not be possible to cover every detail of the graphics stack improvements for Qt Quick here, let alone dive into the vast amount of Qt Quick 3D features, many of which are new or improved in Qt 6.0. Rather, the aim is just to give an overview of what can be expected from the graphics stack perspective when Qt 6.0 ships later this year.</p>
<p>Note that the documentation links refer to the Qt 6 snapshot documentation. This allows seeing the latest C++ and QML API pages, including all changed and new functions, but the content is also not final. These links may also break later on.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>QRhi improvements</h2>
<p>QRhi, the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, is Qt's internal graphics abstraction when 3D APIs, such as OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D, are involved. Compared to 5.15, the main improvements in 6.0 are a lot of polishing fixes here and there, and, most importantly, a large set of performance optimizations. While benefitting Qt Quick as well, these become especially important with Qt Quick 3D when complex scenes with many renderable objects are involved.</p>
<p>With some simplifications, the main layers of the Qt 6.0 graphics stack can be visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png" alt="rhiarch-3" width="800" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 400w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=800&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 800w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1200&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=1600&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 1600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2000&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2000w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/rhiarch-3.png?width=2400&amp;name=rhiarch-3.png 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Shader management</h2>
<p>The Qt Shader Tools module is now a selectable module in the installer. For applications this can be relevant because this is the module that provides the <em>qsb</em> command-line tool (not to be confused with <em>qbs</em>) and its associated CMake build system integration. In addition, the module is a mandatory dependency for Qt Quick 3D at the moment.</p>
<p>Qt 6 no longer uses OpenGL-compatible GLSL source snippets directly. Rather, shaders are all written in Vulkan-style GLSL, then reflected and translated to other shading languages, and finally packaged up into a serializable QShader object that can be consumed by QRhi. The shader preparation pipeline in Qt 6 is the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png" alt="shaderconditioning" width="1280" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=640&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 640w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1280&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1280w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=1920&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 1920w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=2560&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 2560w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3200&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/shaderconditioning.png?width=3840&amp;name=shaderconditioning.png 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>In QML applications using Qt Quick, whenever working with ShaderEffect, or subclassing QSGMaterialShader, the application will need to provide a baked shader pack in form of a .qsb file. These are generated by the <em>qsb</em> tool. This does not however mean that developers have to start dealing with a new tool directly: with the CMake integration one can easily list the vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in CMakeLists.txt via the qt6_add_shaders() CMake function. Invoking qsb and packing the resulting .qsb files into the Qt resource system is then taken care of by the build system.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtshadertools-index.html">the shadertools documentation</a> for an overview of how graphics and compute shaders are handled in Qt 6 and the details of the qsb tool and its CMake integration.</p>
<h2>Direct OpenGL is no more for Qt Quick</h2>
<p>In Qt 5.14 and 5.15, Qt Quick shipped with an optional QRhi-based rendering path that could be enabled by setting the environment variable <em>QSG_RHI</em>. This allowed painless experimenting with the new stack, while keeping the traditional, battle tested direct OpenGL code path the default.</p>
<p>In Qt 6.0 all such switches are gone. There is no way get rendering go directly to OpenGL with Qt Quick scenes. Rather, the new default is the QRhi-based rendering path of the Qt Quick scene graph. Other than the defaults changing, the ways to configure what QRhi backend, and so which graphics API to use are mostly unchanged compared to Qt 5.15. See <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph-renderer.html#rendering-via-the-qt-rendering-hardware-interface">the documentation</a> for details. One difference is better API naming: in C++ code to request, and so effectively tie the application to, a given QRhi backend (and by extension graphics API) is now done through the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#setGraphicsApi">QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()</a> function, whereas in 5.15 this task used to be pushed onto an overload of setSceneGraphBackend(), leading to fairly inaccurate naming.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications, although many applications will not notice any of these. If an application uses neither shader code (ShaderEffect, QSGMaterial) nor does it perform its own rendering with OpenGL directly, there is a very high chance that it will need no migration steps at all. (at least not because of graphics)</p>
<h4>Applications using OpenGL directly</h4>
<p>What about applications that use OpenGL directly in one way or another, and are not interested in functioning with other graphics APIs? For example, applications that use <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickframebufferobject.html">QQuickFramebufferObject</a>, or connect to signals like <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRendering">QQuickWindow::beforeRendering()</a> to inject their own OpenGL rendering under or above the Qt Quick scene. This is when the setGraphicsApi() function mentioned above comes into play for real: if an application wishes, it can always state that it wants OpenGL (or Vulkan, or Metal, or D3D) only, and nothing else. That way it is guaranteed that Qt Quick is going to use the corresponding QRhi backend (or else it will fail to initialize), so the application can safely assume that going directly to OpenGL is safe, because Qt Quick will also end up rendering through OpenGL. Note that this does not exempt the application from having to do other type of porting steps: for example, if it in addition uses ShaderEffect or creates its own custom materials, it will still need to migrate to the new ways of handling shaders and materials.</p>
<h4>QSG* and QQuick* API changes</h4>
<p>The API changes mainly fall into 3 categories. This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather just a peek at some of the important changes. Detailed change lists and porting guides are expected to be available with the final Qt 6.0 release.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Different approach to shaders and materials: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgmaterialshader.html">QSGMaterialShader</a> received a full revamp (matching more or less what the now-removed QSGMaterialRhiShader used to be in 5.14 and 5.15). <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html">ShaderEffect</a> no longer allows inline shader strings. Rather, the vertexShader and fragmentShader properties are URLs, similarly to <span>Image.source</span> and others. They can refer to a local .qsb file, or a .qsb file embedded via the Qt resource system (qrc).</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing OpenGL-specifics from QQuickWindow, QSGTexture, and elsewhere. It should come as no surprise that functions like <em>GLuint textureId()</em>, <em>createTextureFromId(GLuint textureId, ...)</em>, or <em>setRenderTarget(GLuint fboId)</em> are now gone. Adopting (wrapping) an existing OpenGL texture, Vulkan image, Metal texture, or D3D11 texture, or accessing the underlying native texture for a QSGTexture is still perfectly possible, but now is done via a different set of APIs, such as <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-qsgvulkantexture.html">QSGVulkanTexture</a> and the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qnativeinterface-sub-qtquick.html">other similar classes</a>, instances of which are <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgtexture.html?__hstc=233546881.8510e053e4fb66e1a58543a6e9886427.1603454017210.1603454017210.1603454017210.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1603454017210&amp;__hsfp=1285229618#nativeInterface" rel="noopener">queryable from QSGTexure</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><p>Integrating the application's own custom rendering with the graphics API that Qt Quick renders with is fully supported, not just for OpenGL, but also Vulkan, Metal, and D3D11. Due to their nature however, some of these APIs will need more than connecting to one single signal like beforeRendering() or afterRendering(). For example, we now also have <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickwindow.html#beforeRenderPassRecording">beforeRenderPassRecording()</a>. See the relevant section in the <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html#mixing-scene-graph-and-the-native-graphics-api">scenegraph overview docs</a> for more details and links to examples. Finally, the number of native graphics resources queryable via <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qsgrendererinterface.html">QSGRendererInterface</a> has been extended, now covering Vulkan, Metal, and Direct 3D too.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending support for redirecting the Qt Quick scene into an offscreen render target. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/%3Ehttps://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html">QQuickRenderControl</a> and the related infrastructure has been heavily enhanced. This was done not just to enable working with graphics APIs other than OpenGL the same way as in Qt 5 (for example, to render a Qt Quick scene into a Vulkan VkImage without an on-screen window), but also to enable integration with AR/VR frameworks and APIs such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/openxr/">OpenXR</a> (in combination with any of Vulkan, D3D11, or OpenGL). Besides the slightly changed QQuickRenderControl interface, we now have a number of helper classes that improve the configurability of a QQuickWindow: <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendertarget.html">QQuickRenderTarget</a>, <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsdevice.html">QQuickGraphicsDevice</a>, and <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickgraphicsconfiguration.html">QQuickGraphicsConfiguration</a>. These are essential in scenarios where a more fine grained control is needed: integrating with APIs like OpenXR is not always straightforward when an existing rendering engine is involved, with a number of potential chicken-egg problems when it comes to the creation, initialization, and ownership of instance, device, and other graphics objects: Which Vulkan instance should Qt Quick use, or should it create a new one upon initializing the scenegraph for the first time? Which Vulkan physical device or DXGI adapter should Qt Quick pick, or just stay with the default? Which VkDevice extensions should be enabled in addition to what Qt itself needs? What 2D image/texture should rendering target, who creates that and when? The expectation is that Qt 6.0 will be well-prepared and providing the foundations for further exploring the world of AR/VR during the rest of the Qt 6.x series.</p>

<h4>New approach to handling shader code in ShaderEffect</h4>
<p>A comprehensive example of the new approach to shader code in ShaderEffect is the Qt 6 port of the classic Qt 5 Cinematic Experience demo. <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience" rel="noopener">(GitHub repo)</a> This version is ported to CMake and is fully functional with all graphics APIs, including all shader and particle effects.</p>

<p>Looking at the QML source code, for example the code for the <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/blob/master/content/CurtainEffect.qml" rel="noopener">curtain effect </a>shows that indeed it has all inline GLSL strings removed.</p>

<p>Instead, the vertex and fragment shaders now live as <a href="https://github.com/alpqr/qt5-cinematic-experience/tree/master/shaders" rel="noopener">ordinary files in the source tree</a>, not bundled with the application executable anymore.</p>

<p>… or failures are your friends :&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;INTRO&gt;</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/xzJXBgG.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>&lt;/INTRO&gt;</p>
<p>The story behind this whole post is a bit lengthy but I’ll try to be brief 🙂</p>
<p>In August of 2019, I’ve received an email from MrTrinsic. Back then, I didn’t yet know what is coming lol.</p>
<p>It turned out that MrTrinsic is a great Amiga enthusiast and he’d asked me to work on his Amiga 1000 … but no on a standard A1000 but with an Amiga 1000 Phoenix motherboard!</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix Enhanced mobo is an extremely rare motherboard replacement for Amiga 1000. Some people think there were no more than 200 units manufactured, others say it was no more than 2000. I’ve no idea either but still, it is very rare so a magic smoke is not an option lol.</p>
<p>This motherboard is an awesome hack in itself and that is why MrTrinsic refers to it as DIVA 😀</p>
<p>Let me quote an excerpt from one of emails.</p>
<p><em>You should mention or point out more clearly that the Phoenix Board is a … DIVA!<br>It is a hack. Just look at the manual what kind of things you can modify and what kind of headers there are to change stuff.<br>The price is that it has an extremely bad signal quality. Plus, it lacks the Buster-Chip that the Amiga 2000 has.<br>The Phoenix is a bad version of the original A2000 from Braunschweig, which in itself was a hacked and beefed-up version of the A1000.<br>Plus, the Phoenix only has two layers. It’s a nightmare as we have seen.</em></p>
<p>It simply always has some problems like stability and compatibility issues which I’ve tried to sort out.</p>
<p>Phoenix mobo was developed in 1989/1990 by our fellow friends from Australia and was one of the very first crowd-funding campaigns! You can read/watch more on one of my fav websites -&gt; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=476" target="_blank">www.amigalove.com</a></p>
<p>Hardware specs are available here -&gt;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amiga.resource.cx/exp/phoenix" target="_blank"> amiga.resource.cx</a></p>
<h4>The plan</h4>
<p>Initially, MrTrinsic asked me to work on some external floppy replacements by Dell which I will cover in another post. Once I’ve figured out that floppy drive issue he’d decided we should start working on The Phoenix project.</p>
<p>At first, he’d send me a large box with gear that he wanted to have in this Amiga. I was like OMG! Not only Phoenix but the whole large project was about to begin!</p>
<p>The plan was to run lots of modern hardware add-ons with Amiga 1000 Phoenix and later try to squeeze it into a nice looking case, plus make it alive and stable.</p>
<p>The first package arrived and I was really excited by what I’ve seen.</p>
<p>Amiga 1000 Phoenix in an A1000 case with lots of mods and hacks already installed, plus, tons of other hardware mods still in boxes … and that was only for starters …</p>

<p>Obviously, the original plan was to MAKE Amiga 1000 Phoenix GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>Jokes aside, the main goal was to run a graphics card along with <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA500plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA500plus</a> + <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by iComp</p>
<p>On top of tons of other minor hardware mods, He’d also sent me two graphic cards – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/zz9000-for-amiga-preorder" target="_blank">ZZ9000 by MNT</a> and GBAPII++ by KryoFlux.</p>

<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/dg6QzfV.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/dg6QzfV.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Running it</h4>
<p>First things first. Phoenix motherboard is so rare that I first had to learn how it works and how it is all connected etc.</p>
<p>As it gave me a black screen at the very first run, I had to start learning about jumper settings and the board in general</p>
<p>Below, you can see a block diagram of particular parts location to give you an idea of what is where.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1Dz8Jbp.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Of course, I would not move on quickly without MrTrinsics support. He’d pointed me to several sites and sent over some more info about the board itself. One of the most important documents I’ve received was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_jumpers_english.pdf" target="_blank">the jumper settings file</a> along with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://retrohax.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Phoenix.pdf" target="_blank">original manual</a>.</p>
<p>The above documents gave me the general idea of how things should work. The very first thing that I did was the removal of all added mods. I’ve then tried to run the A1K but still no luck – black screen. MrTrinsic then pointed me to jumper L35 which could cause such behavior if set incorrectly and bingo! It worked! </p>
<p>Since Phoenix has slots for more than one ROM chip, it is possible to install three KickStarts – 1.3. and 3.1 and third as a custom option. That was already done, along with a switch hack.</p>

<p>The problem was that Amiga wasn’t starting every single time. Instead, it booted every couple of times. My next move was to take it out and try running it outside of the case. This is where I’ve started noticing all the awesome texts on the PCB itself. I took PCB out started shooting pics of those texts and greetz for various hackers of that era.</p>

<p>Next, I’ve checked for any obvious problems and when I was happy with this inspection, I’ve put it back to a case to simply avoid any accidental short circuits caused by beer-drinking ;P</p>
<p>I’ve decided that I will try to run it with only Indivision ECS2, and KryoFlux GBAPII++ inserted.</p>
<p>I’ve then located the switch setting for the first ROM and put an awesome<a href="http://www.diagrom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DiagROM by John “<em>Chucky</em>” Hertell</a> in a socket. Yeah, I know, it is a quite a large resistor ;P</p>

<p>To my surprise, it worked flawlessly and I was greeted by a known diag info and a menu a bit later.</p>

<p>Once it worked, I’ve figured that it might be as simple as a flaky ROM socket problem. I’ve put a 2.0 ROM in the place of DiagROM and Viola! It works!</p>

<p>When I’ve figured that part out, I could move on and start working on the alternative power supply which was …</p>
<h4>HDPLEX + Uber nice Amiga adapter</h4>
<p>MrTrinsic sent me this HQ HDPLEX Pico PSU but he’d also sent me a very cool DIY KIT – ATX2.0d-Amiga adapter which has super cool features like over-voltage/current protection outputs all needed voltages, and has additional floppy power outputs. Moreover, it generates a TICK signal which is good to have for testing.</p>
<p>However, it was a DIY KIT so I had to solder it all up first.</p>

<p>All I needed to do next was to prepare all the wiring. That was a trivial job after taking some measurements. I’ve used wires from my Nissan Patrol spare wiring kit as these are thick (copper) and nice, hence the color mismatch ;P</p>

<p>It worked like a charm so now I had two working power supplies – original and superior to it HDPLEX with a kickass adapter.</p>
<h4>030 cards</h4>
<p>The next step was about adding 68030 CPU to the system. I had two options as MrTrinsic sent me two different solutions.</p>
<p>The First solution was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/produkt-details/product/ACA500plus.html" target="_blank">ACA500plus</a> card along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/ACA1233n" target="_blank">an ACA1233n</a> accelerator card by Individual Computers. ACA500plus also had an Ethernet add-on – X-Surf 500</p>
<p>These two make a great solution but for AMIGA 500. There are not many folks out there who played it with it in an A1000 and especially with a Phoenix mobo!</p>

<p>Below, a demo running on this setup</p>

<p>The second setup was a bit different. It is made of four devices.</p>
<ul><li>Open 68000 relocator card</li><li>68030 accelerator card </li><li>SDRam + IDE interface</li><li>IDE2CF interface</li></ul>
<p>This setup also appeared to be working nicely after some tests, however as MrTrinsic pointed out, it has some stability issues and will not allow running some software so it was a backup card in case ACA failed. I don’t have a video of it running though.</p>

<h4>Other mods and add-ons</h4>
<p>Once accel-cards were tested, I’ve started installing OS and testing other mods. To name the few:</p>
<ul><li>X-surf 500 Ethernet card</li><li>RapidRoad USB</li><li>Indivision ECS v2</li><li>SCSI2SD </li><li>KryoFlux GBAPII++</li></ul>

<h4>GFX cards</h4>
<p>Once all other major mods were working more or less correctly, I could start testing GFX cards high-res modes.</p>
<p>This is where it all started to go wrong …</p>
<p>I had two cards to test with this setup – GBAPII++ by Kryoflux and ZZ9000 by MNT. </p>
<p>GBAPII++ worked nicely only with green 030 cards, but in such config, there would be no Ethernet card.</p>

<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/RaE0AYH.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/RaE0AYH.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/x5aY8Sy.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/x5aY8Sy.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Then I’ve tried running ZZ9000 along with green 030 and ACA cards but I’ve encountered autoconfig problems.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/olqS18u.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/olqS18u.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/G5sFp80.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/G5sFp80.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/j5tkOVP.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/j5tkOVP.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Finally, I’ve focused on ACA500plus with ACA1233n and I just couldn’t make it work. </p>
<p>When ACA was inserted then GBAPII++ was completely invisible to the system.</p>
<p>After updating tons of libraries, firmware and reinstalling OS a few times without any luck, we’ve figured out that it might be a power issue. MrTrinsic ordered an adapter for A500 which would allow pumping in more power.</p>
<p>I’ve first tested it with a stock A500.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/AFRHzjv.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/AFRHzjv.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/P3Luh0r.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/P3Luh0r.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<p>Same story, GBAPII++ was invisible but I’ve checked it with A1K and power injector adapter just to be sure … unfortunately no luck again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1hkTi44.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/imgur.com/1hkTi44.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>
<h4>Unfinished 🙁</h4>
<p>I’ve invested weeks of time into this GFX problem research but finally, I had to give up on this project for now. It is still in an unfinished state until we will find a solution to all problems. The project is partially done but it requires more work and I hope to cover it someday in one of the future posts making Amiga 1000 Phoenix great again!</p>
<p>But worry not, this gave birth to a new project which is even more awesome.</p>
<p>Currently, it is a work-in-progress but that is a story for another blog post 🙂</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2Ftelemelt-FINAL.png?v=1601250432872" alt="Telemelt Logo"></p>
<p><a href="https://telemelt.com/">Telemelt</a> is a web-based multi-emulator (<a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>/<a href="https://www.libretro.com/">libretro</a>) designed to recreate the experience of playing console games with a single controller in a room full of friends.</p>
<p>Gathering around a TV and collectively attempting to beat a game has been a consistent joy throughout my life, and is one of the rituals I miss the most with the ones we're separated from right now. I wanted to create a way to play single player/hotseat games with friends remotely that was free and required minimal setup. Netplay has always been unsatisfying for this, since only the host had low enough latency for games that require tight timing. I started this project in March, and have been pouring my heart into it every day possible since then.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/33ee6b19-10fa-4d51-8898-d35eb670b3fe%2F6dfcbe63-2f80-4bb3-a780-a48a51dc0a19.image.png?v=1602011998888" alt="collage"></p>
<p>The system skips traditional netplay to allow a single player to assume host responsibility and experience <strong>zero network latency</strong> for games with demanding response times, with the viewers processing frames as broadcasted by the player. The virtual controller/host can be instantly passed to any user in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Designed to be lowest hassle way to play emulated games with a friend or loved one, even if they are not tech savvy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No port forwarding, no IP addresses thanks to auto-generated URL</li>
<li>No installation or downloads, everything works in browser</li>
<li>Mappings for common/inexpensive controllers (PS3/4, XB360/1, Switch JC/Pro etc..) on both USB/BT thanks to RetroArch bindings</li>
<li>Always free! No tracking, no logins, no paid advertisements - personal budget allocated for Azure costs to serve thousands of users for months</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus on the experience of passing <em>a single controller</em> between people</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for a unique and efficient architecture that provides a consistent experience with minimal bandwidth</li>
<li>No AV is transmitted! Only controller and serialized state data, made even smaller by <a href="https://github.com/phretaddin/schemapack">schemapack</a></li>
<li>User state error checked per frame and reconciled via <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> server if needed</li>
<li>Takes advantage of deterministic nature of certain libretro cores - like a broadcasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool-assisted_speedrun">TAS</a></li>
<li>Rethink the kinds of content you would play (painting, music collaboration, RPGs, game shows)</li>
<li>Everyone working towards the same goal keeps people engaged</li>
</ul>

<strong>Quick start - Open up a Discord/Zoom/Meet etc.. with friends and try some of these!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minigame collections (player transfer system is fast enough to keep up with switching on every stage)</li>
<li>Practice for a week then hold live olympic games (world/winter/summer/california games etc)</li>
<li>Live sound test or NSF/VGM listening party</li>
<li>Homebrews, hacks, and live demoparties (with live reactions)</li>
<li>Golf / bowling / fishing games to chill</li>
<li>Create music collaboratively in LSDJ/NTRQ</li>
<li>TV Gameshows</li>
<li>Painting games (mouse support!)<br>

<li>Grind through an rpg over a few weeks (savestates work great for this!)</li>
<li>Alternate copiloting an game no one has played before on gamefaqs</li>
<li>Hotseat tactical / turn based games</li>
<li>Teach a friend to speedrun with the ability to demonstrate and practice together</li>
</ul>
