<p>Software engineers have long joked about how much of their job is <a href="https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/">simply Googling things</a>.</p>
<p>Now you can do the same, but for free.</p>
<p>Below, I'll cover <code>dorking</code>, the use of search engines to find very specific data:</p>
<p>For each example, you can paste it directly into Google to see the result.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/Contextify1/status/1255202725551202304">this Twitter exchange</a> with Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia, the next few examples will cover Gumroad and Sahil.</p>
<p>find specific pages within a website (ex: for DynamoDB e-books)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com dynamodb
</pre></div>


<p>find specific pages that must include a phrase in the Title text</p>
<div><pre><span></span>allintitle:"support this" site:gumroad.com
</pre></div>


<p>find similar sites (Google only)</p>



<p>you can chain operators together (ex: looking for bug bounties with either security or bug-bounty in the URL)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>(inurl:security OR inurl:bug-bounty OR site:hackerone.com) + "gumroad"
</pre></div>


<p>you can restrict to certain top-level domains (ex: lists of teachers)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:.edu filetype:xls inurl:"email.xls"
</pre></div>



<h3 id="emails">emails</h3>

<p>find Gmail accounts</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gmail.com"
</pre></div>


<p>find work accounts (you'll need to find their domain first)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>sahil lavingia "@gumroad.com"
</pre></div>


<p>not finding what you're looking for with either of those? Try to guess the  format of the email (try going to <a href="https://www.email-format.com/d/shopify.com/#">this site</a>, search the domain, and click <code>Identified Name Formats</code>))</p>



<p>you can always find every page with emails on it (and then use the next snippet below)</p>
<div><pre><span></span>site:gumroad.com intext:"@gumroad.com"

<p>cybersecurity experts use dorking, as one tool among many, to find potential vulnerabilities in a company. I will not be covering any such queries, out of concern for their potential for misuse.</p>

<h3 id="review">operator review</h3>

<p><code>operators</code> are components of a search query that narrow the results down. You can combine as many as you want in one query. The most useful ones you'll want to know are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>operator</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"phrase"</td>
<td>results must include "phrase"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-phrase</td>
<td>exclude results with phrase</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 AND phrase2 &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>phrase1 and phrase2 must both be included</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>phrase1 OR phrase2</td>
<td>one of phrase1 and phrase2 must be included (or both)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>site:example.com</td>
<td>results must be on domain example.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>filetype:jpg</td>
<td>results must be of type <code>.jpg</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>AND/OR logic can be used to combine distinct queries</p>
<div><pre><span></span>"phrase1" OR "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"
# equivalent to these two searches
&gt;&gt; "phrase1"
&gt;&gt; "phrase 2" AND "phrase3"

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Despite using a FTTH internet connection since 2014, aside from the one fiber
uplink, I had always used network gear with 1 Gbit/s links over regular old rj45
cat5(e) cables.</p>

<hr>

<p>I liked the simplicity and uniformity of that setup, but decided it’s time to
add at least one fiber connection, to <strong>get rid of a temporary ethernet cable</strong>
that connected my kitchen with the rest of my network that is largely in the
living room and office.</p>

<p>The temporary ethernet cable was an experiment to verify that running a server
or two in my kitchen actually works (it does!). I used a <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/hama-cat-6-flach-we-1000cm-netzwerkkabel-7465292">flat ethernet
cable</a>,
which is great for test setups like that, as you can often tape it onto the
walls and still close the doors.</p>

<p>So, we will replace one ethernet cable with one fiber cable and converters at
each end:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-media-converters.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="216" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p>Why is it good to switch from copper ethernet cables to fiber in this case?
Fiber cables are <strong>smaller and hence easier to fit</strong> into existing cable
ducts. While regular ethernet cable is way too thick to fit into any of the
existing ducts in my flat, I was hoping that fiber might fit!</p>

<p>When I actually received the cables, I was surprised <strong>how much thinner</strong> fiber
cables actually can be: there are 0.9mm cables, which are so thin, they can be
hidden in plain sight! I had only ever seen 2mm fiber cables before, and the
0.9mm cables are incredibly light, flexible and thin! Even pasta is typically
thicker:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-glasnudeln.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="0.9mm thin fiber cables"></a></p>

<p><small><em>Preparing a delicious pot of glass noodles ;)</em></small></p>

<hr>

<p>The cable shown above comes from <a href="https://www.fs.com/company/about_us.html">the fiber store
FS.COM</a>, which different people have
praised on multiple occasions, so naturally I was curious to give them a shot
myself.</p>

<p>Also, for the longest time, it was my understanding that fiber connectors can
only be put onto fiber cables using expensive (≫2000 CHF) machines. A while ago
I heard about <strong>field assembly connectors</strong> so I wanted to verify that those
indeed work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aside from practical reasons, playing around with fiber networking also makes
for a good hobby during a pandemic :)</p>

<h2 id="hardware-selection">Hardware Selection</h2>

<p>I ordered all my fiber equipment at <a href="https://www.fs.com/">FS.COM</a>: everything
they have is very affordable, and products in stock at their German warehouse
arrive in Switzerland (and presumably other European countries) within the same
week.</p>

<p>If you are in the luxurious position to have enough physical space and agility
to pull through an entire fiber cable, <strong>without having to remove any
connectors</strong>, you can make a new network connection with just a few parts:</p>

<p>I recommend buying an extra fiber cable or two so that you can accidentally
damage a cable and still have enough spares.</p>

<p>Total cost thus far: just under 100 CHF. If you have existing switches with a
free SFP slot, you can use those instead of the media converters and save most
of the cost.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you need to <strong>temporarily remove</strong> one or both of the fiber cable connector(s),
you also need field assembly connectors and a few tools in addition:</p>

<p>I recommend buying twice the number of field assembly connectors, for practicing.</p>

<p>Personally, I screwed up two connectors before figuring out <a href="#field-assembly-connectors">how the process
goes</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost: about 160 CHF for the field assembly equipment, so 260 CHF in total.</p>

<hr>

<p>To boost your confidence in the resulting fiber, the following items are nice to
have, but you can get by without, if you’re on a budget.</p>

</table>

<p>With the visual fault locator, you can shine a light through your fiber. You can
verify correct connector assembly by looking at how the light comes out of the
connector.</p>

<p>The fiber cleaning swabs are good to have in general, but for the field assembly
connector, you need to use alcohol-soaked wipes anyway (which FS.COM does not
stock).</p>

<p>The total cost for everything is just under 300 CHF.</p>

<h3 id="hardware-selection-process">Hardware Selection Process</h3>

<p>The large selection at FS.COM can be overwhelming to navigate at first. My
selection process went something like this:</p>

<p>My first constraint is using bi-directional (BiDi) fiber optics modules so that
I only need to lay a single fiber cable, as opposed to two fiber cables.</p>

<p>The second constraint is to use field assembly connectors.</p>

<p>If possible, I wanted to use <a href="https://community.fs.com/blog/why-not-use-bend-insensitive-fiber-optic-cable-to-reduce-bend-radius.html">bend-insensitive
fiber</a>
so that I wouldn’t need to pay so much attention to the bend radius and have
more flexibility in where and how I can lay fiber.</p>

<p>With these constraints, there aren’t too many products left to combine. An
obvious and good choice are 0.9mm fiber cable using LC/UPC connectors.</p>

<h3 id="fs-com-details">FS.COM details</h3>

<p>As of 2020-08-05, FS.COM states they have 5 warehouses in 4 locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delaware (US)</li>
<li>Munich (Germany)</li>
<li>Melbourne (Australia)</li>
<li>Shenzhen (China)</li>
</ul>

<p>They recently built another, bigger (7 km²) warehouse in Shenzhen, and now
produce inventory for the whole year.</p>

<p>By 2019, FS.COM had over 300,000 registered corporate customers, reaching nearly
200 million USD yearly sales.</p>

<h2 id="delivery-times">Delivery times</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, delivery times are quick when the products are in stock at
FS.COM’s German warehouse.</p>

<p>In my case, I put in my order on 2020-Jun-26.</p>

<p>The items that shipped from the German warehouse arrived on 2020-Jul-01.</p>

<p>Some items had to be manufactured and/or shipped from Asia. Those items arrived
after 3 more weeks, on 2020-Jul-24.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, FS.COM doesn’t stock any 0.9mm fiber cables in their German
warehouse right now, so be prepared for a few weeks of waiting time.</p>

<h2 id="laying-the-fiber">Laying The Fiber</h2>

<p>Use a cable puller to pull the fiber through existing cable ducts where
possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In general, buy the thinnest one you can find. I have <a href="https://www.distrelec.ch/en/cable-pull-strap-10m-tools-495005/p/18092626">this 4mm diameter cable
puller</a>,
but a 3mm or even 2mm one would work in more situations.</p></li>

<li><p>I found it worthwhile to buy a brand one. It is distinctly better to handle
(less stiff, i.e. more flexible) than the cheap one I got, and thinner, too,
which is always good.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience, it generally did not work well to <strong>push</strong> the fiber into an
existing duct or alongside an existing cable. I really needed a cable
<strong>puller</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky and have enough space in your duct(s), you can leave the
existing connectors on the fiber. I have successfully just used a piece of tape
to fix the fiber connector on the cable puller, pushing down the nose
temporarily:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-cable-puller.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable taped to cable puller"></a></p>

<p>Where there are no existing ducts, you may need to lay the fiber on top of the
wall. Obviously, this is tricky as soon as you need to make a connection going
through a wall: whereas copper ethernet cables can be bent and squeezed into
door frames, you quickly risk breaking fiber cables.</p>

<p>Luckily, the fiber is very light, so it’s very easy to fix to the wall with a
piece of tape:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-wand-kabel.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cables on the wall"></a></p>

<p>You can see the upstream internet fiber in the top right corner, which is rather
thick in comparison to my 0.9mm yellow fiber that’s barely visible in the middle
of the picture.</p>

<p>Note how the fiber entirely disappears behind the existing duct atop the
door!</p>

<p>Above, you can see the flat ethernet cable I have been using as a temporary
experiment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Where there is an existing cable that you can temporarily remove, it might be
possible to remove it, put the fiber in, and put the old cable back in,
too. This is possible because the 0.9mm fiber cable is so thin!</p>

<p>I’m using this technique to cross another wall where the existing cable duct is
too full, but there is a cable that can be removed and put back after pulling
the fiber through:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-loch.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing cable"></a></p>

<p>…and on the other side of the wall:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-04-dose.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>Note how the fiber is thin enough to fit between the socket and duct!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> despite measuring how long a fiber cable I would need, my cable turned
out too short! While the cable was just as long as I had measured, with
distances exceeding 10m, it is a good idea to <strong>add a few meters spare</strong> on each
side of the connection.</p>

<h2 id="field-assembly-connectors">Field assembly connectors</h2>

<p>To give you an overview, these are the required steps at a high level:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14346.html">Fibre Optic Kevlar Cutter</a></li>
<li>Strip the fiber with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/72812.html">Fibre Optical Stripper</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>jacket</em> onto the fiber</li>
<li>Cut the stripped fiber cleanly with the <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/14341.html">High Precision Fibre Optic Cleaver FS-08C</a></li>
<li>Put the field assembly <em>connector</em> onto the fiber</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I thought the following resources were useful:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pictograms: <a href="https://img-en.fs.com/file/user_manual/lc-field-assembly-connector-quick-start-guide-v1.0.pdf">PDF: FS.COM LC UPC field assembley connectors quick start
guide</a></li>
<li>Pictures: <a href="https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/35165.html">Installation Procedure on
FS.COM</a></li>
<li>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epTzemeJjAw">YouTube: Terminate Fiber in 5
Minutes</a>: this video shows a
different product, but I found it helpful to see any field assembly connector
on video, and this is one of the better videos I could find.</li>
</ol>

<!-- TODO: include a link to my own video once published -->

<hr>

<p><strong>Beware:</strong> the little paper booklet that comes with the field assembly
connector contains measurements which are <strong>not to scale</strong>. I have suggested to
FS.COM that they fix this, but until then, you’ll need to use e.g. a tape
measure.</p>

<hr>

<p>For establishing an intuition of their different sizes, here are the different connectors:</p>

<p><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.jpg"><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.1x.jpg" srcset="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.2x.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/Bilder/2020-08-07-fiber-cable-connector-size.thumb.3x.jpg 3x" width="600" height="450" alt="fiber cable next to existing socket"></a></p>

<p>From left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0mm fiber cable</li>
<li>cat6 ethernet cable</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC factory)</li>
<li>0.9mm fiber cable (LC/UPC field assembly connector)</li>
</ul>

<p>The 0.9mm fiber cables come with smaller connectors than the 2.0mm fiber cables,
and that alone might be a reason to prefer them in some situations.</p>

<p>The field assembly connectors are pretty bulky in comparison, but since you can
attach them yourself after pulling only the cable through the walls and/or
ducts, you usually don’t care too …</p></div></div>

August 9, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/how-i-got-my-japanese-pr.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018 I applied for and received Permanent Residency in Japan. The process I
used is relatively new and unknown so I wanted to document it in case it might
come in handy for someone else.</p>
<h2 id="my-background"> My Background</h2>
<p>In 2011 I graduated with a Master's degree from Brown University and then moved
to Japan and got a job as a software engineer. I am not married. I am fluent in
Japanese but would not be mistaken for a native speaker. I am a citizen of the
United States.</p>
<h2 id="highly-skilled-foreign-professional"> Highly Skilled Foreign Professional</h2>
<p>There are three main ways to qualify for Permanent Residency in Japan.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can be a resident for 10 years or more on a work visa, or a smaller number of years on a marriage visa.</li>
<li>You can make a significant contribution to Japan (<a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/nyuukokukanri/kouhou/nyukan_nyukan36.html">我が国への貢献</a>), such as personally contributing to an Olympic victory by coaching, winning a similarly prestigious prize, or getting a medal from the Emperor.</li>
<li>You can use the Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Highly Skilled Foreign Professional visa is a points-based visa system
introduced in 2012. It seems to have been modeled on points-based visa systems
introduced in Australia. The basic idea is that based on things like income,
educational history, and language ability you get points, and if you have
enough points you can apply for a special visa. In 2017, on average 352 people
a month were accepted in the visa program. (see graph 1-3-3 on page 27
<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000627735.pdf">here</a>)</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the HSFP visa is a fast track to Permanent Residency.
When it was first introduced you could apply for a PR after five years on the
HSFP visa, as opposed to ten years on a normal work visa. Over time the fast
track became even faster, and in 2018 you could apply after three years or even
just one year if you had enough points. What changed in 2017 was that if you
could demonstrate that you had the points historically you could apply for a PR
without ever having the HSFP visa. That's the process I used.</p>
<h2 id="the-points"> The Points</h2>
<p>The way points calculation works is you calculate your points at the start of
the term (so one or three years ago) and at the time of your application for a
PR, and submit a separate point sheet for each of those times.</p>
<p>There are three categories of HSFP visa: academic, specialist/technical, and
business management. I was in the specialist/technical category, which covers
more than 80% of applicants. Some point sources are shared between all three
categories, but they do have significant differences in where most points come
from. For example, if you apply with the academic category, published papers
become an important criteria for points.</p>
<p>Excluding salary, here's my point breakdown. Note that this uses the rules at
the time of my application in 2018, and they have changed slightly since then,
and are likely to continue to change over time. You can view the current points
sheet as an Excel file at the <a href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/newimmiact_3/en/evaluate/index.html">Immigration Bureau site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Master's Degree: 20 points</li>
<li>5-7 years of work experience: 10 points</li>
<li>Age less than 30: 15 points</li>
<li>JLPT N1: 15 points</li>
<li>Highly ranked school bonus: 10 points</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a total of 70 points at the time of my application (again, excluding
salary). 70 points is already enough to qualify for the three-year fast track.
A year before my application I only had the JLPT N2 (10 points) for a slightly
lower total of 65. That means that with a salary of five million yen a year or
more (roughly 50,000USD, worth 15 points) I would be eligible for the one-year
fast track.</p>
<p>There are a number of other bonuses I didn't qualify for, or may have qualified
for but didn't investigate because I already had enough points. When the system
was introduced it was relatively hard to get enough points to qualify, but over
time it's gotten easier. For example, initially only the JLPT N1 was worth
points, but later the N2 was added as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-reason-letter"> The Reason Letter</h2>
<p>Most of the paperwork required for the PR application is unremarkable. One
major exception is the 理由書 or "reason letter". The reason letter is required
when applying for a PR from a work visa, but the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/ZAIRYU_EIJYU/zairyu_eijyu03.html#content:~:text=%E6%B0%B8%E4%BD%8F%E8%A8%B1%E5%8F%AF%E3%82%92%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E3%81%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E7%90%86%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%EF%BC%8C%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E3%81%AA%E5%BD%A2%E5%BC%8F%E3%81%A7%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%80%82">only guidance</a> is
that there is no fixed format. What on earth are you supposed to write in it?</p>
<p>By looking at websites run by immigration lawyers and blog posts from various
people, it seems the conventional wisdom is that you should briefly state your
educational history and how you came to Japan. You also need to explain your
reason for seeking the PR, but "I want to keep living in Japan" is not
appropriate.</p>
<p>Typical reasons to use here are an intention to raise a family or needing a PR
in order to get a loan. (Anyone can own property in Japan, but it's difficult
to get a mortgage if you don't have a PR.) Neither of those applied to me so I
struggled with what to put in the letter. Eventually I settled on describing
several reasons I was invested in staying in Japan, with supporting documentation.</p>
<p>Besides discussing my day job, one point was my work on Japanese NLP projects.
At the time of my application I was working on adding Japanese support to
<a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, and as part of implementing Universal Dependencies I needed to
contact <a href="https://www.ninjal.ac.jp/">NINJAL</a>, who were incredibly kind in responding to a request from a
random Internet person. I described this as part of an ongoing personal effort
to make Japanese NLP easier, which continues now that I maintain a
popular <a href="https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3">Python tokenizer for Japanese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/polm">other projects</a>.</p>
<p>Another point was my work with <a href="https://www.tokyoindies.com/">Tokyo Indies</a>, the largest monthly game
development gathering in Tokyo, where I'm on staff. Tokyo Indies had media
coverage from a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/matome/f2books/indies01.html">Famitsu subsidiary</a> and the <a href="https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/mv/wbs/archive?date=2017-10-03">WBS television program</a>,
which made good supporting documents showing both the importance of the event
and my involvement in it.</p>
<p>A third point, different from the first two, was using the reason letter to
explain issues with my other supporting documentation. One of the required
documents for a PR application is a bank statement showing financial
independence in the form of savings or steady income. A few months before my PR
application I broke my leg, and I was unable to walk without crutches for three
months, two of which I was on unpaid leave. The reason letter gave me a place
to explain the situation (and attach X-rays).</p>
<h2 id="the-application-and-the-wait"> The Application and the Wait</h2>
<p>I actually composed my PR application during the considerable downtime I had
after breaking my leg, and went to Immigration on crutches towards the end of
my recovery process. When handing over my documents the person at the counter
was impressed by their tidyness, though all I'd done was use the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ONLINE/IMMIGRATION/16-4.html#content:~:text=%E7%94%B3%E8%AB%8B%E6%9B%B8%E6%A7%98%E5%BC%8F">officially
provided Excel template</a> to fill it out.</p>
<p>One thing I was told at the counter was that I could provide a copy of my N2
certificate instead of the original. Official instructions say all supporting
documents generally have to be original, but I was told it was OK to copy my
US-issued N2 cert because it was hard to get it replaced. (Looking at <a href="https://www.aatj.org/jlpt-old-scores">current
re-issuance instructions</a> it doesn't look that bad, perhaps the
process has changed since my application.)</p>
<p>I also asked about whether I needed to submit a copy of my degree. I assumed I
didn't since I'd submitted one with my initial visa application years before
and figured it was still on file. I was told it was probably fine without it.
(It wasn't, but I'll get to that later.)</p>
<p>I applied in late January 2018 and was told that it would take a year to
process my application. This was a bit of a surprise, as Immigration's site
said it usually takes 4-6 months. Apparently the recent change in requirements
for PR applications had increased both the number of applicants and the amount
of time required per application as Immigration got used to the new rules.</p>
<p>In late September I got a letter from Immigration about an issue with my
documents. It turned out they needed a copy of my degree, submitted by mail
within two weeks. I had not expected this and it was nearly a problem - my
degrees were at my parents' house in America, and they don't use the Internet,
let alone a scanner. It took a nervous few days but my brother who lives nearby
managed to get the degrees and send me scans of them.</p>
<p>That presented another problem - I had forgotten, but my degree was in Latin.
All documents submitted as part of an application have to be translated into
Japanese, and I don't speak Latin. (Maybe they wouldn't really care about a
degree, but I didn't want to take any chances.) Luckily Brown has <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/http%3A/www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-records/replacement-diplomas/english-tra">an English
translation</a> of their degrees, but that presented another problem - the
text of the degree reads like magical language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO ALL WHO ARE ABOUT TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, EVERLASTING GREETINGS IN THE LORD.</p>
<p>BE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE AUTHORITY
ENTRUSTED TO HER/HIM BY THE BOARD OF FELLOWS HAS BESTOWED IN PUBLIC ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>AND TO HIM/HER HAS GIVEN TO ENJOY ALL THE PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS AND HONORS AND
SYMBOLS PERTAINING TO THOSE ADVANCED TO THIS DEGREE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ended up writing a sheet explaining the degree was mostly formulaic language
including "appeals to God etc." and just translating the gist of it as "A
Degree in X is bestowed on Y". On the copy of the degree I circled the
important parts ("SCIENTIA COMPUTATORIA" is "Computer Science") and translated
them. I mailed the degree in time.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c059ca6e/walkhome.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/c059ca6e/img/walkhome.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>A picture taken walking home after going by the ward office that day.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In late November the small postcard that implies acceptance came, and I took a
day off to go and get my new Residence Card. The process was short and
unremarkable. Since I had spare time and no plans I ended up going by my ward
office to update my My Number Card, deeply confusing the staff with a freshly
issued card not yet reflected in some databases and an unusual procedure, but
that got sorted too. (I did end up having to fill out a Change of Address form
with no Change of Address, but such is paperwork.)</p>
<p>In total it took ten months from application to acceptance, which while long
was less than the year I was quoted. Looking at posts by immigration lawyers
online it looks like the fastest applications around this time took eight
months. I …</p></div></div>

			<h2>–ise or –ize?</h2>
			

                    <p>There is nothing like a good rant!&nbsp; It may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">improve </span>the world, and it may not 
					<span lang="en-gb">fix the issue that initiated the </span>rant, but it feels so <em>good </em>afterwards.</p>

                    <p>This rant is about the suggestion that the use of a
                    ‘z’ in words like nationalization is somehow
                    wrong, or American. It must be admitted that there are
                    words with a ‘z’ in them that are purely
                    American, like advertize, or maybe just wrong, like
                    surmize. Sometimes it is simply error — a word whose
                    spelling is not known, and whose correct spelling is not
                    sought, is arbitrarily given a ‘z’ in the
                    honest but mistaken belief it is correct. Sometimes words
                    with a z-form in American represent an older (perhaps
                    Elizabethan) form of English that made its way to the USA
                    before the language was standardized in England. More
                    likely, the American ‘z’ is one of Noah
                    Webster’s attempts to ‘standardize’ or
                    ‘improve’ American usage of English when he
                    produced his famous dictionary in 1828, in which his
                    decision to make deliberate and extensive revisions of
                    spelling was implemented — he has been described as a great
                    spelling reformer (I also had a go at reforming spelling
                    when I was at school but it wasn’t appreciated).
                    Webster evidently decided to use a ‘z’ wherever
                    he considered the pronunciation called for it. This was a 
					highly unusual example of a dictionary leading the written 
					language rather than attempting to reflect it.</p>

                    <p>This polemic is nothing to do with the Americans. If we
                    overlook the various words that the Americans deliberately
                    choose to spell differently, the majority of words that take a
                    ‘z’, or an ‘s’ that is pronounced
                    like a ‘z’, seem to fall very clearly into
                    those that must take an ‘s’ (like
                    <em>compromise</em>, where the derivation is
                    –misser), those that must take a ‘z’,
                    (like <em>prize</em>), and the rest, about which
                    controversy apparently rages (if only here).</p>

                    <p>I have been to a great deal of trouble to look into
                    this, looking not only at various text books and style manuals,
                    but also at a range of literature over the years to see
                    which spelling was preferred. I refer only to cases of the 
					third type given above where writers <span lang="en-gb">or 
					their publishers </span>have come to regard the 
					use of 's' as an acceptable alternative to the 'z' (we are 
					all agreed that misuse of the two other types would be an 
					error).</p>

                    <p>It seems to me that in books printed in England the use
                    of the ‘z’ overwhelmingly predominated until
                    the Second World War, though on a far smaller scale the
                    ‘s’ can be found used by some printing houses,
                    even in Victorian times. Textbooks set out the correctness
                    of using ‘z’, some of them setting out in
                    considerable detail the rationale for use of
                    ‘s’ or ‘z’ depending on origin.
                    After the Second World War the ‘s’ alternative
                    is more frequently offered as a possibility and some house
                    style manuals (though not Oxford’s) indicate a
                    preference for ‘s’ — not because of any
                    suggestion that ‘z’ is wrong, mark you, but
                    because ‘s’ had come to be tolerated and it avoided
                    having to remember which usage is which. Recent manuals and
                    dictionaries seem to have given up on the prescriptive use
                    of a ‘z’, though it is usually offered as an
                    alternative where correct.</p>

                    <p>It seems to me, summarizing, and using a ‘z’
                    correctly and non-Americanly, that:</p>
					

                    <p>For myself, I am very happy to keep using a
                    ‘z’ where it is appropriate, and I do try hard
                    to get it right but must admit to being inconsistent
                    sometimes. <span lang="en-gb">Using the ‘z’ form</span>, of course, invites people to pick me up on
                    it, whence I refer them to the Oxford English Dictionary
                    (the big one) and that generally ends the matter. On the 
					whole it is not a book to pick a fight with.</p>

                    <p>I suppose even after being presented with the facts
                    there will be people who will persist with the
                    ‘s’ option, and that’s up to them —
                    nothing more I can do. All I ask is that people determined
                    to use the ‘s’ do not regard those using the
                    ‘z’ as using Americanisms!!!</p>

                    <p>Many of the great publishing houses are happy with ‘
                    <em>-ize</em>’ etc endings, and large, influential
                    organizations such as London Transport invariably used the
                    ‘- <em>ize’ </em>form in posters and other public
                    communications, though their modern PC-originated material
                    leaves much to be desired.</p>

                    <p>I attach below <span lang="en-gb">(actually it is in the 
					next column) </span>various references that shed more light
                    on the matter. Note that some house style guidance which
                    has opted for the '- <em>ise</em>' form refers to
                    alleged controversy about the more correct spelling about
                    which 'the authorities differ'. House style guides
                    are not authorities of themselves, although they may rely
                    on them and refer to them. Of the ‘authorities’ I
                    have sought, they all indicate '- <em>ize</em>' as

                    <p>THE <em>-ize, not -ise,</em> ending
                    should be used where both spellings are in use. Generally,
                    <em>-ize</em> is a suffix applied to the stems of nouns

                    complete noun.</p>

                    transistor&nbsp;− transistorize</p>

                    <p>The ending -ise is correct when the
                    noun has <em>–is ­</em>as part of the stem, e.g.
                    in the syllables <em>-vis­</em> (seeing), -cis-
                    (cutting), <em>-mis-</em> (putting), and is also used for
                    those nouns which do not terminate in <em>-ism,
                    -ization,</em> etc. Exceptions are

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orge37fcf2">
<p> The C++ standard does not specify how virtual functions should be implemented. In practice, however, compilers generate a virtual function table and place a pointer to it as the first member of a class. Multiple inheritance complicates things, but let’s not jump into that rabbit hole for now. Instead, consider the following C++ class: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>class</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>virtual</span> ~<span>A</span>();
  <span>virtual</span> <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>);
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Since the structure of the virtual function table is not standardized, compilers may use different layouts. The layout used by the GCC compiler is this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>A_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>; <span>// </span><span>Pointer to type information</span>
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>A</span>*); <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);    <span>// </span><span>Function pointer</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Virtual function pointers are laid out in declaration order. The <code>A_vtable</code> structure reveals another C++ secret: member functions are just obfuscated versions of normal functions that get <code>this</code> as the first argument. That’s it. If you know Python, D or Nim, this won’t surprise you a bit. </p>
<p> The fact that C++ has a dedicated syntax for member functions leads to numerous problems which I’m not going to detail here. Fixes have been proposed since at least 2004, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericniebler/status/705855444049399808">to no avail</a>. The <code>std::function</code> class however had to do it the right way, so we ended up with a language that has one syntax as a language feature and another as a standard library feature. </p>
<p> OK, enough whining. Back to our original track. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler actually generates</span>
<span>int</span> <span>A_func</span>(<span>A</span>* <span>this</span>, <span>int</span> <span>param</span>)
{
  <span>return</span> param;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p> Generated member function names are actually much more complicated due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling#C++">name mangling</a>. </p>
<p> There is one virtual table that is shared by all instances of <code>class A</code>, and the compiler will statically initialize it for you by placing the addresses of <code>A</code>‘s member functions and the generated type info into it. About like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>const</span> <span>A_vtable</span> <span>A_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;A_type_info,  <span>// </span><span>We'll skip this now</span>
  &amp;A_destructor, <span>// </span><span>Pointer to an ordinary function</span>
  &amp;A_func        <span>// </span><span>Ditto</span>
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Now, whenever you create an instance of <code>class A</code>, you actually instantiate a structure like this: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>struct</span> <span>class_A</span>
{
  <span>A_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> The compiler will initialize the <code>vtable</code> pointer for you. </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You write</span>
<span>A</span> <span>a</span>;

<span>// </span><span>What actually happens</span>
<span>class_A</span> <span>a</span>;
a.vtable = &amp;A_vtable_instance;
</pre>
</div>
<p> If you derive <code>B</code> from <code>A</code>, this is what happens (conceptually): </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>class</span> <span>B</span> : <span>public</span> <span>A</span>
{
<span>public</span>:
  <span>int</span> <span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) <span>override</span>;
  <span>virtual</span> <span>void</span> <span>func2</span>() <span>const</span>; <span>// </span><span>A new virtual function</span>
};

<span>int</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func</span>(<span>int</span>) {}

<span>void</span> <span>B</span>::<span>func2</span>() <span>const</span> {}

<span>// </span><span>The compiler generates</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>B_vtable</span>
{
  <span>void</span>* <span>type_info</span>;
  <span>void</span> (*<span>destructor</span>)(<span>B</span>*);
  <span>int</span> (*<span>func</span>)(<span>A</span>*,<span>int</span>);
  <span>void</span> (*<span>func2</span>)(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*);
};

<span>// </span><span>Auto-generated default destructor.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_destructor</span>(<span>B</span>* <span>b</span>)
{
  A_destructor((<span>A</span>*)b);
}

<span>int</span> <span>B_func</span>(<span>B</span>*, <span>int</span>) {}

<span>// </span><span>Member function qualifiers are actually qualifiers</span>
<span>// </span><span>of the this pointer.</span>
<span>void</span> <span>B_func2</span>(<span>const</span> <span>B</span>*) {}

<span>// </span><span>Note that the first three members have the same</span>
<span>// </span><span>layout as A_vtable, which means we can safely access</span>
<span>// </span><span>a B_vtable pointer as an A_vtable pointer.</span>
<span>const</span> <span>B_vtable</span> <span>B_vtable_instance</span>
{
  &amp;B_type_info,
  &amp;B_destructor,
  &amp;B_func,
  &amp;B_func2
};

<span>struct</span> <span>class_B</span>
{
  <span>B_vtable</span>* <span>vtable</span>;
  <span>int</span> <span>member</span>;
};
</pre>
</div>
<p> Whenever your code calls a virtual function in <code>A</code>, the compiler looks up the actual function to call through the virtual function table: </p>
<div>

<pre id="nil"><span>// </span><span>You say</span>
<span>B</span> <span>b</span>;
<span>A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;func(1);

<span>// </span><span>You get</span>
<span>class_B</span> <span>b</span>;
b.vtable = &amp;B_vtable_instance;
<span>class_A</span>* <span>a</span> = &amp;b;
a-&gt;vtable-&gt;func(a, 1);
</pre>
</div>
</div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
  This is a demo of compiling and running <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> assembly in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  Press the button to see it compile and run a tiny "hello world" program. You can also try modifying the LLVM assembly and pressing the button again - note though that <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM assembly</a> is typed, so if you add characters to the string for example, you will need to adjust its length, both where it is defined and where it is used (otherwise you will get errors, which will show up in the output area).
</p>



<hr>

<br>

<br>





<hr>
<p>
  This demo works by using parts of the LLVM toolchain (llvm-dis and llvm-as), compiled by <a href="http://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> from C++ to JavaScript, to check the assembly for errors and pretty-print it. Then the emscripten compiler (originally written in JavaScript, but ported from the normal batch/shell mode to the browser environment) is run on the output, and the code executed directly.
</p>
<p>
  This demo was done as a fun hacking project over a holiday vacation, so there are some caveats: The generated code is not optimized at all, so benchmarking is pointless; if you want to benchmark, run emscripten normally with <code>-O2</code>. Compilation speed has also not been optimized at all. Also, this demo has hardly been tested and glues together several codebases in ways they were not originally intended, there might be things that do not work.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>There is a number of online “alternative lifestyle” movements that have been gaining steam among millennials. They are appealing in their leanness: do more with less. At first, they seem cute and liberating. Scores of Instagram influencers and bloggers romanticize these lifestyles, and their subreddits are buzzing with zealots. Key examples below:</p> <p><strong>FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</strong>: live frugally now to save money as quickly as possible, then buy a place in a low cost-of-living area and live (mostly) off your savings.</p> <p><strong>Van Life</strong>: Buy a van, trick it out with a beautiful bed and a kitchen. Live lightly, travel the world, work remotely.</p> <p><strong>Tiny Houses</strong>: Nobody needs 5,000 square feet. Why not play with constraints, and build a full house with the square feet of a studio?</p> <p><strong>Remote Work</strong>: work your high-paying-job from a low-cost-of-living area, save up money, and save on commuting.</p> <p>While these lifestyles are marketed as all about freedom, they come with major restrictions: they are overwhelmingly for the single and childless. Having children is very expensive, so it’s hard to make that work with FIRE. On the other hand, van life and tiny houses are logistically prohibitive to having children. By going down these routes, their adherents will delay having kids, likely by years. That’s usually a bad trade.</p> <p>Not only do these lifestyles constrain, they also reflect a severe already-existing capital constraint. Broadly, <em>all</em> of these movements are reactions to poverty. Living in a van, tiny house, or remotely all stem from one factor: real estate in your preferred area (perhaps the place you call “home”) is too expensive. You can’t afford to buy or rent a real place there, so you move into an Instagrammable shed, or you move away altogether. These lifestyles are solutions to problems of poverty – but in making those solutions fashionable, they hide the ugly reality underneath.</p> <p>Ultimately, these movements romanticize and hide the true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials#In_the_United_States">generational poverty of millennials</a>. This is a generation of people who will never retire, who may never even buy real estate of their own. In terms of intergenerational wealth, these people are screwed. And I would like to see that point raised and addressed, instead of making do with solutions of desperation.</p> <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<h2>ImageMagick Examples - Introductory Notes</h2>

<h3>What is ImageMagick?  A No-Holds-Barred Summary</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> is
designed for batch processing of images.  That is, it allow you to combine
image processing operations in a script (shell, DOS, Perl, PHP, etc.) so
the operations can be applied to many images, or as
a sub-system of some other tool, such as a Web application, video
processing tool, panorama generator, etc.  <i>It is not a GUI image
editor</i>. </p><p>

ImageMagick is, first of all, an image-to-image converter. That is what it was
originally designed to do.  That is, it will convert an image in just about
any image format (tell us if it can't) to any other image format.  </p><p>

But it is also a library of <i>image processing algorithms</i>.  These can be
access via the command line and shell/DOS scripts (which these example pages
demonstrate), or via a large number of programming languages, such as C, C++,
Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php">ImageMagick APIs</a>. </p><p>

Speed was never a major feature of IM, which places more emphasis on the
quality of the images it generates.  That is not to say that it can't
transform images in a reasonable amount of time. It's just not blindingly
fast.  Because of this, IM can be slow to perform certain processing
operations, especially when attempting to compress images into image formats
that have limited capabilities. </p><p>

ImageMagick concerns itself mainly with images in the form of a <i>rectangular
array of pixels</i>, commonly called a "raster."  It will handle "vector"
image formats like Postscript or PDF, but at the cost of converting those
images into a raster when loading them, and generating a vector image wrapper
around the raster when saving it.  As a result, vector images are often
processed badly when using the default settings.  However, specific options
can be used to improve this situation.  See: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/formats/#vector">A word about vector image formats</a>.  </p>


<h3>About These Examples of ImageMagick Usage</h3><p>

These pages were developed from, and are a continuation of, my <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/info/graphics/imagemagick.hints">Collection of ImageMagick Hints and Tips</a> page I first started in 1993,
and placed on the new fangled world-wide-web making its appearance around the
same time.  Information on many aspects of IM, and notes not included in these
pages, are still present in that document.  However, while the present pages
were designed for you to look at, the hints and tips document was only for my
own edification.  So, it may be vague or chaotic in places.  You are welcome
to look at it, learn, and make comments on it.  </p><p>

Other examples were grabbed or developed from answers to users' questions on
he <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">IM
Forums</a>, or contributed to me as solutions to various problems. </p><p>

I look forward to suggestions and e-mail from other IM users.  Such e-mail
generally results in improvements and expansions to these example pages.
</p>

<h3>Command Line Environments</h3><p>

All examples are written for use on UNIX, and specifically GNU/Linux systems,
using BASH scripting.  As a consequence, some examples use shell 'for-do'
loops. Most examples use a backslash '<code>\</code>' at the end of a line to
continue that command on the next line.  The longer commands are broken into
separate lines to try to further highlight the steps being applied. </p><p>

However, you can still use these examples from <b>PC Windows batch
scripts</b>, with some changes to the handling of certain characters.  With
some slight adaptation, the examples can also be run directly from
'<code>system</code>' calls in <b>PHP scripts</b>.  </p><p>

See <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/windows/">Windows Usage</a> and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/api/index.html">APIs
and Scripting</a> for more information on using the ImageMagick commands in
these alternative environments. Contributions and test examples are welcome.
</p>


<h3>PerlMagick, and Other APIs</h3><p>

It should also be possible to adapt any of these examples to use the IM API
from languages such as Perl, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and so on.  I recommend trying
things out on the command line first, until you get them right, and then
converting the operations to the specific API you are using. </p><p>

Although the situation has improved enormously with IM version 6, the command
line really only deals with a single image sequence at any one time. However,
APIs do not have this limitation, and allow you to manipulate multiple image
sequences, separately or together, to perform more complex operations.  This
ability makes it simpler to implement these examples using the IM API, and
removes the need to save images as temporary files, as many of the command
line examples require. When using an API, only permanent and semi-permanent
images need be saved to disk. </p><p>

Basically, let the example pages give you a start, to let you see what
is possible with ImageMagick.  Then, formulate what you want to do on
the command line, before coding the operations in scripts and API
code, where it is harder to make extensive changes. </p><p>

I also recommend that you comment your API code, <b>heavily</b>, adding the
command line equivalents to what you are trying to do, if possible. That way,
you can check and compare the results against those using the command line.
This lets you debug problems that you may come across later, especially as
improvements are made to image processing in the Core ImageMagick Library.
</p>

<h3>Downloading Input Images and Results</h3><p>

As much as possible, I try to use images built-into IM (such as
"<code>logo:</code>" or "<code>rose:</code>") as input images for IM example
commands, or to generate input images using IM commands.  I also often re-use
the output of previous commands in later examples.  Because of this, you
usually don't need to download any 'test' images in order to try out the
examples yourself. </p><p>

However, such generated or built-in images are not always convenient.  So,
when I do use an external image, I tend to re-use that input image, or the
results of previous examples, for later examples in that section. </p><p>

Sometimes the original source image will be displayed or for larger images
a link to the source image is provided. More commonly only the final resulting
image will be shown, as the input is well known or obvious. </p><p>

Almost all the IM example commands shown are executed in the same web
directory in which they appear.  That is, the command you see is the command
that was actually used to generate the image. Because of this you can modify
the page's URL to download or view the input image(s) used by an example.
Extra copies of the external source images have also been placed in the "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/">images</a>" and "<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/">img_photos</a>"
sub-directories.  See also the example of a <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/img_photos/INDEX.html">Fancy Photo Index</a> of those images. </p><p>


If text output or image information is produced by an example, it is saved to
a text file, and an image of it is generated for display on the Web page.
Selecting the text output image will link you to a copy of the actual text
output by the command.  </p><p>

In all these examples, selecting the output image should let you download the
image which was actually created by the example command. But be warned, not
all browsers understand all image formats used. </p>

<h3>External Image Sources</h3><p>

By the way, most of the source images used in these examples come from <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/">Anthony's Icon
Library</a>, particularly the  <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/desc/cl-bgnd/Icons.html">background tiles</a>, <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/large/Icons.html">large
clip-art</a>, and <a href="https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/dragons/Icons.html">dragons</a> sections of the library. (I like dragons!).  ASIDE: these pages
may be offline as the web site slowly moves to a new server.  </p><p>

This library actually predates the WWW. I created it in 1991, due to the lack
of good, clean iconic images for use on the X Window System.  The advent of
the WWW has of course changed this, but my original library still exists and
remains available as a source of images, even though it is not actively
growing.  </p><p>

Some specific images, and larger images, are contributed by the authors of
specific examples.  The authors of such examples are listed in the contributed
section, or at the bottom of the page. </p><p>

If you are looking for a specific image, I recommend using <a href="http://images.google.com/imghp">Google Image Search</a> (or similar) to
find something appropriate. You can, of course, convert or resize such images
using IM for your own purposes.  However, you should be careful about
copyright if you plan to use such images commercially. </p>


<h3>PNG Images on Web Pages</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>

In many examples, I use an image in PNG format, such as that shown to the
right of this text.  The PNG image format supports images with
semi-transparent pixels, a feature few other image formats provide.  It is
also a very well-understood image format and, as such, is usable by most of
today's image programs and Web browsers.  </p><p>

Some Web browsers, however, do NOT handle transparent PNG images correctly
(most notably Microsoft Internet Explorer v6).  Because of this, I generally
use the JPEG and GIF formats for images on the Web, and only use the PNG
format when generating images with semi-transparent pixels, or when exact
colors are needed for later examples. </p><p>

To allow IE v6 browsers to display PNG images, I use a special 'style sheet'
using complex JavaScript.  For information on this, see <a href="http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG with
transparency for IE</a>. Technically, this is only problem with IE, not
ImageMagick. </p>

<a name="display"></a>
<h3>Displaying Images on Your Screen</h3>

Display problems can also occur when displaying images on-screen.  Because of
this, I recommend using a command like the following to tile
a '<code>checkerboard</code>' pattern underneath the image, to highlight any
transparent or semi-transparent pixels in it.

<div><pre><code do_not_execute="">
    composite  -compose Dst_Over -tile pattern:checkerboard image.png x:
</code></pre></div>
</td><td>
   <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg"><img src="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/test_undertile.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="[IM Output]"></a>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>

The image displayed in the above example is a special PNG-format <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/images/test.png">test image</a>, which was generated using the shell
script "<code><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/scripts/generate_test">generate_test</a></code>".
Normally, the command would output the results to your display, not onto a Web
page like this.  </p><p>

If you look carefully, you can see the checkerboard pattern though the
semi-transparent colors. However, the image, as a whole, is fully opaque.  So,
this technique should work on all displays, Web browsers, and image viewers.
</p><p>

As of IM v6.0.2, the "<code>display</code>" program performs something like
this automatically.  However, it does not seem to handle images using color
tables (i.e., GIF) in this way. Using the "<code>x:</code>" output image format
(as above) causes an …</p></div></div>
