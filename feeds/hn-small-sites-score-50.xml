<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<blockquote>
<p>Black. Magic. Fuckery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the words used by the user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jx360c/for_context_m1_macbook_air/gcvn0oy/">holdagold on reddit</a> to describe their experience with the new Apple Silicon M1 Macbook Air. Rarely does a product leave people effusing to the extent Apple Silicon M1 has done this week. At best, you get the people who really care about a system’s internals very excited like we saw with Zen 3’s launch recently. For everyday users who just want to browse the web, stream some Netflix, maybe edit some documents, computers have been “perfectly fine” for the last decade. We’ve seen incremental year over year improvements with slightly more performance, slightly more battery life, marginally faster SSD, somewhat thinner design, etc. But something genuinely new, something revolutionary, something once in a generation has been missing. I believe the Apple M1 represents something we can truly call “revolutionary”.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, it’s essential to set the context that I’ve only used two Apple devices in my entire life - <em>a personal 2013 MacBook Air and a 2019 MacBook Pro that I got through work</em>. Everything else has been either a custom-built PC, Windows laptop, or an Android/Windows Mobile smartphone. Even for a “PC/Android Guy”, I have to admit what I saw this week is something special. I believe it’ll go down as a significant milestone in computing history on par with some industry-defining chips like Intel’s 8086, 386, 486, Pentium, Conroe or AMD’s K8, Zen, etc. I hope for the return of Moore’s law and awakening of the x86 manufacturers from their slumber as this will be the “<em>slowest</em>” CPU Apple will ever make. <em>As Henry Clay once said</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all human powers operating on the affairs of mankind, none is greater than that of competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog is then my observation of the excitement around this significant launch and captures some of the user and reviewer commentary.</p>

<p>Apple launched its own M1 SoC that integrates an 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, Media encode and decode engines, RAM - all on a single-chip. By including the RAM on the SoC, Apple is marketing this as a Unified Memory Architecture (UMA), central to the performance improvements M1 brings.</p>

</figure>
<p>The first products and price points the M1 will be going into are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mac Mini - $699</li>
<li>MacBook Air 13" - $999</li>
<li>MacBook Pro 13" - $1299</li>
</ol>
<p>Apple promises its new chip is much more energy-efficient than its Intel counterparts, so the battery life promises have gone up across the board:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the MacBook Air - up to 18 hours of video on a single charge (<em>up from 12 hours on this year’s Intel-powered MacBook Air</em>) and offers up to 15 hours of wireless web browsing per charge (<em>up from 11 hours previously</em>)</li>
<li>On the MacBook Pro - up to 17 hours of wireless web browsing (<em>up from 10 hours with this year’s Intel-powered MacBook Pro</em>), and 20 hours of video playback (<em>up from 10 hours before</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>To showcase that energy efficiency, Apple is shipping the Macbook Air without any fan! It will be passively cooled like all iPhones and iPads.</p>


<p>Surprisingly no! Apple included Rosetta 2 ahead-of-time binary translation technology that translates code designed to run on Intel/x86 CPUs for the Apple Silicon CPUs. The performance is much better than expected and ranges between 70-80% of native code, which is surprising compared to Microsoft’s struggles in emulating x86 Windows apps on ARM CPUs. Apple’s answer might lie in something called TSO, aka. total store ordering as explained by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/i0mido/apple_silicon_has_a_runtime_toggle_for_tso_to/">u/Veedrac and and u/ShaidarHaran2 on reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TSO, aka. total store ordering, is a type of memory ordering, and affects how cores see the operations performed in other cores. Total store ordering is a strong guarantee provided by x86, that very roughtly means that all stores from other processors are ordered the same way for every processor, and in a reasonably consistent order, with exceptions for local memory.</p>
<p>In contrast, Arm architectures favour weaker memory models, that allows a lot of reordering of loads and stores. This has the advantage that in general there is less overhead where these guarantees are not needed, but it means that when ordering is required for correctness, you need to explicitly run instructions to ensure it. Emulating x86 would require this on practically every store instruction, which would slow emulation down a lot. That’s what the hardware toggle is for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, Apple has, of course, been playing the very long game. TSO is quite a large benefit to emulating x86, hence why Rosetta 2 appears to put out a very decent 70% of native chip performance, that and install time translation for everything but JIT features. That’s on a chip not even meant to be a mac chip, so with further expanded caches, a wider, faster engine, perhaps applying the little cores to emulation which they’re not currently, and so on, x86_64 performance should be very very decent. I’m going to dare upset some folks and say perhaps even be faster in emulation than most contemporary x86 chips of the time, if you only lose 20% of native performance when it’s all said and done, it doesn’t take much working backwards to figure where they’d need to be, and Gurman said they were aiming for over 50% faster than Intel.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been numerous professional reviews and YouTube videos enumerating how Apple’s new products are better than their previous Intel counterparts. In the end, though, it comes down to how these products fit into the core workflows of the consumer who’s spending their money on them. There have been plenty of real-world experiences that I’ve seen in my filter bubble, mostly Reddit and Twitter. I will share some of these throughout this blog.</p>

<p>People keep saying this but it’s eerily fast and silent, like alien technology. I exported a 5 minute clip in unoptimized Premiere Pro and I swear it did it faster than my PC with a 2070 ever has. The MBP wasn’t even warm to the touch afterwards either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a 2018 15” MacBook Pro which is used almost exclusively in clamshell mode these days and attached to an ultrawide monitor. I use it mainly for photoshop and Lightroom for my photography work, and it’s been painful to say the least. It’s quick for all of two minutes until the fan kicks in with the thermal throttling, at which point the machine chugs to a crawl. I’ve been wanting to get a desktop in replacement, eyeing the previous gen Mac Minis but unable to make the move due to the lack of discrete GPU and an inability to push my monitor’s resolution.</p>
<p>In comes the M1 Mac Mini - I ordered right away and received it Tuesday, and my god has it been a breath of fresh air. First impressions were insanely positive, even hooked to my 5120x1440 display it was lightning fast. But yesterday I put it through the paces with edits from a recent shoot, and it was beyond stellar. More photoshop tabs open than ever before, Lightroom CC and classic open together, nothing could slow it down.</p>
<p>To say I’m impressed with this first gen is a massive understatement, this is shaping up to be one of the most enjoyable devices I’ve ever owned. First computer that hasn’t had some feeling of compromise in a long time.</p>

<h3>How Rainbow Tables work</h3>
<p>I found the creator of Rainbow Table's paper, aimed at cryptanalysts,
was pretty inaccessible considering the simplicity and elegance of
Rainbow Tables, so this is an overview of it for a layman.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hash functions map plaintext to hashes so that you can't tell a
plaintext from its hash.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/1.png"></center>

<p>If you want to find a given plaintext for a certain hash there are two
simple methods:<br>
- Hash each plaintext one by one, until you find the hash.<br>
- Hash each plaintext one by one, but store each generated hash in a
sorted table so that you can easily look the hash up later without
generating the hashes again</p>

<p>Going one by one takes a very long time, and storing each hash takes an
amount of memory which simply doesn't exist (for all but the smallest of
plaintext sets). Rainbow tables are a compromise between pre-computation
and low memory usage.</p>

<p>The key to understanding rainbow tables is understanding the
(unhelpfully named) reduction function.<br>
A hash function maps plaintexts to hashes, the reduction function maps
hashes to plaintexts.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/2.png"></center>


<p>It's important to note that it does the reverse of a hash function
(mapping hashes to plaintexts), but it is /not/ an inverse hash
function. The whole purpose of hash functions is that inverse hash
functions can't be made. If you take the hash of a plaintext, and take
the reduction of the hash, it will not give you the original plaintext;
but some other plaintext.</p>

<p>If the set of plaintexts is [0123456789]{6} (we want a rainbow table of
all numeric passwords of length 6), and the hashing function is MD5(), a
hash of a plaintext might be MD5("493823") -&gt;
"222f00dc4b7f9131c89cff641d1a8c50".<br>
In this case the reduction function R() might be as simple as taking the
first six numbers from the hash; R("222f00dc4b7f9131c89cff641d1a8c50")
-&gt; "222004".<br>
We now have generated another plaintext from the hash of the previous
plaintext, this is the purpose of the reduction function.</p>


<p>Hashes are one-way functions, and so are reduction functions. The chains
which make up rainbow tables are chains of one way hash and reduction
functions starting at a certain plaintext, and ending at a certain hash.
A chain in a rainbow table starts with an arbitrary plaintext, hashes
it, reduces the hash to another plaintext, hashes the new plaintext, and
so on. The table only stores the starting plaintext, and the final hash
you choose to end with, and so a chain "containing" millions of hashes
can be represented with only a single starting plaintext, and a single
finishing hash.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/3.png"></center>


<p>After generating many chains the table might look something like:<br>
iaisudhiu -&gt; 4259cc34599c530b1e4a8f225d665802<br>
oxcvioix -&gt; c744b1716cbf8d4dd0ff4ce31a177151<br>
9da8dasf -&gt; 3cd696a8571a843cda453a229d741843<br>
[...]<br>
sodifo8sf -&gt; 7ad7d6fa6bb4fd28ab98b3dd33261e8f</p>

<hr>

<p>The chains are now ready to be used. We have a certain hash with an
unknown plaintext, and we want to check to see whether it is inside any
of the generated chains.</p>

<p>The algorithm is:<br>
</p><ul><li>Look for the hash in the list of final hashes, if it is there break
out of the loop.</li>
<li>If it isn't there reduce the hash into another plaintext, and hash the
new plaintext.</li>
<li>Goto the start.</li>
<li>If the hash matches one of the final hashes, the chain for which the
hash matches the final hash contains the original hash.</li></ul>
You can now get that chain's starting plaintext, and start hashing and
reducing it, until you come to the known hash along with its secret
plaintext.

<p>In this way you check through the hashes in the chains, which aren't
actually stored anywhere on disk, by iterating column by column through
the table of chains, backwards from the last column in the chain, to the
starting plaintext.</p>

<hr>
<p>If you wanted to check whether the hash exists in the last column of any 
of the chains you reduce and hash the given hash once, then check the 
generated hash against the chain end hashes.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a1.png"></center>

<p>You can check the second last column by reducing and hashing twice, 
then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a2.png"></center>

<p>And the third is checked by reducing and hashing three times, 
then check the generated hash against the chain end hashes.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a3.png"></center>

<p>Supposing
a chain ending matches the generated hash the matching chain end might
contain the hash. The starting plaintext which was stored with the ending 
hash can be reduced and hashed until the correct plaintext is found within 
the chain.
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/a4.png"></center>

<hr>

<p>Collisions are the only problem with Rainbow Tables. Ironically
collisions are seen as a bad thing for hashing algorithms, but in the
case of Rainbow Tables a hashing algorithm which generates collisions
fairly regularly will be more secure.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/5.png"></center><br>
A given hash may be generated by multiple plaintexts (this is called a
collision), which is a big problem for chains because it causes chains
which start different to converge into one. Also you get loops, which
are caused when a hash is reduced to a plaintext that was hashed at a
previous point in the chain.<br>
<center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/6.png"></center>


<p>Because of these collision problems there is no guarantee that there
will be a hash of a plaintext that will reduce to some other given
plaintext.<br>
If you have a simple list of hashes and corresponding plaintexts for
every plaintext in a set you will know that if you have not found the
hash in the generated hashes the plaintext that generated the hash is
not in the set.<br>
If you have a table of chains where the reduction function reduces
hashes into the set of plaintexts you could have trillions of chains
generated but you still may not have generated every plaintext in the
set you want to check. You can only say how probable it is that a table
of chains contains a certain plaintext, and this can approach 1 but will
probably never reach 1.<br>
If you have a rainbow table with 10 chains of length 100 you have hashed
1000 plaintexts, but even if there are only 100 plaintexts in the set of
desired plaintexts the 1000 hashes you have in the chains may not
contain all the desired hashes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The way collisions are handled is what sets Rainbow Tables apart from
its predecessor which was developed in 1980.</p>

<p>The predecessor solved the problem of certain plaintexts never being
reduced to by using many small tables. Each small table uses a different
reduction function. This doesn't solve the problem completely, but it
does help.<br>
To solve chain merges and loops each chain ended at a "distinct point";
a hash which was unique in some way, eg hashes where the first 4
characters are 0. The chains keep on going until it reaches a distinct
point. If two chains end up at the same distinct point then there has
been a collision somewhere in the chain, and one of the chains is
discarded. If a chain is generated for an unusually long time without
reaching a distinct point a loop is suspected (where a chain of hashes
ends up reducing and hashing to a previous hash in the chain).
The problem with this is that if there is a collision there is
potentially a whole branch which has to be cut off and won't make it
into the chains, and a loop will cause all the hashes which came before
the loop in the chain to be discarded.<br>
</p><center><img src="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/7.png"></center><br>
Also all the time spend generating that chain will be wasted, and by
ending only at distinct points you have chains of variable length. This
means that you may have to keep checking for a hash within especially
long chains long after the other chains have ended.

<hr>

<p>Rainbow tables differ in that they don't use multiple tables with
different reduction functions, they only use one table. However in
Rainbow Tables a different reduction function is used for each column.
This way different tables with different reduction functions aren't
needed, because different reduction functions are used within the same
table. It is still unlikely that all plaintexts in the desired set will
be hashed, but the chances are higher for a given number of chains.
Chain merges are much, much rarer, because collisions have to occur on
the same column. For a chain of length l the chance of a collision
causing a merge is reduced to 1/l. Loops are also solved, because if a
hash in a chain is the same as a previous hash it won't reduce to the
same plaintext.</p>

<p>The reason they're called Rainbow Tables is because each column uses a
different reduction function. If each reduction function was a different
color, and you have starting plaintexts at the top and final hashes at
the bottom, it would look like a rainbow (a very vertically long and
thin one).<br>
By using Rainbow Tables the only problem that remains is that you can
never be certain that the chains contain all the desired hashes, to get
higher success rates from a given Rainbow Table you have to generate
more and more chains, and get diminishing returns.</p>

<p>I hope by explaining the Rainbow Table I haven't made them any less 
wonderful ...</p>

<h4>An easy way to improve on the "rainbowcrack" Rainbow Tables implementation</h4>
<p>This section probably goes a bit beyond where a layman would be comfortable, 
but if you're interested in the practical applications of the above theory or have some 
interest in cryptography read on..</p>

<p>The rainbowcrack application is how most people come to learn 
about Rainbow Tables, because it is the application which puts the 
theory above into code. It has been very successful, with many websites 
dedicated to generating rainbowcrack hash tables and letting users search them.</p>

<p>However there is a pretty clear way this application could be improved, 
very easily, in the sense that the generated tables would take up a lot less
disk space, but be equally as effective for breaking hashes:</p>

<p>Remember above that when you want to generate a certain chain 
you start from an arbitrary hash. This just means it doesn't matter where 
you choose to start from. The rainbowcrack application starts from a randomly 
generated 64-bit number. This number is then used to generate a chain which 
ultimately ends with a 128-bit hash, which is reduced to another 64-bit number.</p>

<p>Why use a randomly generated number as the starting point? A …</p></div>

<a href="https://aakinshin.net/tags/performance-telemetry/">Performance Telemetry</a></span></p><p>Imagine that you are implementing performance telemetry in your application.
There is an operation that is executed millions of times, and you want to get its “average” duration.
It’s not a good idea to use the arithmetic mean because the obtained value can be easily spoiled by outliers.
It’s much better to use the median which is one of the most robust ways to describe the average.</p><p>The straightforward median estimation approach requires storing all the values.
In our case, it’s a bad idea to keep all the values because it will significantly increase the memory footprint.
Such telemetry is harmful because it may become a new bottleneck instead of monitoring the actual performance.</p><p>Another way to get the median value is to use a sequential quantile estimator
(also known as an online quantile estimator or a streaming quantile estimator).
This is an algorithm that allows calculating the median value (or any other quantile value)
using a fixed amount of memory.
Of course, it provides only an approximation of the real median value,
but it’s usually enough for typical telemetry use cases.</p><p>In this post, I will show one of the simplest sequential quantile estimators that is called the P² quantile estimator
(or the Piecewise-Parabolic quantile estimator).</p><h3 id="the-p-quantile-estimator">The P² quantile estimator</h3><p>This algorithm was initially suggested in <a href="#Jain1985">[Jain1985]</a>.
Below you can find a short overview of this approach,
notes about typos in the original paper,
numerical simulation,
and a C# implementation.</p><h4 id="the-main-idea">The main idea</h4><p>Let’s say we have a stream of observations <span>\(\{ x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, \ldots \}\)</span>
and we want to estimate p-quantile.
The suggested approach introduces five markers that correspond to the estimations of</p><ul><li><span>\(q_0\)</span>: The minimum</li><li><span>\(q_1\)</span>: The (p/2)-quantile</li><li><span>\(q_2\)</span>: The p-quantile</li><li><span>\(q_3\)</span>: The ((1+p)/2)-quantile</li><li><span>\(q_4\)</span>: The maximum</li></ul><p>The <span>\(q_i\)</span> values are known as the marker heights.</p><p>Also, we have to maintain the marker positions <span>\(\{ n_0, n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4 \}\)</span>.
These integer values describe actual marker indexes across obtained observations at the moment.</p><p>Next, we have to define the marker desired positions <span>\(\{ n'_0, n'_1, n'_2, n'_3, n'_4 \}\)</span>.
For the first <span>\(n\)</span> observations, these real values are defined as follows:</p><ul><li><span>\(n'_0 = 0\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_1 = (n - 1) p / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_2 = (n - 1) p\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_3 = (n - 1) (1 + p) / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(n'_4 = (n - 1)\)</span></li></ul><p>In order to speed up the algorithm, we can precalculate increments of the desired positions which
should be added to the current values after each new observation:</p><ul><li><span>\(dn'_0 = 0\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_1 = p / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_2 = (n - 1) p\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_3 = (n - 1) (1 + p) / 2\)</span></li><li><span>\(dn'_4 = (n - 1)\)</span></li></ul><p>Note that in the original paper, the authors use one-based indexing.
I decided to adapt it to the zero-based indexing which is more convenient from the implementation point of view.</p><h4 id="initialization">Initialization</h4><p>Once we collected the first five elements, we should perform initialization logic:</p><p><span>\[\left\{

q_3 = x_{(3)}, &amp; n_3 = 3, &amp; n'_3 = 2 + 2p, &amp; dn'_3 = (1+p)/2,\\

find <span>\(k\)</span> such that <span>\(q_k \leq x_j &lt; q_{k+1}\)</span>

    <p>Earlier this year, I was in the position to choose the framework for the startup at which I’m now the CTO. I
could’ve chosen anything. I went with Rails.  And you should, too. It still is the best framework for getting up
and running <em>and</em> for continued iteration and development.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Writing a web app requires many moving pieces.  If you use something like Spring, Node, Express, or any other basic
library, you have a <em>lot</em> of decisions to make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How are URLs routed to code?</li>
  <li>How are headers, params, and request bodies parsed?</li>
  <li>Where does the code live to manage this?</li>
  <li>How are responses created?</li>
  <li>How do we generate dynamic HTML?</li>
  <li>How do we mitigate against common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting?</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, web apps almost always have a database, which leads to more decisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will we access the database?</li>
  <li>How is the database schema managed?</li>
  <li>What conventions will we use for table and column names?</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, there are concerns around the development environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we write tests?</li>
  <li>How can we execute a test using a web browser?</li>
  <li>How do we manage the data needed for our tests?</li>
  <li>How do we manage data needed to run the app locally?</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there are concerns around deployment and production:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do I get JavaScript packaged for the browser?</li>
  <li>How do I manage CSS?</li>
  <li>How do I create cacheable bundles for CDNs?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-making-so-many-decisions">The Cost of Making So Many Decisions</h2>

<p>These decisions are only the beginning.  I’ve worked on web apps that used libraries only—no frameworks—and all of
these decisions plus more had to be made. Many had to be made before the team could start working.  But as time
went by and the team’s composition changed, managing these decisions was a constant tax.</p>

<p>…managing these decisions was a constant tax</p>

<p>Because <em>we</em> made these decisions and <em>we</em> configured our libraries to work in a particular way, it was not
uncommon for developers to want to know why we did it that way, and could we change it?  Many of these decisions
amount to conventions not enforceable with code, so a good chunk of our code reviews required making sure everyone
followed the conventions.</p>

<p>And then we would update our libraries to find out they were suddenly incompatible.  Because we’d hand-selected
libraries to solve each problem, we had no way to guarantee they all worked together other than making sure our app
still worked.  It was hard to see the value in the series of decisions that led to this architecture.</p>

<h2 id="stop-making-so-many-decisions">Stop Making So Many Decisions</h2>

<p>With Rails, you don’t have to make <em>any</em> of the decisions above. None.  Once you type <code>rails new</code> all of those
decisions are made.  True, there are more decisions you will have to make, but Rails will have eliminated a huge number of ultimately pointless decisions.</p>

<p>Rails will have eliminated a huge number of ultimately pointless decisions</p>

<p>It simply doesn’t matter how JavaScript is packaged, what your database naming conventions are, or how HTTP requests are routed to code. You need answers and conventions for all of that, yes, but the actual conventions don’t matter.</p>

<p>What you also need are the conventions to be enforced or managed in code, not documentation. That way, everyone is
incentivized to focus on the problems specific to their domain instead of the plumbing of their app.</p>



<p>This has been the value proposition for Rails since its inception over 15 year ago.  In that time, Rails and its
ecosystem have matured, improved, and continued moving forward.  The value Rails brings is still needed, and it is
<em>still</em> the best framework for most teams.</p>

<p>Engineers without Rails experience may continue to believe the fantasy that Rails does not scale or that it can’t
be used for “serious” problems.  Those of us <em>with</em> Rails experience know this isn’t true.  But what we also worry
about is that Rails apps can become unmaintainable.</p>

<h2 id="rails-helps-maintainability">Rails Helps Maintainability</h2>

<p>Hopefully, it’s obvious that no framework or set of libraries can ensure maintainability.  I would argue that Rails
gives you a better chance.  Rails—and its ecosystem—tend to evolve together, so you can rely on the stability of
your core tools over many years.</p>

<p>Rails basis in conventions also means that there are generally fewer parts of an app to get crufty as time goes by.
But, it’s still up to the team to establish conventions and ways of working to capitalize on that.  As it would be
on any team.</p>

<p>So what happens when the team stops making pointless decisions, worrying about library compatibility, and spending
code-review time on conventions?  They start thinking about the problems they need to solve. That’s why Rails is
the best web framework for most teams.</p>

Statements like this often quote the mind-boggling amount of data produced on the internet using exotic-sounding words like zettabytes per day as proof. To function in this sea of data, we're supposed to find signals in the noise and read from credible sources of news and other information. With news media taking political stances, it's not that easy.</p><p>My assertion, paradoxically, is that polarization has greatly diminished the <em>quantity of information</em> being produced and consumed via today's press despite the sea of content they produce. The result is a loss of the press's effectiveness in their two functions within a healthy democracy, as a check on government and promoter of informed debate.</p><h2>Information</h2><p>It's important to define terms. What is information?</p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a> definition, the quantity of information in a message is related to the amount of <em>surprise</em> it contains. This idea of surprise is key so I'm going to spend some time on it.</p><p>Let's imagine you're receiving messages about some set of data and you're trying to determine its distribution. Each message contains one data point. Early on, as you receive messages, the information provided by each piece of data is high because you know very little about the data itself. With each new piece of information, you start to construct a representation of the overall data set like the one shown in the image below.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606176449103_6575"><div><p>After some number of points, you realize the data is a normal distribution or bell-curve and you can make some determination about its structure. In this case, the mean or average value as well as its width (or standard deviation). Let's say the average value is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This means that 68% of the values will be between -1 and 1, 95% will be between -2 and 2, and &gt;99% will be between -3 and 3.</p><p>Great! Let's say the next set of messages that you get are 0, 0.1, and 1. Those numbers are completely within the expected range we calculated earlier. There's nothing particularly surprising about them, and as a result, <strong>there is almost no information</strong> contained within them.</p><p>What if you get a message of 10? Now there's a problem. There's almost no chance that the distribution we described above should include a value of 10. Getting 10 is very surprising. So surprising that it may mean the model we had for this data is entirely wrong. That's a lot of information contained in one message of 10, way more than the other messages we got earlier.</p><p>Why does 10 have so much information? It's because it's surprising. It causes us to challenge the model we had built. It could be that the message was a mistake, a fluke. But it could also be that the conclusions we held were wrong. <strong>The more high-information messages like this we get, the more we should start to challenge the beliefs we previously held.</strong> Now let's get back to media.</p><h2>News media</h2><p>In today's polarized media, each side of the media discourse has established its perspective, and the content they publish conforms to this perspective. When you go to a news outlet with a particular leaning, you may not know exactly what stories they'll be writing about, but you do know what <em>kind</em> of stories will be covered and from what perspective. Your knowledge about that outlet's outlook was built up over time as you encountered what they publish.</p><p>When one outlet consistently publishes pieces that align with their perspective, the information content provided by each article starts to diminish. When the theme of each article aligns within the expected distribution, there's no surprise and thus no information.</p><p>It's important to take a moment to distinguish surprise from shock. As you may be familiar, it's common for media to publish stories that have a shock value as they compete with other organizations for your attention. What I'm discussing in this essay isn't the shock value or the particular event that the news media is writing about, it's the perspective of the news organization and the degree of surprise that they published it. For example, you might be shocked at the behavior of one political party's behavior, but are you surprised by it, and more importantly, are you surprised that a news organization that takes the opposite position is publishing a story about it? Shock and surprise can be related, but there's a distinction here between headlines that are attention-grabbing and whether the content fits the mold of the news organization's narrative.</p><h2>Implications</h2><p>The danger of this is two-fold. First, if you only read from one source or a set of sources with similar outlooks, the media source's perspective can start to become yours. You end up with a world-view that aligns with the publisher's view. Since that source never prints anything which disputes that view, your perspective on the world becomes insulated and unchallenged. It's like the example above where we thought we knew the distribution was a bell-curve until we got a few message outliers. Those outliers demanded we reconsider our earlier conclusions. Except this time, <strong>the outliers exist but we never receive them</strong>. We go about our days oblivious to information that would challenge our world-view because it doesn't get published anywhere we look.</p><p>"<em>A free press is one of the pillars of democracy</em>." - Nelson Mandela</p><p>The second danger involves the media's role as a check on government. The branches of government exist to prevent the abuse of power by one another. <strong>The press exists to prevent the abuse of information by the government.</strong> It should question and investigate claims by the government to inform voters and further civic discourse.</p><p>However, this function requires the press to be viewed as impartial, truth-seeking, and without advancing an opinion except where explicitly noted (i.e. the opinion section). If the average voter comes to distrust the press, this function is lost. Articles that would normally inform the voter, providing surprise and evidence that would counter a particular world-view, instead go unread or dismissed. Voters either write off the press entirely or read solely from outlets with views that align with their own further solidifying their own beliefs. In either case, we end up with tribes of perspectives unwilling to seek a compromise that can allow the country to proceed collectively.</p><p>I'm not claiming that all reporters are like this. There are excellent reporters that seek truth regardless of politics. Unfortunately, this independent perspective is increasingly difficult to find. Well-reasoned, objective reporting doesn't generate the same attention as partisan emotion.</p><p>Instead, our press needs to promote information and surprise without bias. By only publishing from one narrative, they insulate the public (and themselves!) from information that could lead to honest debate and discovery. Likewise, our opinions should be formed from a careful examination of arguments and evidence on each side of the issue, <strong>reading from only one perspective is akin to not reading at all.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><strong>The End-of-Year Checklist</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></em><em><span></span></em></p>
<p><span>I like starting the year with an empty to-do list and a fresh perspective. As an obsessive list maker, this process naturally starts with another list. Some of the questions can be treated as action items, but many require deeper reflection (perfect for the quiet week at the end of the year). I hope that you find it useful as you close out 2020!</span></p>

<h5><strong>As a Company</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>What actions most moved the company forward and how can we double down on them? What should we have spent less time doing?&nbsp;</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Using the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/?sh=15a5959d3814"><span>Pareto Principle</span></a><span>, the return on certain actions will significantly outweigh others.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Did our actions reflect our values? Did we call out times that employees personified our values? Do we need to add or subtract values?</span></li>
<li><span>Which relationships are most important to our success (e.g. customers, investors, partners) and what can we be doing to provide them with more value?</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>As a Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Do we have the </span><a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html"><span>right people on the bus</span></a><span>?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the right people owning the right things or are there better ways that we can be distributing the work?</span><br><span></span><span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>I keep a Trello board to manage this; <a data-cke-saved-href="https://trello.com/b/v6lu8Xpc" href="https://trello.com/b/v6lu8Xpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steal my template here</a>.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/j9hSXZluRBG3S2HjajIu" alt="trello chart" width="683" height="158"></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How were my 1:1s? Did my reports walk away feeling that I had removed blockers, clarified vagueness, and given clear instructions?</span></li>
<li><span>Do my reports know their metrics for success?</span></li>
<li><span>How connected is the team overall?</span><strong></strong><span></span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Meetings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Is every meeting on my calendar still relevant and useful?</span></li>
<li><span>Have I invited the right people to each one?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the major meetings for the upcoming year already scheduled? Mine are:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Off-sites</span></li>
<li><span>Customers business reviews</span></li>
<li><span>Employee reviews</span></li>
<li><span>Team town halls</span></li>
<li><span>Quarterly kickoffs</span></li>
<li><span>Annual trainings</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Do I like the cadence and timing of my recurring meetings?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Can I schedule any back-to-back to minimize distractions?</span></li>
<li><span>Are meetings optimized to my energy peaks?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>I’m fresh and driven in the mornings and do my best work then. Mentally challenging meetings are best during this window.</span></li>
<li><span>My mind is more relaxed and able to freely brainstorm in the afternoons; I shift most meetings to this time.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Tools</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Are we using the right tools (software, banking, equipment, etc.) to accomplish our goals? Can we eliminate any?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/exgcpuvKRdmBDDBzKUvF" alt="saas-list" width="772" height="101">
<figcaption>
<p><span>This number balloons quickly, so I keep a spreadsheet of all our tools to track which are still in use and who has access.</span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><span>Do the right people have access to each tool? Has admin access been given to the logical person?</span></li>
<li><span>Do we have the right tier of service for our size?</span></li>
<li><span>Are there more effective tools available that could reduce or combine the efforts of others?&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Finance</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Are our finances generally in order? This can include:</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Outstanding invoices</span></li>
<li><span>Unpaid bills</span></li>
<li><span>Sales commissions</span></li>
<li><span>Expense reconciliation</span></li>
<li><span>Credit card charges</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Are there areas that we could cut costs next year?</span></li>
<li><span>Is billing set to preferred person and method? (I like to see every charge come through and to optimize points based on spend.)</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Operations</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Where can we automate tasks?</span></li>
<li><span>Are the company files clean and organized? What about mine?</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>If a company file no longer seems relevant, I dump it into an archive folder rather than delete anything.</span></li>
<li><span>I run an inbox-zero on my file downloads and desktop, forcing myself to put any important files somewhere safe in case something happens to my computer.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Are our templated documents up to date?</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Check company address, point of contact, and legalese on contracts, mNDAs, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>How are our processes? Which ones are sloppy, overly prescriptive, or begging to be eliminated entirely?</span></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Performance</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>How did I perform against my job description?</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>I keep my job description as a living document to capture what I take on and hand off over time. When I doubt where my time is being spent, I discuss this document with my boss and adjust accordingly.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>How were my 1:1s with my boss? Did I come to the meeting with thoughtful questions and specific to-dos?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Did I listen to and incorporate feedback effectively?</span></li>
<li><span>Did I step up when I needed to? Did I delegate my areas of weakness?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Role</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>How do I want my job description to change in the next year based on what the company needs and on my own strengths and weaknesses?</span></li>
<li><span>Which relationships within the company are most important to my efficacy? Can I do anything to improve upon those relationships?</span></li>
<li><span>Which tasks I should be taking on or offloading?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Time</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Am I spending time on </span><a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/time-management-for-founders/"><span>the most valuable things</span></a><span> and letting the unimportant things fall through the cracks?</span></li>
<li><span>What have I been putting off?&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Can I eliminate it or delegate it?</span></li>
<li><span>Can I give it more clarity?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<ul>
<li><span>I tend to dread tasks that either feel pointless or excessively vague, so I ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>What can I stop doing altogether?</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Personal</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Do I like my personal systems for keeping track of to-dos?</span></li>
<li><span>Do I know what I bring to the table when I join a meeting?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I maintaining a network of people I can turn to for advice?</span></li>
<li><span>Am I making time outside of work for activities that keep me healthy and happy?</span></li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As an indie hacker, we all struggle to validate our ideas, get our first users, and get some traffic. I played a lot with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xAvi_r">Reddit</a> for the last few months, and I can tell you: it’s a gold mine!</p><p>Reddit is super powerful:&nbsp;there are millions of users on the platform, each subreddit is very segmented by niche, and it’s free to use!</p><p>We sometimes see it as an intimidating platform, but it’s not that hard.</p><p>Here is how I&nbsp;use it:</p><h2 id="validate-your-idea">Validate your idea</h2><p>The first step of your indie hacker journey is to validate your idea. You don’t want to spend weeks building something nobody wants. But it can be hard to find your potential customers to validate your product idea.</p><p>With Reddit, you can do it easily. There are subreddits dedicated to Ideas’ feedback. You can post your idea there and you will get some responses within 24hrs. The feedback can be pretty generic as the people in these subs are mostly entrepreneurs and not your potential customer.</p><p>To validate my product idea I prefer to post directly on the sub I&nbsp;want to target. Let’s say you create a tool for developers then I’d post to /r/webdev. You don’t need to have a working MVP, just make some screenshot (or a video) and ask for feedback. Or, even better show them a landing page with a pre-order button or an email form and wait for their reactions.</p><p><em>(For the idea validation step, don’t be afraid to post on a big subreddit with hundreds of thousands of users, the more people see your idea the stronger your validation will be)</em></p><p>Within 24hrs you’ll know if that idea is worth pushing! If you get positive feedback - or even pre-orders - you can build your MVP. If you’re ignored or trashed, then find another way or get another idea!</p><h2 id="get-your-first-users">Get your first users</h2><p>Once your MVP is ready you need a bunch of beta testers to give you some feedback.
Reddit can also help you with that.</p><p>But this time I’d go with a small subreddit, and a super targeted one. Let’s say you created a no-code tool for startups, I’ll try to get my early adopters from /r/nocode (3.7k members) instead of posting on /r/startups (517k members) for instance. It’s a small subreddit, very niche. Then, once you have the first feedback you can iterate on it and post on some bigger subs.</p><p>The idea of “incremental launches” is to start small, build an audience, get some feedback, and grow step by step. Once the super-targeted subreddit loves your product you can start to post on big subreddit and get some traction.</p><p><em>PS: Small subreddit are super powerful if you choose them wisely. I got more than <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti/status/1325847913466048516">400 visits</a> in 48hrs from my last post on /r/nocode!</em></p><h2 id="get-some-traffic">Get some traffic</h2><p>Last step of the process: your MVP is ready, you need some traffic. And you want a lot of it!</p><p>The strategy here is to create some content around your product and share it with big subreddits. The secret is to provide as much value as you can. Share your secrets, how you grow your product, share your analytics, how much money you make, what did you learn during your journey, etc… It needs to be valuable and targeted to an audience.</p><p>Post your content to the biggest subreddits like /r/Entrepreneur, /r/Programming, or /r/Marketing and add a link to your product/blog at the end (Check the rules of the sub first, but most of them are ok with it)</p><p>If your content is well-targeted and brings some serious value you can get thousands of visitors in a day! And it’s totally repeatable. As long as you can provide value you’ll get some free traffic!</p><p>Do you want to launch on Reddit?

    <p>A coworker and I were looking at an application today that, like so many other
modern web applications, offers a RESTful API with JSON being used for
serialization of requests/responses.  She noted that the application didn’t
include any sort of CSRF token and didn’t seem to use any of the headers
(X-Requested-With, Referer, Origin, etc.) as a “poor man’s CSRF token”, but
since it was posting JSON, was it really vulnerable to CSRF?  <strong>Yes, yes,
definitely yes!</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, this is reminiscent of many of the confusions between server and
browser that are described in Michal Zalewski’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2QyTUaH">The Tangled
Web</a>.</p>

<p>The idea that the use of a particular encoding is a security boundary is, at
worst, a completely wrong notion of security, and at best, a stopgap until W3C,
browser vendors, or a clever attacker gets hold of your API.  Let’s examine JSON
encoding as a protection against CSRF and demonstrate a mini-PoC.</p>

<h3 id="the-application">The Application</h3>

<p>We have a basic application written in Go.  Authentication checking is elided
for post size, but this is <em>not</em> just an unauthenticated endpoint.</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, it basically serves a secret number that can be updated via
HTTP POST of a JSON object.  If we attempt a URL-encoded or multipart POST, the
JSON decoding fails miserably and the secret remains unchanged.  We must POST
JSON in order to get the secret value changed.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-options">Exploring Options</h3>

<p>So let’s explore our options here.  The site can locally use AJAX via the
XMLHTTPRequest API, but due to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">Same-Origin
Policy</a>,
an attacker’s site cannot use this.  For most CSRF, the way to get around this
is plain HTML forms, since form submission is not subject to the Same-Origin
Policy.  The W3C had a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-json-forms/">draft specification for JSON
forms</a>, but that has been abandoned
since late 2015, and isn’t supported in any browsers.  There are probably some
techniques that can make use of Flash or other browser plugins (aren’t there
always?) but it can even be done with basic forms, it just takes a little work.</p>

<h3 id="json-in-forms">JSON in Forms</h3>

<p>Normally, if we try to POST JSON as, say, a form value, it ends up being URL encoded,
not to mention including the field name.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;form</span> <span>method=</span><span>'POST'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;input</span> <span>name=</span><span>'json'</span> <span>value=</span><span>'{"foo": "bar"}'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;input</span> <span>type=</span><span>'submit'</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Results in a POST body of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>json=%7B%22foo%22%3A+%22bar%22%7D
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Good luck decoding that as JSON!</p>

<p>Doing it as the form field name doesn’t get any better.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>%7B%22foo%22%3A+%22bar%22%7D=value
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It turns out you can set the enctype of your form to <code>text/plain</code> and avoid the
URL encoding on the form data.  At this point, you’ll get something like:</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we still have to contend with the form field name and the
separator (<code>=</code>).  This is a simple matter of splitting our payload across both
the field name and value, and sticking the equals sign in an unused field.  (Or
you can use it as part of your payload if you need one.)</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it All Together</h3>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;body</span> <span>onload=</span><span>'document.forms[0].submit()'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;form</span> <span>method=</span><span>'POST'</span> <span>enctype=</span><span>'text/plain'</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;input</span> <span>name=</span><span>'{"secret": 1337, "trash": "'</span> <span>value=</span><span>'"}'</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/form&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This results in a request body of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>{"secret": 1337, "trash": "="}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This parses just fine and updates our secret!</p>

November 24, 2020 | https://adamfard.com/blog/enterprise-ux | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://adamfard.com/blog/enterprise-ux">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-content"><p>“Don’t make me think” is a renowned mantra in the world of design, coined by Steve Krug. It has served as a guiding principle in the world of design and UX for twenty&nbsp;years. It teaches us how to create great experiences in a straightforward and accessible manner.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s article, we’d like to look into enterprise design and its peculiarities. It’s essential to underline that the very nature of enterprise UX slightly differs from consumer UX. As a result, some of Krug’s principles must be adjusted when designing enterprise software.&nbsp;</p><p>This article is by no means a refutation of the design principle. Please treat it as a mere asterisk with a fine print at the bottom.</p><h2><strong>Learning curves aren’t inherently bad</strong></h2><p>According to Krug, products that make people think also make people unhappy. <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-learning-curve-design-problem-4d4dc2965098">Products with steep learning curves</a> very rarely succeed in the modern business ecosystem. Customers will pretty much always choose the path of least resistance. This isn’t necessarily true of enterprise products.</p><p>Enterprise users are power users — and it’s imperative that we take this into account when designing products for them. They interact with niche software on a daily basis and quite possibly for many years. They know their way around the logic of the products they use.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating an interface that demands some learning results in a steeper learning curve isn’t inherently wrong. It allows users to work more efficiently once they’ve invested a certain amount of time into training and learning.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606137908-figma-shortcuts-cheatsheet-1014x487.jpg?w=900&amp;auto=compress"><figcaption><a href="https://www.figmacrush.com/figma-shortcuts-cheatsheet/">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Take, for instance, products like Figma, Sketch, Adobe Pro, or any other professional software — most of them have a wide array of shortcuts. Features such as shortcuts may take a while to master, but they’ll ensure a significant boost in productivity once learned.&nbsp;</p><h2>Simplify cautiously&nbsp;</h2><p>We’re very well aware of the importance of keeping interfaces simple and obvious. However, it’s essential to keep in mind the complexity of the tasks typically performed in enterprise software. The pursuit for a clean UI could rid users of the vital context necessary to get work done.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, it can be argued that by making the interface too simple, we risk generating friction rather than eliminating it. Let’s envision an interface of a product that displays a wide array of charts and data, like a trading platform.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606138044-image2.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>A professional that regularly interacts with visual data needs immediate access to it at all times. Having to perform extra actions to access vital features is both frustrating and unproductive. And here lies one of the most significant differences between consumer UX and enterprise UX (eUX).&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer UX is really passionate about sleek UIs, while enterprise software must ensure that users are able to do their work comfortably. Therefore, simplified, minimalistic interfaces aren’t really what eUX designers are after.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wizards are cool, but…</h2><p><a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/ux-onboarding">Onboarding your users</a> is a vital step aimed at ensuring optimal user experience. However, while Wizards and guided tours are an excellent solution for casual users, it’s not necessarily the case for power users.&nbsp;</p><p>In both consumer and enterprise UX, designers must aim to develop products that require <a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/stickiness">as little hand-holding as possible</a>. However, simplistic product tours can be… well, simplistic. They often fail to uncover the entire functionality of a product, which is especially relevant for experienced users.&nbsp;</p><p>After running a series of tests, we found out that enterprise users tend to prefer to leave the app or platform for instructions. While this does seem somewhat disruptive to the experience of a product — it is understandable.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606210515-initiative-alladded1-1.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>Off-page instructions can provide more in-depth explanations rather than the ones that are placed on the screen. Compare, for instance, a tool-tip and an article dedicated to a particular function.&nbsp;</p><h2>Plan for non-linear flows&nbsp;</h2><p>When it comes to designing eUX UIs, designers face a truly arduous task of creating complex, non-linear flows. These flows often involve a variety of roles, profile types, responsibilities, kinds of security, and much more. Our goal is to create a consistent and recognizable experience throughout all of these variables.&nbsp;</p><p>The complicated part, however, is not to force users into flows and scenarios. Experts and professional users need that freedom to make decisions and use the platform as they see fit.</p><p>Think of a person that is deeply versed in Microsoft Excel. They’ve been using this software for nearly a decade, and they know it like the back of their hand. More importantly, they have their style of working and solving problems. Limiting such users via linear and rigid flows could defeat the purpose of boosting their productivity.&nbsp;</p><h2>Don’t fix it if it’s not broken</h2><p>Innovation is a crucial element of UX design. We strive to continuously seek new and creative solutions to old problems. Often, we can even choose to be bold and put forth experimental solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when it comes to eUX, we have to be somewhat more conservative and experiment with caution. Enterprise software isn’t quite receptive to design solutions that go against the grain.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the central purpose of such software is to deliver quality work in short amounts of time, “reinventing the wheel” isn’t always a great idea.&nbsp;</p><p>When designing for enterprise, keeping an eye on your competition is even more relevant than in consumer software.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s go back to Excel once more — imagine <a href="https://adamfard.com/blog/website-redesign">you’re trying to reinvent</a> a complex, spreadsheet-based product. You’re looking to change the ways it represents data, or certain actions are performed. While this does sound like a laudable task, the critical question is — why?&nbsp;</p><p>In eUX, the real value of a product is in its unique selling point that is translated via a design that looks familiar and intuitive.&nbsp;</p><p>That is not to say that the light of innovation never shines on enterprise products, but user expectations often trim the lengths we can go.&nbsp;</p><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>In order to reward you, our beloved reader, for making it till the end, we’ve designed a picture that summarizes the arguments in this article. We hope it will come in handy.</p><p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/16499/1606138895-enterprise-ux-summary.png?w=900&amp;auto=compress"></p><p>While the principles of “don’t make me think” will most likely outlive us, it’s crucial to outline the situations where they can be somewhat amended.&nbsp;</p><p>Enterprise user experience is a slightly more conservative field in terms of design, yet these limitations push us to become even more creative. By operating within these constraints, we have the power to make the future of work exciting and even more promising.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta: In this article, we explore the peculiarities of enterprise user experience design (eUX) through the lens of the “Don’t make me think” principle.&nbsp;</p></article></div>]]>

November 24, 2020 | https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>If you followed the recent Apple events, you probably saw a picture of the A14 and M1 dies… that got me thinking about what you would see if you could pass iOS under X-Rays…</p>
<p>In my previous article about the <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a>, I analyzed iOS based on the number of binaries and their programming languages. As I pointed out in this past post, the size of the binaries were not taken in account. In this new article, I look at iPhone OS 1.0 and iOS 14 from a size perspective using tree maps.</p>

<p>To produce the images in this article, I extracted the root filesystem (including the dyld shared cache) of each major iOS release:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Version</th>
<th>Device</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;14.0 (18A373)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;13.1 (17A844)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;12.0 (16A366)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;11.1 (15B93)</td>
<td>iPhone X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;10.1 (14B72)</td>
<td>iPhone 5s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;9.0 (13A344)</td>
<td>iPhone 5s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;8.0 (12A365)</td>
<td>iPhone 5s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;7.0.1 (11A470a)</td>
<td>iPhone 5s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;6.0 (10A403)</td>
<td>iPhone 3GS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;5.0 (9A334)</td>
<td>iPhone 3GS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iOS&nbsp;4.0 (8A293)</td>
<td>iPhone 3GS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.0 (7A341)</td>
<td>iPhone 3GS</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;2.0 (5A347)</td>
<td>iPhone 2G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 (1A543a)</td>
<td>iPhone 2G</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I then created a tree map. You might be familiar with tree maps as they are often used to visualize a file hierarchy to give you a graphical overview of the structure. One key characteristic is that each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. The tree maps displayed in this article have been created using the awesome <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> and annotated with <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>.</p>

<p>Let's look at what you would see if you could scan iPhone OS 1.0 using X-Rays:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The diagram below highlights some of the major functional blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_structures.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can already notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure is quite simple and has similarities to macOS</li>
<li>Frameworks are taking more than a third of the size</li>
<li>Fonts are taking more than 25% of the whole operating system</li>
</ul>
<p>We can go one level deeper and identify all the components:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS1_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the list of components, we can clearly determine all the main features of iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Clock</li>
<li>Mail</li>
<li>Safari + Web</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Wallpaper</li>
<li>Ringtones</li>
<li>Office support</li>
<li>Audio player</li>
<li>Video player</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of components worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UIKit framework is taking more than 13 % of the total size</li>
<li>The wallpapers and ringtones count for 6 %</li>
<li>ICU (International Components for Unicode) takes more than 5 %</li>
<li>SpringBoard is roughly 2 %</li>
</ul>

<p>On popular demand, I added this section to provide more info about the fonts.
The huge <code>Fonts</code> block is composed of 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fonts representing 2/3 of the size</li>
<li>some caches (visible at the top of the area and representing a third of the size)</li>
</ul>
<p>For the font lovers, here is the complete list of fonts in iPhone OS 1.0:</p>
<pre><code>AmericanTypewriter.ttf
AmericanTypewriterBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensed.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedBold.ttf
AmericanTypewriterCondensedLight.ttf
AmericanTypewriterLight.ttf
Arial.ttf
ArialBold.ttf
ArialBoldItalic.ttf
ArialItalic.ttf
ArialRoundedMTBold.ttf
arialuni.ttf
CourierBoldOblique.ttf
CourierNew.ttf
CourierNewBold.ttf

CourierOblique.ttf
DB_LCD_Temp-Black.ttf
Georgia.ttf
GeorgiaBold.ttf
GeorgiaBoldItalic.ttf
GeorgiaItalic.ttf
Helvetica.ttf

HelveticaOblique.ttf
LockClock.ttf
MarkerFeltThin.ttf

TrebuchetMSBoldItalic.ttf
TrebuchetMSItalic.ttf
Verdana.ttf
VerdanaBold.ttf
VerdanaBoldItalic.ttf
VerdanaItalic.ttf
Zapfino.ttf
</code></pre>
<p>The cache contains info for all these fonts and includes the 2 extra files:</p>
<ul>
<li>HelveLTMM.ps</li>
<li>TimesLTMM.ps</li>
</ul>

<p>I won't give details about each iOS release but you can inspect the tree maps from iPhone OS 2.0 to iOS 13.1:</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the number of building blocks increased with each new iOS release and the components are becoming smaller.</p>

<p>We are now in 2020 and iOS 14 is available. Without a surprise, iOS 14 is way more complex than iPhone OS 1.0:</p>

<p>We can note that the main structure is still fairly similar to the original iPhone OS 1.0 version: the fonts, frameworks, applications, library, /usr, … are still there.</p>
<p>There are however a couple of big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 contains a lot of <code>Preinstalled Assets</code> and <code>Linguistic Data</code>. As far as I can tell, these components are used for on-device machine learning: language detector, voices, tokenizers, vocalizers, …</li>
<li>The dyld shared cache, a caching mechanism introduced in iPhone OS 3.1, causes the Frameworks and Private Frameworks to be split in several areas. The dyld shared cache has been marked with the red box in the diagram.</li>
<li>Health is clearly an important feature of iOS 14.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many components in iOS 14 that it is way more complex to identify all of them. I gave it a try nonetheless:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/iOS14_details.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it is now difficult to list all the features, there are some clear trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 14 is packed with on-device machine learning technologies: Face Detection, Deep Convolutional Networks, Vision frameworks, Text Recognition, Neural Network, …</li>
<li>A lot of components are related to the camera and photos: Effects, Memories, video processing, photo library, …</li>
<li>Siri and voices are clearly visible.</li>
<li>As we already mentioned, Health is an important feature.</li>
<li>We can identify a couple of features added over the years: HomeKit, Watch, CarPlay, Spotlight, Emoji 🤟, News, iWork, Wallet, Shortcuts, ARKit, …</li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are now counting for less than 6 % of the size</li>
<li>Linguistic Data represent almost 8 % of the size</li>
<li>Although the ICU size was multiplied by more than 3 since iPhone OS 1.0, it now represents approximatively 0.5% of the total</li>
</ul>

<p>For readability the previous tree maps in this article were all displayed using the same size. If we present iPhone OS 1.0 next to iOS 14 with a proportional area, you would see that the whole iPhone OS 1.0 is basically taking the size of the iOS 14 wallpapers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1122-comparing-iphone-os-with-ios-14-using-tree-maps/images_article/Compare-iOS1-iOS14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When iPhone OS 1.0 was released in 2007, it redefined the smartphone with a limited set of core features. Nowadays iOS 14 contains an incredible amount of components. By looking at them based on their size, we can determine the most important features. We thus distinctly see Apple's AI push into on-device machine learning with technologies like object detection in images and video, language analysis, sound classification and text recognition.</p>

<p><strong>Update 24.11.2020:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added fonts in the iPhone OS 1.0 tree map</li>
<li>Added fonts in the iOS 14 tree map</li>
<li>Add section with fonts info for iPhone OS 1.0</li>
</ul>

To beat the crisis, the world can't simply rely on renewable energy, governments will need to include carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) into the mix if they want to <span>hit their climate targets.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4uch7"><span>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCUS could <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/transforming-industry-through-ccus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>reduce carbon emissions by almost a fifth</u></a>, but can this technology deliver on its promises or is it too good to be true?</span></p><h3 id="viewer-5vpth"><span>What is <!-- -->Carbon capture, usage and storage?</span></h3><p id="viewer-pi2c"><span>Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) refers to <!-- -->a chain of different technologies aimed at capturing waste <!-- -->carbon dioxide<!-- --> (<!-- -->CO2<!-- -->), usually from large <!-- -->point sources of pollution like power plants, <!-- -->transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere. Some could be used to help grow greenhouse plants, make plastics, or even carbonate fizzy drinks. The first step is to fit factory chimneys with solvent filters, which trap carbon emissions before they escape, then the gas can be piped to locations to be used or stored. For the moment, t<span>here are about 30 CCUS projects operating around the world, which is nowhere near enough to clean up all of our emissions. </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-fds85"><span><span>Why is CCUS needed?</span></span></h3><p id="viewer-7vj3h"><span><span>Nowadays, </span>Industrial production <span>accounts for one-quarter of CO</span>2﻿<span> emissions from energy and industrial processes. With the demand for cement, steel and chemicals remaining strong to support a growing and increasingly urbanised global population, the future production of these materials will have to be more efficient and emit much less CO</span>2<span> if governments want to meet their climate goals.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8ofv8"><span><span>In the </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/material-efficiency-in-clean-energy-transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>IEA's "Clean Technology Scenario"</u></a>, <span>more than 28 GtCO</span>2<span>﻿ could be captured from industrial facilities between now and 2060.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-5eiqn"><span><span>Carbon capture, usage and storage also offers several other potential benefits:</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-63jb1"><p><span>The ability to generate additional power thanks to </span><span>geologically stored CO</span>2 which<span> could be used to extract geothermal heat from the same locations in which it’s injected, producing renewable geothermal energy.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-bcq59"><p><span>CO2 can technically be turned into fuel, although it is rather difficult to achieve.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-dru7v"><p><span>Captured CO</span>2<span> could also be used to strengthen concrete, leading to increased infrastructure durability.</span></p></li></ul><div id="viewer-den6h"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-the-solution-to-the-climate-crisis" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_220f0481ef95495b80fcd23b618197f0~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_853%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f361a8_220f0481ef95495b80fcd23b618197f0~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><h3 id="viewer-e8ds9"><span><span><strong>Suggested Articles:</strong></span></span></h3><ul><li id="viewer-apsbb"><p><strong>🚄 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/hyperloop-the-future-of-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Hyperloop, the future of travel?</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-8crgb"><p><strong>⌚️ </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/fitness-trackers-helping-us-get-fit-or-just-another-gadget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Fitness Trackers: Helping us Get Fit or Just Another Gadget?</u></strong></a></p></li><li id="viewer-4jk2p"><p><strong>📱 </strong><a href="https://www.thedetechtor.com/post/smartphones-the-true-cost-of-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Smartphones: The True Cost of Upgrades</u></strong></a><strong> ♻️ </strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="viewer-9j318"><span>What's the catch?</span></h3><p id="viewer-89c60"><span>CCUS has always been controversial, m<!-- -->ost people are either heavily in favour of CCUS technology or heavily against.
