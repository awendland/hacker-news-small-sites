            <div>
              
              <article>

<p>Let’s open with the controversy: the scripts that live under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> because they are code, <em>not</em> configuration.</p>

<p>This misplacement is something that has bugged me for ages but I never had the energy to open this can of worms back when I was very involved in NetBSD. I suspect it would have been a draining discussion and a very difficult thing to change.</p>

<p>But… what am I talking about anyway?</p>

<p>If you have administered a BSD system, you have certainly encountered the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory; and if you have administered pre-systemd Linux systems, you have dealt with <code>/etc/init.d/</code>. These directories contain startup scripts to configure the system at boot time and are immutable. Their code is parameterized to allow changing their behavior via configuration files, not via code edits. And that’s the base of my critique.</p>

<p>But before getting into why the current state is problematic and how things should look like, let’s first dig into how we got here. And, for that, we need to go back in history.</p>



<p>4.4BSD’s (1993) boot process was rather simple: the kernel started <code>init</code> which in turn ran the <code>/etc/rc</code> script before starting <code>getty</code> on each console. The <code>/etc/rc</code> monolith was in charge of configuring the machine’s file systems and processes, and delegated to two other scripts: <code>/etc/netstart</code> for network configuration and <code>/etc/rc.local</code> for locally-added services. Current BSD systems are more advanced in this area as we shall see later, but the core boot process remains the same: <code>/etc/rc</code> is the primary entry point and bootstraps a collection of shell scripts.</p>

<p>In the early days, package management and file provenance tracking, like we are used to having in popular Linux distributions, was not a thing. You were expected to tune the systems’ behavior by <em>editing</em> files which might or might not have been designed to support edits. If you had to edit <code>/etc/rc</code>, which was a script shipped by the system, that was alright.</p>

<p><code>/etc/rc.local</code>, on the other hard, was <em>not</em> shipped by the system, and it was up to you to create it if you wanted to add custom startup commands without modifying <code>/etc/rc</code>. And this is where things get interesting. <code>/etc/rc.local</code> didn’t need to be supported: if you were expected and able to edit <code>/etc/rc</code> anyway, why would you deal with a separate file? The reason is, most likely, to simplify system upgrades: during an upgrade, you want to benefit from any upstream changes made to <code>/etc/rc</code> (some of which might actually be <em>necessary</em> for proper system operation). Applying updates to a manually-modified file is tricky, so putting as many of your manual overrides into <code>/etc/rc.local</code> helped minimize this problem.</p>



<p>System V 4 (SVR4, 1988) also came with its own, and very different, boot process. The key difference was that System V had the concept of runlevels. As a result, configuring the boot process was a more convoluted endeavour because it was possible to select different services per runlevel.</p>

<p>To accomplish per-runlevel tuning, the system used <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/config-files-vs-directories.html">configuration directories rather than files</a>: there was a separate <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> directory for each runlevel (where <code>X</code> was the number of the runlevel), and these directories contained one file per action to take at startup time. To avoid duplicates, these files were just symlinks to common files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code>—and the symlinks, not their targets, were named so that their lexicographical order determined startup execution order.</p>

<p>Once again, we can already observe issues here: the symlinks under <code>/etc/rcX.d/</code> <em>are</em> configuration because their presence indicates what to start and their names determine their startup order. But the files under <code>/etc/init.d/</code> are <em>not</em>: they are shell scripts shipped with the system and should not be manually modified.</p>



<p>NetBSD <a href="http://www.mewburn.net/luke/papers/rc.d.pdf">modernized the boot process</a> in its 1.5 release (2000), and it did so in two ways: first, it introduced <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> as a directory to contain separate scripts per action and service; and, second, it introduced <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcorder+8+NetBSD-9.0-STABLE">the <code>rcorder(8)</code> tool</a> to determine the order in which these services run. <code>rcorder(8)</code> uses dependency information encoded in the scripts as comments—not lexicographical ordering as System V did. FreeBSD <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rc&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+12.1-RELEASE&amp;arch=default&amp;format=html">inherited this design</a> in its 5.0 release (2003) and OpenBSD reimplemented something similar in its 4.9 release (2011).</p>

<p>With these two pieces in place, the <code>/etc/rc</code> script in NetBSD and FreeBSD changed to execute all files from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> based on the output of <code>rcorder(8)</code>. Among these scripts is <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.d/local"><code>/etc/rc.d/local</code></a>, whose purpose is to run <code>/etc/rc.local</code> if it exists. And that’s all, really. The <code>/etc/rc</code> script thus became <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc">trivial</a>.</p>

<p>The key thing to notice here is that the scripts shipped in <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are <em>highly configurable</em> via the user-controlled <a href="https://github.com/NetBSD/src/blob/8f8c6d6b2a8778b653d9630f3f18e057b477a012/etc/rc.conf"><code>/etc/rc.conf</code></a> file. This essentially makes the scripts read-only, as it shifts local customizations to the configuration file. <em>System administrators are not supposed to edit the scripts.</em> Instead, they are supposed to: modify <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> to customize what gets run and how; add new scripts under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> if they so choose; and edit <code>/etc/rc.local</code> to easily run arbitrary commands.</p>



<p>My main gripe is that the files under <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> are immutable scripts. They do not belong in <code>/etc/</code> and their presence there makes system upgrades harder for no good reason.</p>

<p>You see: in NetBSD and FreeBSD, system upgrades happen by unpacking new distribution sets in the root directory and then running a script to incorporate configuration updates. This script is interactive and helps highlight how new system-provided updates to configuration files conflict with previous manual edits. (This process might seem rudimentary to you, but it’s actually pretty robust and easy to understand—and you can use tooling like <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/sysupgrade/">sysupgrade</a> to make it trivial.)</p>

<p>So why is that a problem? Because you will <em>always</em> face merges like this:</p>

What do you want to do? [Leave it for later]
</code></pre></div>
<p>And, really, who cares? Why are you being distracted to review a <em>code</em> change when what you are trying to do is assess <em>configuration</em> conflicts? How many times have you actually objected to these merges?</p>

<p>You might say: well, I want to know <em>exactly</em> how the boot process of my machine changes during an upgrade. Sure, that’s a fine goal, but then this procedure is flawed and completely insufficient to achieve such goal. In the example above, whatever <code>/etc/rc.d/npf</code> does can also be done from within the <code>/sbin/npfctl</code> binary it invokes… and you were never asked to review changes to the latter during an upgrade, were you? And <em>of course</em> you could review the binary’s code as part of your own system build, but if you did that, then you could have reviewed the startup script as well, right?</p>



<p>Startup scripts provided by the system need to live in a location that can contain executables—but we don’t want those executables to show up in the <code>PATH</code>. These requirements discard <code>bin</code> and <code>sbin</code>, and points us towards <code>libexec</code> on BSD systems and somewhere under <code>lib</code> on Linux.</p>

<p>Therefore, the read-only startup scripts should move from <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> (which, by the way, also applies to <code>/etc/rc</code>, <code>/etc/rc.subr</code>, and <code>/etc/rc.shutdown</code>). And that’s it. <del><code>/etc/rc</code></del> <code>/libexec/rc</code> should continue to use <code>rcorder(8)</code> to check what’s needed to run, but it should read files from <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code>. You might even want to support a separate location for user-created services, which might still be <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> or, better yet, a more fitting location like <code>/usr/pkg/libexec/rc.d/</code> (though that quickly runs into problems if you have multiple file systems).</p>

<p>With this design, system upgrades would be much saner because the configuration merge process would focus, purely, on actual configuration changes and not on irrelevant code changes. All updates to <code>/libexec/rc.d/</code> would be applied by unpacking the new distribution sets (<code>base.txz</code> in this case) without disturbing you about how exactly they changed.</p>

<p>Does this relate to Linux distributions at all? I briefly mentioned <code>/etc/init.d/</code> at the beginning, and the problem there is similar. But it’s also an obsolete problem given that Linux distributions have moved onto systemd by now. That said, systemd still has to manage individual services and, like it or not, has gotten this right. If we look at the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html"><code>systemd.unit(5)</code></a> manual page, which describes where units are loaded from, the system first looks into various <code>/etc/</code> and <code>/run/</code> directories, but then also looks at <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code> (a read-only location correctly controlled by the package manager)—and the vast majority of the scripts live inside the latter.</p>



<p>I currently don’t run BSD systems any more so my incentives to make this happen are low… but if this all makes sense and is something you’d like to pursue, by all means please do! I’m happy to help …</p></article></div></div></div>

					<div><p>As the weeks pass by, the rumors keep spinning, the likelihood of an Nvidia Arm acquisition increases. On first glance, the two businesses look completely incompatible. A highly vertically integrated graphics and AI company with very high margins buying a low margin IP licensor doesn’t make sense. Nvidia can already build any product they wish as an Arm licensee. Purchasing the whole cow doesn’t yield additional milk or synergies from the current business model. Furthermore, given Nvidia’s reputation as a partner, it would likely even cause customers to start looking for contingencies and accelerate RISC-V adoption. Jensen Huang, in his quest for data center dominance, may destroy the Arm ecosystem for everyone else.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1.jpg?resize=1140%2C606&amp;ssl=1" alt="1" width="1140" height="606" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The rational for purchasing Arm seems ridiculous to many, but Jensen’s vision is for the datacenter being a computer and Nvidia being the one to build it. They need to be to be completely vertically integrated and control every aspect of this computer. Currently they have the accelerator market on lock-down with their impressive hardware and vast software moat of CUDA/various SDKs which was built by thousands of Nvidia engineers over the last decade. With the acquisition of Mellanox, they bring the “Data Processing Unit (DPU)” of the data center in house as well. They have also continued to expand their vertically integrated software stack to networking with acquisitions of SwiftStack and Cumulus Networks.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.jpg?resize=1140%2C575&amp;ssl=1" alt="2" width="1140" height="575" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The datacenter is a 3 legged stool, and the remaining missing piece is a CPU. AMD, Intel, and various hyperscalers are also working to build out their own 3-legged stool. The largest threat to Nvidia is Intel/AMD finally having competent GPUs and software stacks to accompany them. With the US Department of Energy dumping money into SYCL and many in the industry congregating around it, the software front is accelerating rapidly. Furthermore, various hyperscalers are rapidly building out their own CPUs with Arm Neoverse IP to hook in with their accelerators such as the Google TPU and Amazon Inferentia for AI workloads. Lastly, these hyperscalers also already have their own custom network stacks. Nvidia is currently in very strong position, but it is very precarious as their moats may all be eroded simultaneously.</p><p>In any business, in order to maintain a high margin over a long period of time, one must create barriers of entry so high, that no one can break in and disrupt. Even though Intel has stopped executing for essentially 5 years, they are still raking in the dough with &gt;55% gross margins. Jensen Huang’s vision, if fully realized, would see Nvidia building a nearly impenetrable moat that commands high margins and locks customers in. This may sound nefarious, but Nvidia’s solution will be plug and play. The vast majority of companies do not have the resources required to build out the entire software stack to match specialized hardware. Nvidia would offer the best solution, which would eventually become an expensive deal imprisoning you in the Devil’s ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.png?resize=1140%2C587&amp;ssl=1" alt="3" width="1140" height="587" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>This is where acquiring Arm rather than licensing her technology comes into play. Nvidia needs to build the moat, and the only way to do this is to effectively hijack the entire open Arm ecosystem. Developing your own CPU ISA is far too large of an investment and there would be no adoption. Even the opening up of Power and MIPS have failed to stop their slow declines to irrelevancy. RISC-V is also still in its infancy and will take many years to move into any verticals besides embedded.</p><p>Jensen can only realize the of the vision of data center dominance by becoming the only company with the trifecta of CPU, GPU, and DPU. Nvidia can only achieve this by acquiring Arm at an unreasonable price. An independent Arm is simply not worth the $35B-$50B which SoftBank wants. Even a $20B valuation would be high valuation for Arm.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.jpg?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="4" width="1140" height="641" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Nvidia can justify this price if they are willing to flip the semiconductor IP world on its head. The ultimate path to ROI means upending the current Arm business model. Given Nvidia’s over $300B valuation, the deal wouldn’t have to be very dilutive to current shareholders. They would start by purchasing the business in a cash/stock deal and obtaining regulatory approval. Regulatory approval initially seems like a large hurdle, but we believe it will not be. The UK will gladly approve if Nvidia makes commitments for large investments. China would be willing to look the other way if the current Arm China JV drama is swept under the rug. The EU would likely need concessions, but because Nvidia does not compete in most of Arm’s verticals, it shouldn’t be too difficult to obtain approval here either. The US regulators would be foaming at the thought of US control of Arm.</p><p>The next step would involve assuring the clients that the businesses would operate separately. Jensen has already begun telegraphing this according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b4649576-9541-4857-b3a4-5b4ccb847642">Financial Times</a>.</p><blockquote><p>As the company extends its reach to supply a complete data centre computing platform, it would sell parts of the technology as separate “layers”, Mr Huang said. Other companies would also be able to license its intellectual property for use in their own chips, rather than needing to buy silicon from Nvidia, he added.</p></blockquote><p>As part of the integration of the two companies, Nvidia would cut or sell the Arm Mali GPU and Ethos NPU business. These would be redundant and can be supplemented with Nvidia’s own expertise. This would be quite the shock as Nvidia’s previous attempts to license their GPU architecture have completely failed. If Nvidia is successful in the renewed licensing efforts, we could live in a world where their CUDA architecture with accompanying software stack (read lock-in) is proliferated across phones, embedded, and the upcoming augmented reality segment. There would be some attrition as companies like Samsung have turned to licensing AMD’s RDNA graphics. In general, it would also accelerate the move out of the Arm ecosystem to RISC-V, but this will be a painful and slow move for most.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5.png?resize=1024%2C395&amp;ssl=1" alt="5" width="1024" height="395" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>The key for Nvidia here is creating captive, dependant customers by rocking the boat, but not too violently. If the NvidiArm solution is convenient and cheap, most of the ecosystem will not attempt to rush out. Nvidia likely does not increase prices for a while in order to give their licensees an illusion of a happy status quo. Eventually, these price increases will come. The attrition will be the worst in the embedded market where RISC-V is mostly already here and players like <a href="https://twitter.com/dylan522p/status/1295500585123188737?s=20">Alibaba</a> and Si-Five have the IP nearly ready to go.</p><p>The mobile SOC market is captive to Arm roadmaps for years to come, and this is one of the sectors Nvidia can start aggressively extracting ROI. Apple has a perpetual license and so they won’t be affected, but Qualcomm, Samsung, and Mediatek would start to sweat bullets as their licensing costs soar and they have no alternatives without their own custom core teams which have been disbanded. Mediatek specifically is highly dependent on not only ARM CPUs, but also GPUs and interconnects for many of their SOCs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6.png?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="6" width="1140" height="641" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Nvidia’s largest avenue for ROI comes the data center. x86 is long overdue for some disruption. Even with AMD innovating rapidly, the world wants more options. Arm server development is being done by multiple hyperscalers and independent fabless vendors. Arm is going to break the x86 monopoly with a combination of licensed Neoverse designs and in-house designs from the likes of Nuvia or Marvell. Once the x86 duopoly is broken, Nvidia can also raise prices rapidly here. &nbsp;The hyperscalers in-house Arm Neoverse designs will still have better TCO than any merchant silicon, but the savings will begin to wane.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7.png?resize=1140%2C641&amp;ssl=1" alt="7" width="1140" height="641" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Another adjacent market where Nvidia can begin to pressure their competition is automotive. While Intel’s Mobileye currently uses MIPS and is transitioning to x86, Tesla and Qualcomm use Arm Cores. If licensing fees ratchet up here significantly, Nvidia can begin to extract margin out of their competitors’ sales. Ultimately, the CPU isn’t a competitive advantage in automotive, but just the cheapest and most convenient option.</p><p>As the Arm ecosystem matures, it will stop being the cheapest option, but only remain the convenient one. Embedded markets have already seen the light of RISC-V and the adoption can only accelerate from here. Other markets have been hooked to the drug of cheap, licensed, Arm IP. With aggressive Nvidia ownership, the junkies will have no choice but to pay up and give in to demands for the short run. They will search for alternative supplies, but this move will take a long time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/semianalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.jpg?resize=1140%2C642&amp;ssl=1" alt="8" width="1140" height="642" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Nvidia’s endgame isn’t more revenue from licensing costs. Their endgame is a fully vertically integrated data center provider. They will want to make and control every part of the three legged stool. This means they slowly destroy the idea of Neoverse. Whether through making that IP extremely costly, or having their own in house designs be a generation ahead, Nvidia will build a moat around Arm server CPUs. Over time, Jensen Huang will muscle out other Arm vendors supplementing them with Nvidia’s in-house designs. The open Arm ecosystem will be hijacked, and be replaced with a closed off ecosystem rivaling or exceeding that of Intel and AMD.</p><p><span>If Nvidia can quickly seize the worlds most important IP, the most commonly used CPU ISA and designs, they will control the destiny of mobile and data center. This is Jensen Huang’s “Trojan Horse” for a Machiavellian takeover of the future of computing.</span></p></div>

<p><a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/07/31/new-mobile-app-help-notify-canadians-potential-covid-19-exposure-now">On July 31st</a>, Canada's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html">COVID Alert</a> app was made available for general use, though it does not have support for actually <em>reporting</em> a diagnosis in most provinces, yet.</p>
<p>In Quebec, we can run the tracing part of the app, and if diagnosis codes become available here, the app can retroactively report contact. It uses the tracing mechanism that <a href="https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing">Google and Apple created together</a>, and in my opinion—at least for now—Canadians should be running this thing to help us all deal with COVID-19. I won't run it forever, but for now, it seems to me that the benefits outweigh the "government can track me" fear (it's not actually tracking you; it doesn't even know who you are), and it's enabled on my phone.</p>
<p>But, before I decided to take this position and offer up my own movement data, I wanted to be sure the app is doing what it says it's doing—at least to the extent of my abilities to be duly diligent. (Note: it's not purely <em>movement</em> data that's shared—at least without more context—but it's actual physical interactions with other people whose phones are available within the radio range of Bluetooth LE.)</p>
<p>Before installing the app on my real daily-carry phone, I decided to put it on an old phone I still have, and to do some analysis on the most basic level of communication: who is it contacting?</p>
<p>In 2015, I gave a <a href="https://prezi.com/iqwzy66rn3uo/inspect-https-with-your-own-man-in-the-middle-non-attacks/">talk</a> at <a href="https://confoo.ca/en">ConFoo</a> entitled "<em>Inspect HTTP(S) with Your Own Man-in-the-Middle Non-Attacks</em>", and this is exactly what I wanted to do here. The tooling has improved in the past 5 years, and firing up <em>mitmproxy</em>, even without ever having used it on this relatively new laptop, was a one-liner, thanks to <a href="https://nixos.org/learn.html">Nix</a>:</p>
<pre><span>nix-shell -p mitmproxy --run mitmproxy</span>
</pre>

<p>This gave me a terminal-based UI and proxy server that I pointed my old phone at (via the Wifi Network settings, under HTTP proxy, pointed to my laptop's local IP address). I needed to have mitmproxy create a Certificate Authority that it could use to generate and sign "trusted" certificates, and then have my phone trust that authority, by visiting <code>http://mitm.it/</code> in mobile Safari, and doing the certificate acceptance dance (this is even more complicated on the latest versions of iOS). Worth noting also, is that certain endpoints such as the Apple App Store appear to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning">Certificate Pinning</a>, so you'll want to do things like install the COVID Alert app from the App Store before turning on the proxy.</p>
<p>Once I was all set up to intercept my own traffic, I visited some <code>https://</code> URLs and saw the request flows in mitmproxy.</p>
<p>I fired up the COVID Alert app again, and noticed something strange… something disturbing:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.scoat.es/covid-tracker-traffic.png" title="COVID Alert app traffic in mitmproxy" alt="shows that the app is accessing clients.google.com"></p>
<p>In addition to the expected traffic to <code>canada.ca</code> (I noticed it's using <code>.alpha.canada.ca</code>, but I suspect that's due to the often-reported unbearably-long bureaucratic hassle in getting a <code>.canada.ca</code> TLS certificate, but that's another story), my phone, when running COVID Alert, was contacting Google.</p>
<pre><span>HEAD https://clients4.google.com/generate_204</span>
</pre>

<p>A little web searching helped me discover that this is a commonly-used endpoint that helps developers determine if the device is behind a "captive portal" (an interaction that requires log-in or payment, or at least acceptance of terms before granting wider access to the Web). I decided that this was <em>probably</em> unintended by the developers of COVID Alert, but it still bothered me that an app, designed for <em>tracking interactions between people['s devices]</em>, that the <em>government</em> wants us to run is telling Google that I'm running it, and disclosing my IP address in doing so:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.scoat.es/covid-alert-google.png" title="A request to clients.google.com, from the COVID Alert app" alt="shows that the User Agent header identifies the app as " covid="" alert="" version=""></p>
<p>(Note that the app clearly identifies itself in the <code>User-Agent</code> header.) </p>
<p>A bit more quick research turned up a <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda-compliance-help/pipeda-interpretation-bulletins/interpretations_02/#fn50-rf">statement by Canada's Privacy Commissioner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address can be considered personal information if it can be associated with an identifiable individual. For example, in one complaint finding, we determined that some of the IP addresses that an internet service provider (ISP) was collecting were personal information because the ISP had the ability to link the IP addresses to its customers through their subscriber IDs.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's not too difficult to imagine that Google <em>probably</em> has enough data on Canadians for this to be a real problem.</p>
<p>I discovered that this app is maintained by the <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/">Canadian Digital Service</a>, and that the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app">source code is on GitHub</a>, but that the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/search?q=clients3.google.com&amp;unscoped_q=clients3.google.com&amp;type=Code">code itself didn't directly contain any references to <code>clients3.google.com</code></a>.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> app, and I figured that the call out to Google must be in one of the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/blob/master/package.json">dependencies</a>, which—considering the norm with JavaScript apps—are pleasantly restrained mostly to React itself. I had no idea which of these libraries was calling out to Google.</p>
<p>Now, I could have run this app on the iOS Simulator (which did I end up doing to test my patches, below), but I thought "let's see what my <em>actual</em> phone is doing." I threw caution to the wind, and I ran <a href="https://checkra.in/">checkra1n</a> on my <em>old</em> phone, which gave me ssh access, which in turn allowed me to copy the app's application bundle to my laptop, where I could do a little more analysis (note the app is bundled as <em>CovidShield</em> because it was previously <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">developed by volunteers at Shopify</a> and was then renamed by CDS (or so I gather, anyway)).</p>
<pre><span>~/De/C/iphone/CovidShield.app ▶ grep -r 'clients3.google.com' *</span>
<span>main.jsbundle:__d(function(g,r,i,a,m,e,d){Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0}),</span>
<span>e.default=void 0;var t={reachabilityUrl:'https://clients3.google.com/generate_204',</span>
<span>reachabilityTest:function(t){return Promise.resolve(204===t.status)},reachabilityShortTimeout:5e3,</span>
<span>reachabilityLongTimeout:6e4,reachabilityRequestTimeout:15e3};e.default=t},708,[]);</span>
</pre>

<p>(Line breaks added for legibility.) Note <code>reachabilityUrl:'https://clients3.google.com/generate_204</code>. Found it! A bit more searching led me to a package called <code>react-native-netinfo</code> (which was directly in the above-linked <code>package.json</code>), and its <a href="https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo/blob/4e3e9813fbae89013bbeee6470b005b6d923e022/src/internal/defaultConfiguration.ts#L2">default configuration</a> that sets the <code>reachabilityUrl</code> to Google.</p>
<p>Now that I knew where it was happening, I could fix it.</p>
<p>To make this work the same way, we needed a reliable <code>204</code> endpoint that the app could hit, and to keep with the expectation that this app should not "leak" data outside of <code>canada.ca</code>, I ended up <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server/pull/241">submitting a patch</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-server">server side code</a> that the app calls. (It turns out that this was not necessary after all, but I'm still glad I added this to my report.)</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/issues/1003">patched</a>, and tested the app code itself via the iOS Simulator.</p>
<p>I then submitted a write-up of what was going wrong and why it's bad, to the main app repository, as <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/issues/1003">cds-snc/covid-alert-app issue 1003</a>, and felt pretty good about my COVID Civic Duty of the day.</p>
<p>The fine folks at the Canadian Digital Service seemed to recognize the problem and agree that it was something that needed to be addressed. A few very professional back-and-forths later (I'll be honest: I barely knew anything about the CDS and I expected some runaround from a government agency like this, and I was pleasantly surprised), we landed on a solution that simply didn't call the reachability URL at all, and they <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-app/releases">released a version of the app</a> that fixed my issue!</p>
<p><img src="https://files.scoat.es/covid-alert-release.jpg" title="COVID Alert release notes showing my fix" alt=""></p>
<p>With the new version loaded, I once again checked the traffic and can confirm that the new version of the app does not reach out to anywhere but <code>.canada.ca</code>.</p>

This is still the looming question, and it’s time to address it. </h3><p id="viewer-9k73p">First, though, imagine that someone in a public forum online asked me, “How much metoprolol (a common blood pressure medication) should I take?” It would be clear that I could not give a real answer. I could give a heavily qualified blanket statement that covered indications and common starting doses, and then recommended speaking with a doctor regarding a personalized dosage. I wouldn’t give a specific dose. But no one would expect me to.  Metoprolol is a medication, and medications are usually prescribed by a physician.</p><p id="viewer-7tpp4">We think of vitamins and supplements differently. A few readers have made comments like this: “I understand that the evidence for Vitamin D in healthy adults doesn’t really show a benefit, but I take Vitamin D because it probably won’t hurt me, and it might help.” This is a common sentiment regarding supplements, but not a statement that most people would make about metoprolol, or any prescribed medication.  Medications are generally understood to be substances taken in response to a specific disease or condition, and we hope that research has shown that they work. Supplements are given a pass; we take them if they might help, even though they may not be needed. </p><p id="viewer-2fbtq"><strong>But Vitamin D should be thought of as a medication</strong>, despite being sold over-the-counter in the supplements aisle. </p><p id="viewer-5549c">To illustrate this, let me introduce Shannon. </p><p id="viewer-518ch">In the fall of 2018, Shannon R. was the special education director for a large Arizona school district. Normally energetic and expressive, the otherwise healthy 38-year-old began having an odd and disturbing symptom: difficulty speaking. Her husband and two boys would ask her questions, and though understanding the question, she was unable to formulate the words to respond. </p><p id="viewer-e7f4v">Milder problems had started over the summer, when she felt more tired than usual. As the months passed, new symptoms appeared: palpitations, insomnia, anxiety, along with cognitive deficits – “like my brain wouldn’t function,” she recalled. Her heart rate, normally in the 60s, now often stayed in the 90s, even while in bed. She barely slept at night and lost nearly 50 pounds. By mid-semester, she was often unable to work. At around 1 AM one October morning, she was taken to the emergency room for a racing heart. When there, she had difficulty responding to the doctors’ and nurses’ questions. After a full workup, the doctors had no explanation, so they resorted to what doctors often reach for when confronted with mystery ailments: psychiatric illness. </p><p id="viewer-fu7id">Shannon would be hospitalized several times for “catatonia,” a general symptom describing difficulty with speaking or moving that is caused by certain psychiatric conditions like depression and schizophrenia. Though she had never exhibited mental illness before, doctors assumed that Shannon had developed a severe psychiatric disorder. </p><p id="viewer-4pb27">Shannon’s husband, as well as her new psychiatrist, doubted this diagnosis, and sought second and third opinions. By the time she contacted me four months later, they had consulted multiple specialists at three different hospitals around the state, but still did not have an explanation for her physical and mental decline. There was something that all of the doctors had noticed, though. Her blood calcium levels were often mildly to moderately elevated above normal, up to 11.1 mg/dl (normal for her age would be up to 10.2 mg/dl). The cause of this was unclear, but her doctors did not believe that this incidental finding was relevant to her current issues, and did not pursue it. <strong>Shannon was not taking calcium supplements at all throughout this time, but her levels were still high.</strong> When she emailed me in February 2019, she was desperate for answers and thought the calcium levels might be a clue. </p><p id="viewer-1miap">My specialty is parathyroid disease, which is the most common cause of high calcium. Based on her parathyroid hormone tests, it did not appear that Shannon had parathyroid disease. But she had high calcium levels, and the rise in those levels correlated with the onset of her symptoms. High calcium levels might initially appear to be a good thing, since we need calcium for our bones. But they are not. High blood calcium levels usually indicate a serious illness.</p><div id="viewer-ep36c"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-2-shannon-s-story?postId=5f39453f8d01fe00170023fe" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_ab9b4f52fab24f4aaf3be163ee13d0ca~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_434,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_ab9b4f52fab24f4aaf3be163ee13d0ca~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5d4om"><em>Calcium is known for its role in bone health, but its role in the brain and nervous system is just as important. Calcium levels need to be within a small range; anything too high or too low can cause problems.

They may develop insomnia and palpitations, a feeling like the heart is racing. Some have more severe neurologic symptoms like muscle weakness and problems with balance, and some have psychiatric symptoms like depression and anxiety. Untreated high calcium can also lead to kidney stones, kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmias, headaches, and gastrointestinal problems. Shannon had some of the classic symptoms, as well as what appeared to be more severe “psychiatric” symptoms. I suspected they were all related to her calcium levels. </p><p id="viewer-bac7q">But why was her calcium high? The parathyroid glands exist to regulate calcium, and they do a very good job at it, keeping blood calcium within a tight range. Usually, a problem with calcium indicates a problem with the parathyroids. But over the last few years I have had more patients coming to me with high calcium related to something else: Vitamin D. </p><p id="viewer-6d1js"><strong>Vitamin D is a steroid hormone</strong>, in the same category as sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and glucocorticoids like the stress hormone cortisol. Steroid hormones are all made from cholesterol, and looking at their molecular structures, you can see the similarities. </p><div id="viewer-6s0p9"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-2-shannon-s-story?postId=5f39453f8d01fe00170023fe" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1ef7e9201aae4b54be7b21f6f218627e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1586,h_972,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1ef7e9201aae4b54be7b21f6f218627e~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-3upia">Like the other steroid hormones, Vitamin D acts on multiple organs and only tiny amounts of the molecule are required to have substantial effects. Anyone who has gone through puberty understands the impressive physiologic changes brought about by relatively small shifts in hormone levels. Not surprisingly, most steroid hormones are considered medications that require a physician's order. Vitamin D is an exception. In the U.S., high dose Vitamin D can be purchased by anyone, without a prescription, in most drugstores and grocery stores. It is called a dietary supplement, which sounds safer than a medication, but this is misleading. Due to its role in calcium absorption, high dose Vitamin D can cause serious problems. </p><p id="viewer-21t00">Eventually we worked out what happened with Shannon: In 2013 she was diagnosed with mild osteopenia, a thinning of the bones that can be a precursor to osteoporosis. Her Vitamin D was low at the time, so her physician started her on over-the-counter Vitamin D supplementation at 5000 international units (IUs) daily. Five years later, she was still on this dose, and her blood Vitamin D level had risen to 79 ng/ml. This level is within what many labs call the normal range, between 30 and 100 ng/ml, but levels above 70 are almost always a result of high dose supplementation, and I have seen toxicity with levels between 70 and 100 ng/ml. (A better “normal range” based on what I have seen would probably be between 30 and 60.) Vitamin D builds up over time, so the longer someone is on a high dose, the more likely she is to develop toxicity. Shannon’s calcium levels began rising in the fall of 2018, when her severe symptoms developed. </p><p id="viewer-c0tav">Ironically, Shannon started to recover because she became too sick to worry about taking her vitamins, and stopped taking Vitamin D in October. It often takes many months for high Vitamin D levels to drop, and it took six months for Shannon’s level to fall into the 50s. As it fell, her calcium level gradually started to normalize, and her symptoms slowly resolved. By May, she was starting to feel like herself again. </p><p id="viewer-208hf">I spoke with Shannon recently. All of the symptoms that characterized her frightening and rapid decline in health had resolved completely. Listening to this animated woman, it was difficult to imagine her unable to talk. The only lingering effects appeared to be a wariness of physicians and distrust of vitamins, both understandable. Shannon agrees that Vitamin D should be treated like a medication. “It’s a hormone!” she exclaimed. “If I had to take ‘Hormone D’, I would have questioned my doctor about why I needed it.” Shannon is now committed to educating others about Vitamin D. </p><p id="viewer-16oc8">Of course, there is a selection bias in who comes to me. There are people out there doing just fine on 5000 units of Vitamin D daily. I only see the ones who develop high calcium levels. But I see enough of them to know that this is not an exceptionally rare occurrence. I have been to lectures in which physicians have claimed that Vitamin D toxicity almost never occurs. In my experience, this is false. I have seen many cases of Vitamin D toxicity in people who were taking the recommended dose from an over-the-counter bottle.</p><p id="viewer-8pgar">Unfortunately, none of those patients were warned about the potential for Vitamin D to cause high calcium. They all believed that they were taking a supplement to improve health and that there was very little risk. Supplements don’t require prescriptions, and most do not have the warning labels that accompany medications.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="skip-nav"><p><time>23.08.2020</time> — <a href="https://www.tiffanymatthe.com/tags/mindset">Mindset</a> — <span>2<!-- --> min read</span></p><section><img src="https://www.tiffanymatthe.com/static/c239dad4f9476bf8d02961e957aa71cf/a6c62/rock-climbing.jpg"><p>The internet always highlights the first place winners, the billionaires, the award-winning artists, the best-selling authors, the largest philanthropists, the extraordinary. Their stories are ones of success, of inspiration. They show us what is possible, and push us to achieve more.</p><p>But I don't feel inspired when I see extraordinary. I feel disappointed, jealous. My constant exposure to these amazing stories of success has normalized the extraordinary. I started comparing myself to these "normal" extraordinary people, and wondered why I was not them. This disappointment would incite me to take action, but after a few days of hard work, I would just quit. Quitting was easier; it helped me avoid thinking about the extraordinary and the negative dark clouds that I had shrouded it with.</p><p>This mentality was self-defeating. No one starts off as extraordinary, so that meant I quit a lot in the past. Over time, I came to realize two things:</p><ol><li>extraordinary as I perceived it was one-dimensional and unrealistic,</li><li>to improve, extraordinary could not be my end goal.</li></ol><p><strong>We need to redefine extraordinary.</strong> Extraordinary is often defined by the internet as a permanent trait someone has. They seemed to have been born with it, and extraordinary permeates their every pore. </p><p>But real extraordinary is nothing like this. Yes, it's exciting, but it also comes with sacrifices, limitations, and constraints. And it's not permanent. Extraordinary can disappear over time, just like you can achieve it over time.</p><p>Extraordinary also comes in many forms, and its value does not have to be measured in terms of money. You can be a tech giant who built their entire empire from scratch, just as you can be an amazing organizer who rallies entire communities together for a single cause. You can be a top-notch violinist player, or a inspiring storyteller. Extraordinary can be anything. Sometimes, when you realize what extraordinary really entails, you might not even want it. That's okay.</p><p><strong>Extraordinary should not be the end goal.</strong> I like to envision the extraordinary space in society as a small ledge at the top of a cliff. It gives you a beautiful view and a sense of accomplishment, but is also tight and oppressing. The sheer physical constraints means that not everyone will reach it. But that shouldn't stop you from putting a hand on the cliff and lifting yourself towards that ledge.</p><p>Why? Because the ledge is not the only thing that exists. There is a vast amount of space under it, other ledges, crooks, and crannies, that most people forget about. That space is just as valuable.</p><p>For example, someone starting out on Youtube might be disappointed that they don't have millions of subscribers. They don't think they have what it takes, so they quit. But most people don't only look at the channels with millions of subscribers. Smaller ones are as valuable for viewers, and the creators can get just as much value out of creating their original content and connecting with like-minded people.</p><p>So instead of searching for an extraordinary that is distorted and unrealistic, search to climb up to some space beneath the top ledge. You will be less disappointed and jealous, and you will still maintain some velocity in the right direction. Climbing to a higher vantage point can also unlock new forms of extraordinary that you might have never noticed before.</p><p>By consistently climbing and reassessing which direction to take, you might just reach your own extraordinary as a bonus.</p></section></div></div>]]>

  <p>Bishop Peder Winstrup of Lund, Sweden passed away in the winter of 1679 at the age of 74 and was interred in a crypt at Lund Cathedral. Three centuries later, his astonishingly well-preserved remains provide insights to the origins of tuberculosis.</p>
  

  

  <p>In a recent study published in <em>Genome Biology</em>, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Lund University and the Swedish Natural Historical Museum present analysis of the highest quality ancient Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome to date, suggesting the pathogen is much younger than previously believed.</p>

<p>When Anthropologist Caroline Arcini and her colleagues at the Swedish Natural Historical Museum discovered small calcifications in the extremely well preserved lungs of Bishop Peder Winstrup, they knew more investigation was needed. “We suspected these were remnants of a past lung infection,” says Arcini, “and tuberculosis was at the top of our list of candidates. DNA analysis was the best way to prove it.”</p>
<p>Up to one quarter of the world’s population is suspected to have been exposed to bacteria of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex, which cause tuberculosis (TB). Bishop Winstrup would have been one of many to fall ill during the onset of the so-called “White Plague” TB pandemic that ravaged post-medieval Europe. Today, TB is among the most prevalent diseases, accounting for the highest worldwide mortality from a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>The global distribution of TB has led to the prevailing assumption that the pathogen evolved early in human history and reached its global distribution via the hallmark Out of Africa human migrations tens of thousands of years ago, but recent work on ancient TB genomes has stirred up controversy over when this host-pathogen relationship began. In 2014, a team led by scientists from the University of Tübingen and Arizona State University reconstructed three ancient TB genomes from pre-contact South America – not only were the ancient strains unexpectedly related to those circulating in present-day seals, but comparison against a large number of human strains suggested that TB emerged within the last 6000 years. Understandably, skepticism surrounded this new estimate since it was based entirely on ancient genomes that are not representative of the TB strains associated with humans today.</p>
<p>“Discovery of the Bishop’s lung calcification gave us the opportunity to revisit the question of tuberculosis emergence with data from an ancient European,” comments Kirsten Bos, group leader for Molecular Paleopathology at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History (MPI-SHH), who co-led the study. “If we could reconstruct a TB genome from Bishop Winstrup, where we know his date of death to the day, it would give a secure and independent calibration for our estimates of how old TB, as we know it, actually is.”</p>
<p><b>The highest quality ancient TB genome to date&nbsp; </b></p>
<p>In a new study published this week in Genome Biology, Susanna Sabin of MPI-SHH and colleagues reconstruct a tuberculosis genome from the calcified nodule discovered in Bishop Winstrup's remains.</p>
<p>“The genome is of incredible quality – preservation on this scale is extremely rare in ancient DNA,” comments Bos.</p>

<p>Together with a handful of tuberculosis genomes from other work, the researchers revisit the question of the age of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, with the year of the Bishop’s death as a fine-tuned calibration point. Using multiple molecular dating models, all angles indeed point to a relatively young age of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex.</p>
<p>“A more recent emergence of the tuberculosis pathogen complex is now supported by genetic evidence from multiple geographic regions and time periods,” comments Sabin, first author of the study. “It’s the strongest evidence available to date for this emergence having been a Neolithic phenomenon.”</p>
<p>This most recent shift in the narrative for when bacteria in the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>complex became highly infectious to humans raises further questions about the context of its emergence, as it appears to have coincided with the rise of pastoralism and sedentary lifestyles.</p>
<p>“The Neolithic transition seems to have played an important role for the emergence of a number of human pathogens,” comments Denise Kühnert, group leader for disease transmission research at MPI-SHH who co-led the investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For TB in particular, stronger evidence could only come from an older genome, though these deeper time periods are unlikely to yield preservation on the scale of what we’ve seen for Bishop Winstrup,” adds Bos.</p>
<p>“Moving forward,” Sabin further comments, “the hope is we will find adequately preserved DNA from time periods close to the emergence of the complex, or perhaps from its ancestor.”</p>

There’s </p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank">Slack</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a></li><li><a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank">GSuite Marketplace</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a></li><li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/ios/app-store/" target="_blank">Apple iOS App Store</a></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/genre/mac/id39?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a></li></ul><p>All these marketplaces are valid options for you to start. I would lean on a marketplace where there’s a combination of 2 factors</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Familiarity with problems</strong> - You know what the core product is about, you understand or can empathise with its users maybe from using the tool at your previous workplace, you have an idea on the different kind of problems that exist in the ecosystem and don’t find it too boring to solve them</li><li><strong>Skillset to execute</strong> - If you don’t know how to build Android, iOS, or Mac apps, perhaps steer clear of it. Your goal is not to take on a hard challenge, it’s to take on a challenge where you have some advantage from skill and insight. The goal is to win.<br></li></ol><h3>Why you should pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Huge distribution:</strong> Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it. Shopify has 1mn+ merchants and tons of new signups every month who go to the app store browsing for solutions. <br>Shopify promotes apps within its product and has made it an integral part of its user journey. A new app is able to gain traction fairly easily in the app marketplace, which makes it friendly to newcomers. <br>Marketing is often a big reason for a business’s failure, the App Store takes care of it.</li><li><strong>Tons of app opportunities:</strong> E-commerce store owners have 101+ problems to be taken care of, and you can address any one and do a great job at it to build a sustainable business. It’s not hard (relative standards) to gain 200 paying customers paying you $10/mo to earn $2000/mo ($1600 after Shopify’s 20%)</li><li><strong>Ease of development:</strong> Shopify’s documentation and APIs are first-class, they get out of the way allowing you to build fast. Additionally, Shopify’s <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris UI framework</a> makes building app interfaces a piece of cake. It’s based on React and comes with a Sketch/Figma file to help you design and prototype solutions fast.</li><li><strong>Billing taken care of:</strong> Heads up, Shopify takes a 20% commission on all earnings. So if your app’s monthly subscription fees is $10, you get $8. In return, Shopify takes care of billing end to end.<br>You can charge monthly, annually, charge per activity, provide app credit, and issue refunds with very little effort. You don’t need to worry about failed payments, Shopify takes care of it. You don’t even need to generate an invoice, app bills are included in the merchant’s monthly Shopify invoice.</li><li><strong>Familiarity with ecommerce:</strong> If you’re someone who can jump into an industry and learn all about it, great. If not, you would want some familiarity with how an ecommerce store works, what are the typical problems faced by a merchant.<br>You can do this by creating a Shopify store and trying to sell your own products. Or you could have conversations with 10 different store owners and absorb from their experience. You could also find someone who works at an e-commerce agency for valuable insights. It’s not that hard.<br></li></ul><h3>Why you shouldn’t pick the Shopify app marketplace:</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Copycat galore:</strong> You’re likely to copy an existing app and make a slight improvement in terms of product, pricing, or both. Guess what, the next smart person with the same idea can do the same to you. If you’re dependent on getting all or majority of your customers from the app store, be ready for stiff competition from copycats. <br>This doesn’t mean you cannot grow your app to $1k or $10k MRR. SaaS is not a winner take all market. It just means that it gets harder to grow as you grow. If this is something you are not mentally prepared for, steer clear. <br>There’s ways you can grow out of this by taking a long term strategy, either by taking a brand-centric approach (brand is not your name, but the experience that customers remember you by for which they’ll choose you over a copycat). <br>Or you can go upmarket and target large volume and Plus merchants, where ticket sizes are $200/mo or higher and switching does not happen often. </li><li><strong>Low-end, high-maintenance customers:</strong> Majority of Shopify merchants are people who don’t want to pay beyond $10-$15/mo and yet they expect world-class customer service. Some will ask for phone support or to jump on a video call. <br>You can tackle this by solving problems where the ticket sizes are higher, in the range of $50-$100/mo, but also expect it to be significantly harder to rank and fight existing competitors in such problem spaces. Example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=page+builder" target="_blank">page builders</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product+reviews" target="_blank">product review</a> apps. <br>You can mitigate this by going in with the mindset that you’ll be serving $15/mo customers, so your app better be self-serve ready, have a dead simple UX and sufficient documentation or walkthrough videos. You can also aim to be the cost-leader of a segment, example - <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme" target="_blank">Judge.me</a> </li></ul><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>Discover problems, niches, and Shopify app ideas</strong></h2><p>I’ve previously written about <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/shopify-micro-saas-growth" target="_blank">uncovering opportunities on Shopify</a> and I also shared all my research in my big <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hnpcl1VAlPC9MuFvvsl2UsU0yu1iM6aKR-iK30VtbwA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Shopify app ideas spreadsheet</a>. Let me reiterate on the advice shared there in a more structured manner that will hopefully better answer questions like:</p><ul role="list"><li>“How do you find niches in the app store in the first place?”</li><li>“How to find a problem worth solving within shopify? (worth solving=stressful enough for merchants &amp; competition not too tough)”<br></li></ul><p>There have been people who have asked me what kind of problems to solve, or what are the underserved niches. The thing is - if there's an obviously underserved niche and people have taken the time to research about it, they are probably busy solving it. If it's being posted in any blog post, know that it's no longer an underserved or hidden niche, because clearly anyone could find it.</p><p>Ultimately, only you can find an idea that you find worthy enough to pursue, whose various pros and cons are justified in your mind. And therefore, I can only provide a directional framework towards evaluating ideas. I can't list out ideas.</p><p>The best use of a directional framework is to</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>First</strong> - cast a wide net, get to know what's out there</li><li><strong>Second</strong> - narrow down your search based on parameters you have decided</li></ol><p>This first section of the article will help you with casting a wide net. </p><p>As you go further along the article, I've shared ideas and techniques which you can use to narrow down your search.<br></p><h3>1- Browse the entire App Store</h3><p>I recommend this as the starting point for anyone new to the Shopify ecosystem. Start by browsing all the categories &amp; sub-categories of apps on the app store. You can do the same on <a href="https://sasi.unionworks.co.uk/categories" target="_blank">SASI</a>. </p><p>The purpose of browsing this way is to familiarise yourself with the different types of problems faced by merchants and being solved by apps. Ideally, you want to note down some interesting apps that you come across during your browsing adventure to investigate later on.</p><figure id="w-node-892fc283544a-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f1c114edd643e073591f8cc_browse%20categories%20shopify%20app%20store.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2- Go through every letter in search autocomplete</h3><p>Okay, this is a step I took when&nbsp;I was browsing the app store. I would type in "aa", "ab", "ac"... ... ... "zz" on the search bar, note the autocomplete terms and check the results of ones I found to be interesting.</p><p>Turns out, Shopify has since updated their algorithm. Autocomplete suggestions only show up after you type 3 letters now. So you can't recreate what I did with autocomplete and go through every letter. It's not feasible anymore.</p><p>Not to worry, it's still useful.</p><h4>Plug in keywords of shortlisted apps into the search bar</h4><p>From step 1, all the apps (hopefully at least a dozen) that you shortlisted for being interesting, extract the keywords used in the app's title or description. </p><p>Now, enter those keywords in search to find whether they …</p></div></div>

      <p>Hard to imagine that it’s already been a year since Nu first went public. At the time, it was largely a demo of what could be possible, but still needed quite a bit of work to make it ready for everyday use. A year later and we’ve learned a lot, and made a few mistakes along the way. In this post, we look back over the year and see how we did and where we might be going in the future.</p>



<p>When Nu first started, it started with a simple idea: the output of <code>ls</code>, <code>ps</code>, and <code>sysinfo</code> should all output the same thing. Taking a page from PowerShell, we explored outputting structured data and quickly settled on a table design that would support the output of each of the three commands, with the added ability of streaming the output as it became available.</p>

<p>Around this idea, we then built a set of “filters”, like the <code>where</code> clause, borrowed from SQL, and a growing set of data types we would support natively.  Soon, we were able to write more complex statements like <code>ls | where size &gt; 10kb</code>. This became the crux of the idea - commands that output values from a core set of data types into a stream, composed together with the traditional UNIX pipe (<code>|</code>), so that you could build up a complex set of commands that work over the data as it streams through.</p>

<p>Nushell is an interactive programming language for working with your files, your system, and your data as a shell, a notebook, and more.</p>

<h2 id="nu-is-more-than-a-shell">Nu is more than a shell</h2>

<p>It’s easy to think of Nushell as just a shell. It’s even got ‘shell’ in the name. It’s the first and probably main way you’ll interact with it. So why say it’s “more than a shell”?</p>

<p>In truth, Nushell is actually two things at once: Nu and Nushell. Nu is an interactive language for processing streams of structured data, data that you’re probably getting from files, your system, a web address, etc.</p>

<p>So what’s Nushell?</p>

<p>Nushell is taking the Nu language and putting it into a shell, and building around it a set of shell features to make it feel comfortable to use as a login shell. Completions, pretty error messages, and the like.</p>

<p>When we say that “Nu is more than a shell”, does that imply that Nu can be used in other places, too? Absolutely. We’ve got two more hosts that let you run Nu, a <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nu_jupyter">jupyter-based</a> host that lets you run Nu in jupyter notebooks, and a <a href="https://github.com/nushell/demo">WebAssembly-based</a> host that we use to create the <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/demo/">Nu playground</a></p>

<p>The idea of Nu runs deeper than just the shell, to being a language that’s relatively easy to learn, yet powerful enough to do real work with your system, to process large amounts of data, to interactively let you iterate quickly on an idea, to invite exploration by building up a pipeline one piece at a time. There’s really no shortage of ambition for where we hope to go.</p>



<p>Nu’s original design has proven surprisingly robust thus far. Some of its core ideas are continuing to pay dividends a year later. Let’s look at the designs that still feel right.</p>

<h2 id="pipelines-are-infinite">Pipelines are infinite</h2>

<p>When we first started writing Nu, we took a few shortcuts that had us processing all the data in a pipeline at once. Very quickly, we realize this wasn’t going to work. External commands (think <code>cat /dev/random</code>) can output an infinite stream of data, and the system needs to be able to handle it. Understanding this, we transitioned to a different model: data flows between command as infinite streams of structured data. As the data is processed, we avoid collecting the data whenever possible to allow this streaming to happen.</p>

<p>Because the streams can be infinite, even the printing out of tables is done a batch at a time.</p>

<h2 id="separating-viewing-data-from-the-data-itself">Separating viewing data from the data itself</h2>

<p>Coming from other shells, the idea of running <code>echo</code> or <code>ls</code> goes hand-in-hand with printing something to the terminal. It’s difficult to see that there two steps going on behind the scenes: creating the information and then displaying it to the screen.</p>

<p>In Nu, these two steps are distinct. The <code>echo</code> command gets data ready to output into stream, but doesn’t do any work to print it to the screen. Likewise, <code>ls</code> gets ready to output a stream of file and directory entries, but doesn’t actually display this information.</p>

<p>That’s because both <code>echo</code> and <code>ls</code> are lazy commands. They’ll only do the work if the data is pulled from the stream. As a result, the step of viewing the data is separate from the step of creating it.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Nu converts a standalone <code>ls</code> to be the pipeline <code>ls | autoview</code>. The work of viewing comes from <code>autoview</code> and it handles working with the data and calling the proper viewer. In this way, we’re able to keep things as structured data for as long as possible, and only convert it to be displayed as the final step before being shown to the user. (note: the wasm-based demo and jupyter do a similar step, but instead of adding <code>autoview</code>, they add <code>to html</code>)</p>

<h2 id="rich-data-types">Rich data types</h2>

<p>In a similar way to working with structured data, rather than only plain text, Nu takes a different approach to data types as well. Nu takes the traditional set of basic types, like strings and numbers, and extends them into a richer set of basic data primitives.</p>

<p>Numbers are represented internally as big numbers and big decimals, rather than integers and floating point machine-based representations. This gives us more flexibility to do math more accurately, and generally removes the worry of whether the number you want to work with will fit in the integer or float size you have available.</p>

<p>We carry this further, by also representing values common in modern computer usage: URLs, file paths, file sizes, durations, and dates are all examples of built-in data types. By building them in, Nu can have better syntax and type checking with their use.</p>

<p>For example, in Nu it’s possible to write <code>= 1min + 1sec</code> to create a duration that is one minute one second long.  You can also use the file sizes, like being able to filter a directory list by the size of the file <code>ls | where size &gt; 10kb</code>.</p>

<p>Nu also can help if you try to mix types that shouldn’t. For example, if you had written: <code>= 1min + 1kb</code> it seems you didn’t mean to add time and file sizes together, and Nu gives you an error if you do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error: Coercion error
  ┌─ shell:1:3
  │
1 │ = 1min + 1kb
  │   ^^^^   --- filesize(in bytes)
  │   │       
  │   duration
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>note: we’ll be making this error better in the future</em></p>

<p>Data in Nu also isn’t just the value, but it’s also a set of metadata that comes with the value. For example, if you load data from a file using the <code>open</code> command, we track the place that it’s loaded along with the data that’s loaded. We can see this metadata using the <code>tags</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>open package.json | tags
───┬─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 # │      span       │                                    anchor                                    
───┼─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 0 │ [row end start] │ /home/jonathan/Source/servo/tests/wpt/web-platform-tests/webrtc/tools/packag 
   │                 │ e.json                                                                       
───┴─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This extra information allows us to know how to view the contents, and even save you time when you use the <code>save</code> command, as it will use the original location by default.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-fun">Keeping it fun</h2>

<p>Something we attached to early on was the idea that Nu should be fun. It should be fun to work on, it should be fun to contribute to, and it should be fun to use.</p>

<p>Nu is really about play. You play with your data, you play with the structures that make up your files and filesystem, you play with what web services give back to you. Everything about Nu is made to invite you to explore how things work and how data is put together. As you play, you learn more about Nu works and how to better use it. We firmly believe …</p></section></div></div>

    <p>Using Generators to Modernize a Geriatric Javascript API for <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<hr>
<p>How do you find-and-replace text on an HTML page?</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;div&gt;</span><span>Hello, </span><span>&lt;span&gt;</span><span>human</span><span>&lt;/span&gt;</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>If the text is neatly neatly isolated inside an HTML element, it's easy; this will do:</p>
<pre><code><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"span"</span><span>)</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>"evolved ape"</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>But here's a puzzle</strong>: how do you you change text that <em>isn't</em> neatly isolated in an HTML element?</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> use <code>innerHTML</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>elt </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML </span><span>= </span><span>elt</span><span>.innerHTML.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>...but this will hose any event listeners registered on <code>elt</code>'s children.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> grapple onto the nearest selectable element:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"div"</span><span>)</span><span>.childNodes[</span><span>0</span><span>];
</span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yuck; this sort of child-node indexing feels <em>really</em> brittle.</p>
<p><strong>Why can't we just <em>directly</em> select the text nodes containing <code>Hello</code>?</strong></p>
<h2 id="xpath">XPath</h2>
<p><strong>We can!</strong> Enter: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath">XPath</a>, the <em>excessively</em> powerful language for querying XML documents. It's usable in web-browsers with the, uh, <em>descriptively</em>-named method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/evaluate"><code>document.evaluate</code></a>.</p>
<p>It's a <em>bit</em> of a production to use:</p>
<pre><code><span>let </span><span>xpath </span><span>= </span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>; </span><span>// find text nodes containing 'Hello'
</span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.body; </span><span>// look in the body element
</span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>; </span><span>// some sorta xml voodoo
</span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE; </span><span>// DEFINITELY MAKE SURE YOU USE THIS

</span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>) {
  </span><span>let </span><span>node </span><span>= </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>)</span><span>;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Yes, you really need to write <em>all</em> of that. The <code>result_type</code> argument is technically optional, but omit it at your own peril: without it, you must instead stream results via <code>iterateNext</code>, and this will crash with an exception if you dare <em>modify</em> the queried elements!</p>
<p>It's no wonder <code>document.evaluate</code> is seldom used. <strong>Can we improve on it?</strong></p>
<h2 id="iterizing-xpath-queries">Iterizing XPath Queries</h2>
<p>Yes, with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators"><strong>generators</strong></a>! We can exploit the implicit iterability of generators to modernize this unwieldy API:</p>
<pre><code><span>Document</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.xpath </span><span>= </span><span>Element</span><span>.</span><span>prototype</span><span>.</span><span>xpath </span><span>=
  </span><span>function* </span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>) {
    </span><span>let </span><span>context </span><span>= </span><span>this </span><span>instanceof </span><span>Document </span><span>? </span><span>document</span><span>.documentElement </span><span>: </span><span>this</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>namespace_resolver </span><span>= </span><span>null</span><span>;
    </span><span>let </span><span>result_type </span><span>= </span><span>XPathResult</span><span>.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE;
    </span><span>let </span><span>results </span><span>= </span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>evaluate</span><span>(</span><span>xpath</span><span>, </span><span>context</span><span>, </span><span>null</span><span>, </span><span>result_type</span><span>)</span><span>;

    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>i </span><span>= </span><span>0</span><span>; </span><span>i </span><span>&lt; </span><span>results</span><span>.snapshotLength; </span><span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)
      </span><span>yield </span><span>results</span><span>.</span><span>snapshotItem</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span>;
  };
</span></code></pre>
<p>And because the result of this function is iterable, we can use it with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spread syntax</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>...</span><span>document</span><span>.</span><span>xpath</span><span>(</span><span>"//text()[contains(., 'Hello')]"</span><span>)</span><span>].
  </span><span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>node </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent </span><span>= </span><span>node</span><span>.textContent.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello"</span><span>, </span><span>"Greetings"</span><span>))</span><span>;

                        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">Pieter Levels </a>makes about $600,000 a year. He taught himself to code and has an unconventional philosophy. This is not an interview but an analysis piece. Pieter defied the critics and built Nomad List and Remote OK into successful businesses without cutting edge tools like React or other modern frameworks. I send articles like this twice a week - <a href="https://nocsdegree.carrd.co/">join 2,000 developers that get the newsletter</a>.</p><h2 id="who-is-pieter-levels">Who is Pieter Levels</h2><p>Pieter is a self-taught developer from The Netherlands. He has an MBA but no coding qualifications. As we will see in today's article he has a rough and ready approach to coding but it pays off handsomely. </p><p>His <a href="https://www.nomadlist.com/">Nomad List</a> directory and community for digital nomads draws in over $300k a year and that's despite a recent fall in revenue due to people not travelling during the Corona virus crisis. </p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-23.30.06.png" alt=""></figure><p>His Remote Ok job board for remote workers made <a href="https://remoteok.io/open">$300,000 over the last 12 months</a></p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-14-at-23.23.51.png" alt="Revenue chart for Remote OK job board"></figure><p>So that's a total of $600,00 from the last 12 months! Not bad for a self-taught developer! Pieter is active on Twitter and has a very stong following there. </p><p>As he works for himself he is able to travel extensively and live where he choses. Although, rather than the common misconception of digital nomads being constantly on the move, Pieter recommends spending a few months in each place. This way you avoid travel burnout. </p><h2 id="how-did-pieter-levels-learn-to-code">How did Pieter Levels learn to code?</h2><p>Not a lot is known about his very earlies forays into coding apart from the fact that as a teenager he played around programming. His first attempt at a web business was an analytics service for Youtube which would let you see how all your videos/channels were performing in one place. Unfortunately, he worked on it for a year without making any money from it. </p><p>From that point Pieter adopted his now familar approach to coding and business - build websites quickly and monetize from the beginning. He only adds more features if there is money coming in and the idea is validated by the market.</p><p>Pieter takes the "search on Google" approach to Google. So when he wanted to connect a database to a website or make a button do something on his website he would just search the terms on Google and find solutions in places like Stackoverflow. Pieter is a strong critic of the approach of doing courses as he believes people learn best by doing and building. </p><p>One analogy would be different approaches to learning Spanish. One person might study a course, learn the correct grammar and then go to Spain. Whereas Pieter would go to Spain, ask for the words he needs to use and go from there. </p><p>When asked in the past why he didn't use modern frameworks like React he made the point that as he was a solo founder he couldn't afford to spend time re-building his websites as this would mean his project would stall. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://gum.co/GGofo"><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/08/monetize.png" alt="monetize"></a></p>

There is no such thing as Vanilla JS though. It's just plain-old Javascript without a framework such as React, Vue or Angular) </li><li>jQuery (An unfashionable choice nowadays but it does the job)</li><li>PHP (He doesn't use any frameworks like Laravel)</li><li>SQLite - Pieter says it's super quick and swears by it.

He "built in public" - that is to say he gave daily updates of his code on Twitter. This is also a great way for developers to build an audience! You can check out what people are saying about Remote Workers on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/remote-workers">Product Hunt</a>. </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Pieter is like a bare knuckle boxer so don't compare him to a Judo practioner going to the Olympics. One is going to win no matter what and one is going to follow the rules they have trained under and have finer technique. Neither is better or worse. It depends on the situation. </p><p>Pieter's approach would not be good if you were trying to get a job in a lot of companies. But Pieter isn't looking for a job and the proof for him is in his bank balance. So Pieter's scrappy technique is better suited if you are attracted to coding for entrepreneurship and being a solo founder who doesn't have to share their code with others to work on. He doesn't use Github to save his code, for instance and this is an industry standard that most employers expect. If you want to be an indie hacker/entrepreneur though then Pieter is a fine act to follow. </p><h3 id="if-you-enjoyed-this-article-please-send-it-to-a-friend">If you enjoyed this article please send it to a friend </h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="and-you-should-totally-sign-up-for-the-newsletter">And you should totally <a href="https://nocsdegree.carrd.co/">sign up for the newsletter</a> </h3>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Back in 2011, I happened to get a job writing <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> app. If you never did that, don’t. I was complaining about difficulties with composition left and right to whoever would listen. As I started digging into alternatives for the front-end, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming">FRP</a> and <a href="https://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax</a>, and <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>. The last one got me hooked on <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I even did a <a href="https://fwdays.com/event/js-frameworks-day-2013/review/Functional-Reactive-Programming-&amp;-ClojureScript">successful talk</a> on FRP and ClojureScript (and precursor to <a href="https://hoplon.io/">Hoplon</a>, called hlisp).</p>
<h2 id="react">React</h2>
<p>Then in May 2013 React was released. I championed it on my new job and discovered during Clojure-themed hackaton (<a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2013/clojurecup/">Clojure Cup 2013</a>) that CLJS and React are a great match. What’s so good about React though? To me, the main selling point is that it composes well.</p>
<p>When you use predecessors like jQuery or Backbone or Angular or whatever after just a year of development your code is a mess of event listeners and triggers. Don’t get me started on unobtrusive JS, code locality is non-existent with jQuery. Which handler is bound where and what it does? It’s too hard to discover to be a good base for a good codebase!</p>
<p>Then I started working at <a href="https://kasta.ua/">Kasta</a>, where web frontend was exactly that jQuery-ish mess. Nobody ever wanted to touch checkout, since you could spend hours, if not days, making the smallest change. Then QA would find more invalid states than you can dream of. And then users would report more bugs to our call center. It was just as awful as you can imagine.</p>
<p>So after some experiments, tests, and checks, I decided that we’re going React + ClojureScript way with server-side rendering done in Clojure.</p>
<h2 id="demise">Demise</h2>
<p>And for a while, things were looking good. We had this <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2017/server-side-rendering/">architecture</a> where our components are executed as Clojure on the backend, so no Node.js on the server, hurray! And developer UX is through the roof with the excellent live reload (thanks CLJS), ability to connect from your editor to browser REPL, and experiment there. It is just great!</p>
<p>To make a long story short, our frontend grew bigger and bigger. Incremental compilation started to become slower — it now routinely takes more than a second or two. And while there were few attempts on keeping the whole app performant, ultimately we failed. It’s a death by a thousand cuts. The application became too big and its boot time became too long. Server side rendering helps partially, but then hydration freezes the browser. On the older hardware or Androids it became unacceptable!</p>
<p>One of the main reasonings back in 2016 was that we take a hit on startup time, but in turn, get no page loads and have a rich web application with a lot of interactions. And for a while that worked! But startup time became longer and longer, leading to a shameful rating of 5/100 from Google’s PageSpeed (okay, it was sometimes up to ~25/100, whatever).</p>
<p>More than that, while doing what is described below, we’ve discovered that React also leads to some questionable practices. Like hovers in JS (rather than in CSS), drop-down menus in JS, not rendering hidden (under a hover) text (Google won’t be happy), weird complex logic (since it’s possible!), etc. You can have a React app without those problems, but apparently, you have to have better self-control than we had (nobody’s perfect!).</p>
<p>Also since then, the vast majority of our users switched to mobile apps. This made the web app the main entry point for new users. This means its main goal is rendering fast for a newcomer, because old-timers, which want more functionality, are on mobile app now. And <a href="https://web.dev/tti/">TTI</a> (time to interactive) is so much more important here.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-change">Time For A Change</h2>
<p>So given that circumstances have changed, what do we do? I read articles “how I survive on vanilla JS” since before React appeared and they usually don’t make sense — it’s either a pink-glassed rant about how great it is, disregarding all the problems (separation of concerns, cohesion, composability, code locality) or a project by one (or few) persons, who just keep everything in their head.</p>
<p>Somewhere back in February I stumbled upon <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">Intercooler.js</a>. I’m not sure if I ever saw it before — maybe I did but skimmed over — it does not matter. This time it captured my attention.</p>
<p>The idea is that all HTML is rendered on the server. And client updates parts of HTML, controlled by element’s attributes. Basically like HTML+XHR on steroids. You can’t do anything you want, but that’s partially the point: some limits are good so you won’t do crazy stuff. And you need some support from the server, so you can render partial results — just an optimization, but quite an important one.</p>
<p>There is an alternative library — <a href="https://unpoly.com/">Unpoly</a>. It has more features around layout and styling but has a little bit less thought out XHR stuff (hard to do a POST request with parameters without having a form, for example). And the library size is much bigger. And it’s written in CoffeeScript with lots of classes, <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/inheritance/">ugh</a>.</p>
<p>So I made a proof-of-concept implementation of our catalogue page in Intercooler and it worked! Except there was a dependency on jQuery and some other irritating stuff… As I was struggling to make a batch request for HTML fragments I understood one thing: when I wrote down a roadmap for catalogue the last point was “small intercooler-like thing for analytics”.</p>
<p>So why wait?</p>
<h2 id="twinspark">TwinSpark</h2>
<p>I liked Intercooler’s coherent approach to working around AJAX, so I decided to name the library after some automotive stuff as well, and TwinSpark seems like an appropriate name. So what’s the deal?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kasta-ua/twinspark-js">TwinSpark</a> is a framework for declarative HTML enhancement: you put additional attributes on your element and TwinSpark does something with them. Like makes an AJAX call and replaces target with a response, or adds a class, or… well, see <a href="https://kasta-ua.github.io/twinspark-js/">examples</a>, shall you?</p>
<p>There are some differences with Intercooler, of course, because why would it exist? The most noticeable one is that there is no dependency on jQuery. It supports only modern browsers (not IE or Opera Mini) but drops that 88kb monster.</p>
<p>It also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no inheritance — can’t stress that enough!</li>
<li>clear extension points for your directives</li>
<li>support for batching requests to a server</li>
<li>tighter attribute name convention (my own opinion, but <code>ic-get</code> and <code>ic-post</code> irritate me: do not make me change keys!)</li>
<li>much smaller payload (thanks to no jQuery!)</li>
<li>should be faster (thanks to no jQuery again)</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly speaking, the main reasons are <a href="https://kasta-ua.github.io/twinspark-js/#batch">batching</a> and <a href="https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/inheritance/">no inheritance</a>. Inheritance is particularly painful here. In Intercooler, if you declared <code>ic-target</code> on the body, all tags inside will think it’s their target too. So you include a component somewhere in HTML tree and an attribute higher on tree changes this component behavior. I mean this is a freaking dynamic scope, I want none of that! :)</p>
<p>Funnily enough, after about a month of dabbling with TwinSpark, Intercooler’s author announced that he’s doing a jQuery-less modern version: <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>. :) It has really good extensions points, so maybe it’s possible to add batching… but inheritance is still there. :-(</p>
<h2 id="why-is-that-a-good-idea">Why is that a good idea</h2>
<p>We need to look at it from two sides: if it’s good for developers and if it’s good for users. React was great at former and terrible at later.</p>
<p>TwinSpark approach is much better in most cases for the user: less JavaScript, less jitter, more common HTML-like behavior. In the worst case, we would serve you 2.5MB of minified (non-gzipped) JS and 700KB of HTML (half of it were initial data for React) for catalogue. JS bundle is not that big because of embedded images or css or some other obscure stuff, it’s big because it’s the whole app, with a lot of views and logic.</p>
<p>Now it’s 40KB of minified non-gzipped JS (TwinSpark, analytics, some behavior, IntersectionObserver polyfill) and 350KB of HTML. Two orders of magnitude difference and even HTML is smaller! This is just like Christmas in childhood!</p>
<p>On the developer side, I think React is better still, but code locality is great, composability is much better (since you are forced in a limited world of working in a simplistic model) than with jQuery. Plus there are a lot of ways to improve it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the development process did not change that much! We’re still writing components that query necessary data from site-wide memory store (and make a call to API when needed), but they are executed only on the server. We effectively piggy-backend on our previous architecture, and this gives us the perfect ability to render “partial” HTML - since components do not wait for some “controller” to give them all necessary data. This is what allowed us to have both React and non-React versions to co-exist and make an A/B test without writing the markup twice.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>It took us four months since the first experiments to release. Not exactly the amount of time I imagined when we started (“should take two to three weeks at most!"), heh, but we were not exclusively doing that. It still took a lot of time and energy to remove React-isms from the code and wrangle our app to be a server-side citizen. It still could use some polishing, but we decided to release it despite that just to cut it short. And A/B test showed that we were right — especially for Android phones.</p>
<p>Google gives our catalogue 75/100 now instead of 5/100. Hurray, I guess? :)</p>

  <h2>2020-02-26</h2>

<p>I used to spend all of my free time programming random toy projects. Over time, likely after spending a few years in industry, I started to spend so much time thinking about how to write maintainable code that I think I started to lose out on what makes programming fun: exploring new ideas and learning how to do things I’ve never done before. I’d like to rediscover that joy, and to do that, I need to stop being so much of a perfectionist.</p>
<p>I think that in an office setting, deadlines force me to move on and call things done, but in my personal life, lack of that kind of pressure means that I can spend literally forever architecting and rearchitecting the same piece of code until it’s perfect (it never is).</p>
<p>To fix this, I’m going to try blogging! If I can make myself excited to share my code with other people, imperfect and unfinished as it is, then maybe I can start to unlearn the paralysis that’s been plaguing me for the past few years.</p>
<p>To start, I just want to walk through a small program I wrote a few months ago. I wanted to learn how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol">SSDP</a> works, so I implemented an SSDP Directory! For those of you who aren’t aware, SSDP is a fairly simple protocol from the 90s that’s used to facilitate the discovery of network services. Nowadays, it’s also used by everything from smart TVs to Hue lights.</p>
<p>My implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory">here</a>, and the (very readable!) RFC is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cai-ssdp-v1-03">here</a>.</p>
<p>If I run the application, it discovers all of the devices on my network:</p>
<pre><code>iex(1)&gt; SSDPDirectory.list_services
%{
  "uuid:b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970::upnp:rootdevice" =&gt; %SSDPDirectory.Service{
    location: "http://192.168.0.150:60000/upnp/dev/b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970/desc",
    type: "upnp:rootdevice",
    usn: "uuid:b236f169-9c9d-db64-ffff-ffffcff91970::upnp:rootdevice"
  },
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The key to SSDP is what’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">multicast addressing</a>. Essentially, services broadcast their presence to a specially designated multicast address, and then anyone else on the network is able to listen for those presence notifications in order to track the appearance and disappearance of new services.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Elixir, my language of choice, makes subscribing to these notifications <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/multicast_channel.ex">easy</a>!</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.MulticastChannel do
  use GenServer

  alias __MODULE__

  alias SSDPDirectory.{
    Discovery,
    Presence
  }

  @multicast_group {239, 255, 255, 250}
  @multicast_port 1900

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, opts)
  end

  @spec broadcast(GenServer.name(), iodata) :: :ok
  def broadcast(channel \\ MulticastChannel, packet) do
    GenServer.cast(channel, {:broadcast, packet})
  end

  @spec init(:ok) :: {:ok, %{socket: port}}
  def init(:ok) do
    udp_options = [
      :binary,
      active: true,
      add_membership: {@multicast_group, {0, 0, 0, 0}},
      multicast_if: {0, 0, 0, 0},
      multicast_loop: false,
      reuseaddr: true
    ]

    {:ok, socket} = :gen_udp.open(@multicast_port, udp_options)

    {:ok, %{socket: socket}}
  end

  def handle_cast({:broadcast, packet}, state) do
    :ok = :gen_udp.send(state.socket, @multicast_group, @multicast_port, packet)

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info({:udp, _socket, _ip, _port, data}, state) do
    Task.Supervisor.start_child(SSDPDirectory.DecodingSupervisor, fn -&gt;
      with {:ok, packet, rest} &lt;- :erlang.decode_packet(:http_bin, data, []),
           {:ok, handler} &lt;- packet_handler(packet),
           {:ok, decoded} &lt;- handler.decode(rest) do
        :ok = handler.handle(decoded)
      end
    end)

    {:noreply, state}
  end

  defp packet_handler({:http_request, "NOTIFY", _target, _version}),
    do: {:ok, Presence}

  defp packet_handler({:http_response, _version, 200, "OK"}),
    do: {:ok, Discovery.Response}

  defp packet_handler(_packet), do: :error
end</code></pre>
<p>Most of the magic happens in the <code>init/1</code> function. By opening a UDP socket and joining it to the protocol’s multicast group, our process is now able to receive packets that are broadcast to that group. That receiving logic is located in the <code>handle_info/2</code> function within the same file.</p>
<p>When receiving a packet, we spawn another process that is responsible for handling that packet. This process runs under a <code>Task.Supervisor</code> in order to isolate crashes of that process from the <code>MulticastChannel</code>. Also interesting, is that we’re able to decode the incoming packets using <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#decode_packet-3">:erlang.decode_packet/3</a>. This is a builtin function that allows us to decode a variety of packet formats, piece-by-piece. In this case, we’re using it to parse the packet as an HTTP packet. This is the same way that Elixir’s <a href="https://github.com/elixir-mint/mint/blob/master/lib/mint/http1/response.ex#L7">Mint</a> decodes HTTP responses too!</p>
<p>Based on the type of packet decoded, <code>packet_handler/1</code> then delegates the handling of that packet to another module. Either we’ve received an HTTP NOTIFY request, and we’re dealing with a <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/presence.ex">presence notification</a>, or we’ve received a <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/discovery/response.ex">response to a discovery request</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the presence case. In case you’re curious, here’s an example presence notification:</p>
<pre><code>NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1
Host: 239.255.255.250:reservedSSDPport
NT: blenderassociation:blender
NTS: ssdp:alive
USN: someunique:idscheme3
AL: &lt;blender:ixl&gt;&lt;http://foo/bar&gt;
Cache-Control: max-age = 7393</code></pre>
<p>And here’s where we handle it:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Presence do
  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__
  alias SSDPDirectory.HTTP

  @type command :: Presence.Alive.t() | Presence.ByeBye.t()

  @spec decode(binary) ::
          :error
          | {:ok, command}
  def decode(data) do
    case HTTP.decode_headers(data, []) do
      {:ok, headers, _rest} -&gt;
        process_headers(headers)

      :error -&gt;
        _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Failed to decode NOTIFY request: " &lt;&gt; inspect(data) end)

        :error
    end
  end

  @spec handle(command) :: :ok
  def handle(%Presence.Alive{} = command) do
    Presence.Alive.handle(command)
  end

  def handle(%Presence.ByeBye{} = command) do
    Presence.ByeBye.handle(command)
  end

  defp process_headers(headers) do
    do_process_headers(headers, %{})
  end

  defp do_process_headers([], args) do
    case args do
      %{command: "ssdp:alive", usn: usn, type: type}
      when not is_nil(usn) and not is_nil(type) -&gt;
        {:ok,
         %Presence.Alive{
           usn: usn,
           type: type,
           location: Map.get(args, :location)
         }}

      %{command: "ssdp:byebye", usn: usn, type: type}
      when not is_nil(usn) and not is_nil(type) -&gt;
        {:ok,
         %Presence.ByeBye{
           usn: usn,
           type: type
         }}

      _ -&gt;
        :error
    end
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"nts", command} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :command, command)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"nt", type} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :type, type)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"usn", usn} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :usn, usn)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"al", location} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :location, location)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([{"location", location} | rest], args) do
    args = Map.put(args, :location, location)

    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end

  defp do_process_headers([_ | rest], args) do
    do_process_headers(rest, args)
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>It looks like there’s a lot going on here, but it’s actually pretty simple. Starting in <code>decode/1</code>, we continue decoding the packet from <code>MulticastChannel</code>. This time it’s the headers we’re interested in, so we decode those, and then process them in order to determine what kind of command we’re dealing with.</p>
<p>The processing step simply involves recursing over the list of headers, and accumulating the relevant ones in a map . Once we’ve done that, we just construct the corresponding command!</p>
<p>Lastly, the command handler delegates to a third module based on the type of command being processed. For example, in the case of an <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/presence/alive.ex">ssdp:alive</a> command:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Presence.Alive do
  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__

  alias SSDPDirectory.{
    Cache,
    Service
  }

  @enforce_keys [:usn, :type]
  defstruct [:location] ++ @enforce_keys

  @type t :: %Alive{}

  @spec handle(Alive.t()) :: :ok
  def handle(%Alive{} = command) do
    _ = Logger.debug(fn -&gt; "Handling ssdp:alive request: " &lt;&gt; inspect(command) end)

    service = %Service{
      usn: command.usn,
      type: command.type,
      location: command.location
    }

    :ok = Cache.insert(service)
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>Here we just construct a service using the parameters in the command, and then store it in our <a href="https://github.com/QuinnWilton/ssdp_directory/blob/master/lib/ssdp_directory/cache.ex">cache</a>:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule SSDPDirectory.Cache do
  use GenServer

  require Logger

  alias __MODULE__
  alias SSDPDirectory.Service

  def start_link(opts \\ []) do
    GenServer.start_link(Cache, :ok, opts)
  end

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The web is in need of some reinvention right now.</p><p>The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.</p><p>The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.</p><p><em>I’m going to try and dissect and diagnose this situation, a bit.

Things like dat, IPFS, and arweave are all projects to reinvent an Internet, or a transport and data-sharing layer. The web is what lies on top of that, the HTML, CSS, URLs, JavaScript, browsing experience.</details><h3 id="the-platform-collapse">The platform collapse</h3><p>The platform side is what changed last week, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">Mozilla laid off 250 employees</a> and indicated that it would affect Firefox development. Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine. One codebase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>, split into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> (Safari), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</p><p>This a textbook monoculture. In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers. But in a deeper way, it threatens one of the basic principles of how the web has evolved.</p><h3 id="specs--implementations">Specs &amp; implementations</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Decline" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.jpg"></picture></p><p>The web has evolved through a combination of <em>specifications</em> and <em>implementations</em>. Organizations like the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> have been collaboration spaces for independent developers, corporations, and academics to discuss potential new features of the web. Then, browsers would test those ideas out in a variety of implementations.</p><p>This was an interesting structural piece: it reassured us all that it was <em>possible</em> to follow along, and that a multi-participant web was one of our goals. It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually. Chrome was not always the first to jump on features, or the first to optimize.</p><p>It’s slower to collaborate than to work alone, but it was beneficial in some ways that we’ve lost now. Chrome has been moving extremely fast, adding new specifications and ideas at a startling rate, and it’s becoming one of the hardest pieces of software to replicate.</p><p>Mike Healy I think <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_hasarms/status/1296575224599556097">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Do you think the web has almost ‘priced itself out of the market’ in terms of complexity if only 1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?</p></blockquote><p>Not only is it nearly impossible to build a new browser from scratch, once you have one the ongoing cost of keeping up with standards requires a full team of experts. Read Drew DeVault’s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">Web browsers need to stop</a> for that point, and keep reading all of Drew’s stuff.</p><details><summary>What about Flow?</summary>Yep, there’s a <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/">browser called Flow</a>, which may exist and may support a full range of web standards. If it does exist, I’ll be very excited about it, but it has been teased for almost a year now without any concrete evidence, so it could equally be vaporware.</details><h3 id="the-problem-for-creators">The problem for creators</h3><p>The web has gotten much harder to develop for.</p><p>The web has had about 25 years to grow, few opportunities to shrink, and is now surrounded by an extremely short-sighted culture that is an outgrowth of economic and career short-termism. There are lots of <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">ways to do anything</a>, and some of the most popular ways of building applications on the web are - in my opinion - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">usually ghoulish overkill</a>.</p><p>The best way for folks to enter <em>web development</em> in 2020 is to choose a niche, like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and hope that there’s a CSS and accessibility expert on their team.</p><p>For folks who just want to create a web page, who don’t want to enter an industry, there’s a baffling array of techniques, but all the simplest, probably-best ones are stigmatized. It’s easier to stumble into building your resume in React with GraphQL than it is to type some HTML in Notepad.</p><h3 id="the-problem-for-consumers">The problem for consumers</h3><p>We hope that all this innovation is <em>for the user</em>, but often it isn’t. Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G). Webpage <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/webpages-are-getting-larger-every-year-and-heres-why-it-matters/">size growth</a> is outpacing it all.</p><p>The end result is that I no longer expect pages to be fast, even with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a> installed in Firefox and a good local <a href="https://sonic.net/">fiber internet provider</a>.</p><p>I don’t want to lay all of the blame at <em>those web developers</em>, though. Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no? (In that instance, I said no, and added a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a> that would block new advertiser access at the page level.)</p><h2 id="recreating-simplicity">Recreating simplicity</h2><blockquote><p>You cannot get a simple system by adding simplicity to a complex system. - <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-March/065087.html">Richard O’Keefe</a></p></blockquote><p>Where do we go from here? Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I've had the pleasure to work with very experienced firmware developers; the
kind of people who know the size of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">red
zones</a> and routinely
transform coffee into linker scripts and pointer dereferences. In other words,
the <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html">Mels</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf">Zeus
Hammers</a> of the
world.</p>
<p>When it comes to the tools of our trade, many of them are curious and
experimental. Some of them—very much myself included—explore far enough to leave
pragmatism behind and veer into idealism, stubbornly forcing beautiful round
pegs into industrial square holes. Hey, maybe they're square for a reason, but
it doesn't hurt to try.</p>
<p>The majority of them aren't like that. Your average battle-tested firmware
developer has accrued a healthy distrust of the abstract, probably born of
watching shiny platonic constructs crash and burn with painfully <em>real</em> and
<em>concrete</em> error traces. It is sobering, having to chase a hardfault on a tiny
MCU across enough vtables and templated code to make Herb Sutter puke angle
brackets. No wonder modern approaches are met with some resistance unless the
LOADs and the STOREs are in clear view.</p>
<p>I felt this way too when someone suggested to me, back in 2014, that an
up-and-coming language called <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> showed promise
in the embedded field. <em>Surely not</em>, I thought, <em>too high level.</em> Even though I
had been playing with it already, my profoundly ingrained bit-twiddling
instincts told me not to trust a language that supported functional programming,
or one that dared to have an <em>opinion</em> on how I managed my memory. Bah! That's
how you get philosophers to run out of forks, and your forks to turn into
SIGSEGVs.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Through the past five years of experimentation, I've gone from intrigued, to
optimistic, to <em>convinced</em> that Rust is an ideal language to build industrial
grade, bulletproof bare metal software. Beyond that, I've come to realize that
even the highest level constructs that the base language offers are applicable
to firmware development, very much unlike other languages that span a wide range
of paradigms (I'm looking at you, C++). There are a few reasons I felt this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust's safety guarantees and general strictness bring the debug time down
significantly, so there's less need to spend time developing mental maps of
how high level constructs correspond to hardware primitives.</li>
<li>The type system is <em>great</em> at enforcing local reasoning and preventing leaky
abstractions. Building decoupled systems with no runtime cost is easy.</li>
<li>The compiler error messages are worthy of an AI assistant with <em>concerning</em>
mind-reading abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lately, I've had the chance to work on a Rust
<a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f412.html">STM32F412</a>
project in a professional setting, with one of the goals being to foster a Rust
knowledge pool at my company. The project, <code>Loadstone</code>, is a 32kb secure
bootloader targeting bare metal devices for the medical industry.</p>
<p>While it would've been easier—and much less of a headache to my colleagues—to
stick to a subset of Rust more familiar to C developers, with your <code>for</code>s, your
<code>*mut u8</code>s and your <code>unsafe</code>s, I instead decided not to pull any punches and
make liberal use of generics, iterator adapters, typestate programming and other
stuff that would've made 2010's cuervo cry blood and hug the closest copy of
Kernighan and Ritchie.</p>
<p>The pressures of a real collaborative project have taught me a lot, and many
assumptions have been refined thanks to the criticism of several skilled
outsiders who, as outsiders often do, had a privileged view on things I took for
granted.</p>
<p>A topic that came up frequently in code review is
<a href="https://thume.ca/2019/07/14/a-tour-of-metaprogramming-models-for-generics/">generics</a>.
Perhaps still recovering from a SFINAE nightmare, some colleagues were
unsure about the use of generics to group behaviour that we'd normally write
separate implementations for. The concerns tended to fall in one of three
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runtime performance.</li>
<li>Binary size bloat.</li>
<li>Habitability and readability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is easy to dispel, as it often comes from unfamiliarity with static
dispatch. No vtables or heap allocations in anything we're doing, promise! The
second concern is valid but I've found it to be negligible in practice; I have
plans for another blog post giving some concrete benchmarks.</p>
<p>The last concern is the most subjective and thus the hardest to argue, so I
decided to focus on it in this blog series. I'll go over the design process of
two similar flash memory drivers, and hopefully show how generic programming can
make the job easier and the result more habitable, even in the barren, heapless,
rugged world of bare metal firmware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compile times are another common—and very valid—argument against liberal use
of generics. However, it is not a big problem for low footprint embedded
projects like this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">Flash memory</a> is electronic
non-volatile storage. It's ubiquitous in consumer electronics; any time you
switch a small device off and it <em>remembers something</em>—whether it's settings,
songs, documents, even its own program—chances are you have flash memory to
thank. We'll be looking at two different <em>NOR</em> flash chips, since the first demo
port of <code>Loadstone</code> requires us to operate both:</p>
<ul>
<li>The embedded
<a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f412.html">STM32F412</a>
1MB MCU flash.</li>
<li>The external 128MB <a href="https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/data-sheet/nor-flash/serial-nor/n25q/n25q_128mb_1_8v_65nm.pdf">Micron
N25Q128</a>
flash chip present in the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f412gdiscovery.html">STM32F412ZGT6 Discovery
Kit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You probably knew what flash memory is used for already, but what non-firmware
developers may not know is that flash memory is <em>quirky</em>. You cannot simply
write a byte to a NOR flash address, sir, that would be rude. While a blob of
flash memory will happily turn a <code>1</code> into a <code>0</code>, the opposite operation will
fail silently.</p>
<p>You can think of every <code>1</code> bit (NOR flash's <em>erased</em> state) as a lit candle you
can blow out. However, in this metaphor you don't get a lighter
to light them back up; you get a flamethrower. Without getting into the hardware
principles involved, the design of NOR flash memory requires that you erase
(i.e. set to <code>1</code>) memory <em>in bulk</em>, in chunks often orders of magnitude bigger
than the minimum addressable memory. On most chips you even have a three way
mismatch: your read, write and erase sizes aren't equal. Ugh.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this makes writing flash drivers a bit of a pain,
particularly because even the smallest write operations turn into <em>read/write
cycles</em>. Writing a single byte requires reading the minimum erasable block
surrounding the targeted address (which may itself require multiple reads),
potentially erasing the entire block, then writing back the original data merged
with the desired byte.</p>
<p>As you can also imagine, nobody but the person writing this driver <em>wants to
care about this</em>. Even in the minimalistic world of bare metal software,
productive collaboration depends on developers filing away these sharp edges,
presenting interfaces that uniformize or hide any aspects of hardware irrelevant
to the bigger design. As such, a first stab at a flash memory interface should
simply offer a way to read and write ranges of memory.</p>
<p>Let's look at some code:</p>
<pre><code><span>pub trait </span><span>ReadWrite {
   </span><span>type </span><span>Error;
   </span><span>type </span><span>Address;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>address</span><span>: </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>: </span><span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>]) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
   </span><span>fn </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; (</span><span>Self::</span><span>Address, </span><span>Self::</span><span>Address);
   </span><span>fn </span><span>erase</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;(), </span><span>Self::</span><span>Error&gt;;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The above is what I converged on as a generic interface to a flash
driver. If you're unfamiliar with Rust generics, the above isn't a type, or a
parent class to inherit from. It's more like a Haskell typeclass; a set of
requirements for a concrete type to implement, described in this case in the
form of associated types (<code>Error</code> and <code>Address</code>) and method signatures (<code>read</code>,
<code>write</code>, <code>range</code> and <code>erase</code>).</p>
<p>Even at this early step, some tradeoffs have to be made. The keen,
hardfault-traumatized reader will notice that this interface doesn't lend itself
well to timing sensitive problems. All methods are blocking, and abstracting the
read/write cycle away will naturally lead to non-deterministic write times; a
write may take very little if it only requires toggling bits off, or it might
take very long if it straddles two big sectors requiring erase operations. The
<code>bytes</code> output parameter in <code>read</code> might also strike you as not too rusty, where
returning a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> is often idiomatic. Unfortunately we have no heap to work
with, so if you want to take your bytes home you'll have to bring your own bag.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's hard to write the universal interface. This one made sense for the
problems we're solving, but make sure to keep in mind the requirements of your
project!</p>
<h3 id="why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type">Why not simply write a concrete type?<a href="#why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-not-simply-write-a-concrete-type">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Ah, the word "simply" is tricky. Datasheet in hand, it may have been easier to
write. It might even save us a few bytes down the line. But altogether I think
the benefits of starting here are well worth the drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easy to write test doubles and leverage static dispatch for unit
testing. This kind of approach is what I miss the most when writing C, where
I'm forced to resort to link time substitution or to do things with the
preprocessor too vile to even mention here.</li>
<li>Decouples your design from the get go and makes collaboration easy. Another
developer can immediately start working against this interface, and it's
abstract enough to give you confidence it won't need to be changed as more
knowledge of the hardware emerges.</li>
<li>Going abstract first forces you to think long and hard about what behaviour is
common to each implementation and what behaviour isn't, which helps to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">not
repeat yourself</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the biggest reason, and one where C++ and Rust diverge, is the fact that
<em>you can reason about this interface locally</em>. This stems from a non-obvious
difference between the C++ template system and Rust traits. Where C++ templates
type check at the point of instantiation, Rust traits type check at the point of
definition.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that the inscrutable, seven-feet-deep-in-a-library
C++ template errors are impossible in Rust, because the compiler doesn't need to
go beyond the interface to prove it is used correctly.</p>
<p>A similar interface using C++ …</p></div></div>

    <h3>Finding vulnerable Twitter accounts with expired domains</h3>
    <p>August 23, 2020</p>
    <p>Recently, I discovered a simple yet suprisingly effective attack vector against Twitter accounts (and which likely applies to other platforms as well). This attack vector makes it easy to find and hack vulnerable accounts with login emails that are using expired domains. If a user creates a Twitter account with an email on their own domain, then forgets to renew their domain at some point, that account can be hijacked by registering the domain, forwarding all emails to your email, then submitting a password reset on that account. By itself, this is hardly an attack vector since finding such vulnerable accounts is the more important part, and we already know that owning someone's email is essentially a "game over" situation. This attack becomes more dangerous when you can combine it with an efficient method to find these vulnerable accounts quickly and at scale. As it turns out, this is trivial on Twitter for several reasons attributable to their platform design.</p>
    <p>If you're familiar with Twitter, you know that users are given the option to add a public website url. With a simple script and proxy, an attacker can quickly iterate over millions of accounts and check if the domain in that url is not registered; this usually indicates some likelihood that the Twitter account was created with an email address on a now-expired domain. To verify this, they can submit a password reset which will show them a censored version of the account email address for confirmation; however, even though it's censored, it still provides enough information to check if the email domain matches the expired domain listed on their account profile. If it does, the attacker now knows this is an account that can be hacked. Once this entire process is automated, it makes finding these accounts very easy. This method of account hijacking is very likely being used right now by malicious hackers, and I believe it accounts for a large portion of stolen accounts/handles on the platform.</p>
    <img src="https://zainamro.com/assets/img/twitter-emails.png">
    <p>This attack can potentially be executed on other platforms besides Twitter, assuming one can find a similar discovery method. In Twitter's case, they could make it harder to discover these accounts by not showing any email confirmation upon requesting a password reset. This would make the process more costly for attackers who would no longer be able to verify whether an account can be hacked prior to registering the domain. Or perhaps, Twitter should monitor and unlist domains that are no longer registered and notify users when this happens so that they're aware. As for most users, in addition to turning on 2FA, it's important to be very cautious when using an email on your own domain to create accounts; it makes it much easier to lose access if you forget to renew or can't under certain extreme circumstances like incarceration or death.</p>

    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2020</time>
    </p>
    

<p>I quit my job in January 2020 to build a privacy friendly photo organizer.</p>

<p>As a 30 year old whose friends are either getting married or planning
off-springs, what I had underestimated was the difficulty involved in finding a co-founder and how that would compound the difficulty involved in
finding an investor.</p>

<p>Once I accepted the loneliness and the lack of a financial cushion I had to figure out a way to keep building without burning myself out.</p>

<p>It took me a while, but I have found a rhythm that works, and with it, a steady
source of endorphins. Here are some changes that helped me to keep things
moving.</p>

<h2 id="being-patient">Being patient</h2>

<p>Life is no longer as comfortable as it used to be and things are not always
going the way I want them to. Preseverance has been key and indirectly patience
too. Naval’s <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289" target="_blank">take on
meditation</a> (60 minutes x
60 days), was an eye opener. I’ve stuck with it since, and I now have an easier
time identifying negative thought patterns and sitting out situations that would
otherwise overwhelm me.</p>

<p>On some level, spending the last few months locked indoors with my parents, who
are not the most rational people in the world has also helped. But I wouldn’t
recommend it.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-procrastination">Reducing procrastination</h2>

<p>Over time I’ve realized that action precedes motivation and procrastination precedes guilt.</p>

<p>Breaking down tasks into chunks that seem trivial to accomplish has helped reduce the friction in getting started on unexciting grunt work.</p>

<p>Then there are tasks which I loathe from my core, like writing out applications
to VCs explaining why what I’m doing will matter. To those I attach reinforcing
personal reasons, like, “I need the $50k to hire that college junior who I love
working with, and that will give me spare bandwidth to focus on traction channels”.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-clearer">Thinking clearer</h2>

<p>It is sub-optimal to not have a coworker to bounce ideas off and rant about problems to. A lot of times it’s these conversations that help you gain clarity.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury I do not have so every time I feel stuck, I type/scribble my thoughts out, and then question everything that was written, and then document my realizations.</p>

<p>Task tracking has also helped in clearing the path. I write down unstructured
thoughts into a diary, and once I’ve clarity, I promote them to a Notion board
(that’s divided into <em>Thinking</em>, <em>Building</em>, <em>Reading</em>, <em>Writing</em> and
<em>Adulting</em>) and every Monday within an Excel sheet I track what was done, and
what is left to be done.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-distractions">Reducing distractions</h2>

<p>I’ve reduced my information consumption to free up brain cycles. I’ve disabled all notifications on my phone barring a few contacts, and I’ve more or less stopped browsing on it. As an added bonus, this has reduced the negativity with which I perceived the world.</p>

<p>To minimize the overhead of context switches, I split tasks into a tree of checkpoints. Before taking a break I note down the next simplest checkpoint so that when I get back to work there’s little friction to resume.</p>

<p>To help me zone out I keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A" target="_blank">lofi
beats</a> or
<a href="http://github.audio/" target="_blank">github.audio</a> playing in the background. Listening to the
latter gives me a strange sense of motivation and makes me feel less alone.</p>

<h2 id="staying-grounded">Staying grounded</h2>

<p>I’m lucky to have some friends who call/text every other week. I look at them as my accountability partners and I talk to them about what I’m doing on a high level. While not all of them genuinely care, some do, and these conversations force me to reflect on how well I’m doing what I’m doing.</p>

<p>While Silicon Valley wisdom suggests that if I’m not sleeping I should be
working, failing because of a burn out would be stupid. An advantage of not
having a VC onboard so far has been the freedom to dictate my pace. So I spend
days thinking, reading, fiddling with my violin or just doing nothing when I
feel like writing code is not what I want to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s been 7 months of building alone, and while this is not how I pictured things to be on my last day at work, this is the happiest I have ever been. There’s a long way to go, and the grind seems inviting.</p>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, for I’m still learning. If you’ve
anything to share, please join <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24251403" target="_blank">the discussion on HackerNews</a>.</p>

					<p>I love reading. But retaining what I read tends to be a challenge. I usually walk away from a book feeling good but with only a faint idea of what was in there. Heck, if I spend a couple hours online I’ll barely remember what articles I read! And it’s not just me, studies show that <a href="https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1379/brain-science-the-forgetting-curvethe-dirty-secret-of-corporate-training">you only retain a tiny percentage of what you read</a>.</p><p>I hated the idea of wasting all that time I spent reading, so a year ago I started looking into ways to retain what I learned.</p><p>My first attempt led me to Farnam Street’s tips on <a href="https://fs.blog/2014/05/remembering-what-you-read/">remembering what you read</a>. Their concept of writing your notes on the book itself was liberating (it’s okay to WRITE in my book?!?). Actively writing down notes helped me get more insights out of the text, but those thoughts would then be trapped in the analogue world, locked away until I happened to peruse the book some time in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-1--1-.png 769w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>FS also suggested writing down the book’s core ideas from memory right after you finish the book, but this is a process that requires discipline (unless you like testing yourself?) and things requiring discipline have a distressing tendency to not happen.</p><p>Those tips were exciting, but I couldn’t stick with it. I needed something different.</p><p>Next I came across the <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten note taking method</a>. Its core idea is to create atomic notes, where each note is about exactly one topic (not more than a few paragraphs tops) and nothing more. Then you file the away in your system by linking that note to other notes which seem most relevant to it. All the notes are written in your own words, so you’re really writing down your own thoughts here.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-2--1-.png 616w"></figure><p>The key here is that the linking process <strong><strong>groups relevant notes together</strong></strong>. Now when you’re interested in browsing your notes on a given topic, you’ll easily find them. You get to see how your ideas relate to each other as well as discover interesting ways they may play off against or even contradict one another.</p><p>But this technique is time intensive. You have to:</p><ul><li>Save the initial note, paraphrasing what you learned</li><li>Search for relevant notes to link it to</li><li>Potentially update your table of contents to find that note more easily later on</li></ul><p>If you take a lot of notes, the stream of incoming notes can quickly leave you overwhelmed. This technique requires time and dedication.</p><p>I couldn’t stick with it.</p><p>Finally I discovered Building a Second Brain and it’s <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/">P.A.R.A</a> technique. It offers an easier option for busy people.</p><p>With P.A.R.A. you organize all your notes by purpose, not by category. Let’s say you’re trying to build an app. You’ll have a folder called ‘app’ for all notes about it. Now if you study databases in order to build it, you’ll file any notes you take inside the ‘app’ folder, not in a separate ‘databases’ folder.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/07/2020-05-08-Remember-20what-20you-20read-20-3--1-.png 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What does this do? By creating purpose-based folders and putting all notes related to that <em>purpose</em> inside it, we’ve created a new way to group relevant notes together. All your notes related to that purpose are available front and center when you open the folder. This lets you avoid the time consuming process of sorting, organizing, and linking your notes in order to make them useful. Just drop the note in the right folder and BAM, that’s it.</p><p>How do you reference old notes? When you start working on a new project (like a writing assignment) you search the relevant folders and pull out notes that seem relevant to your task. All those notes will go into the new project’s folder. You’re effectively discovering related notes on the fly. You’ve avoided the work of double linking and cross referencing your notes. This solution gets you 80% of the way there with 20% of the effort. Just in Time linking.</p><p>When you finish a project, you file away the notes from that project in which ever folder you think they’ll be most useful in, and then archive the project folder. Now you’ve reset the notes to be discoverable the next time you need them.</p><p>And it’s not just good for retention. I’m finding that this purpose-based organization is helping me work much more productively on all my projects!</p><p>Even the step of summarizing what you read is optimized for efficiency. It’s called <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/">Progressive Summarization</a></p><p>With progressive summarization you don’t bother summarizing what you’re learning, at least not at first. Instead you take the passages you found most interesting and copy them into your notes. If you ever reread those notes in the future then you can start highlighting the phrases that really spoke to you and if you reread them again, only then will you do the work to summarize the ideas in your own words.</p><p>It’s not that summarizing your notes from the beginning is bad, but if you procrastinate on it while still expecting yourself to do it then you’re setting yourself up for failure. Progressive summarization offers you a way to delay summarization while still retaining value.</p><p>Note what’s happened here: Instead of forcing myself to be disciplined about organizing my notes, P.A.R.A. + Progressive Summarization takes advantage of the times when I’m <strong><strong>already excited to work on them</strong></strong>. Each time I touch the notes, I have to take a small amount of effort which is proportionate to my level of interest in the task. <strong><strong>We’ve replaced forced discipline with leveraged excitement.</strong></strong></p><p>There is one other critical aspect of PARA that’s required to keep the system from being overwhelming. Successful followers of the Zettelkasten method seem to follow this instinctively, but <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">it’s rarely mentioned</a>:</p><p>You’re highly encouraged to <strong><strong>limit</strong></strong> the kind of things you save in your second brain to the following:</p><ul><li>Things related to projects you’re <em>actively</em> working on. Don’t store trivia</li><li>Store things that surprise you: Don’t store stuff you already know</li><li>A 12 select problems that you love to think about</li></ul><p>Tiago recommends thinking about <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-use-evernote-for-your-creative-workflow/">the 12 problems you care most about</a> and <em>only</em> store things related to those problems in your notebook (so skip the articles about ancient mummies…unless you’re an archaeologist).</p><p>By limiting which topics you put in your second brain you free up more cognitive space to notice what you do store. By storing less you’ll remember more 🤯</p><p>Not making your second brain cognitively overwhelming is an under-emphasized part of the PARA system. There shouldn’t be anything in your project’s section unless you are actively working on it. Even the other sections are also meant to be pruned on a regular basis so that they only represent your primary interests. A good rule of thumb: if any folder gains more notes than you can easily skim (~50-100 notes), it might be time to split that folder into two or maybe even delete some notes.</p><p>This is by no means a complete comparison of Zettlekasten and P.A.R.A. (that would be a much longer essay) but it captures the major points.</p><p>Zettelkasten has its benefits: If you want to be able to casually browse through your notes, looking for ideas to spark your imagination, Zettelkasten will most likely have superior results since the ideas are already summarized right there for you. Zettelkasten makes it easy to compose essays and put together speeches, but that’s because you’ve already done the hard work of writing down your thoughts ahead of time.</p><p>It’s requirement to link all notes ahead of time is a HUGE barrier to entry, so Zettlekasten may be best suited to people with a strong research oriented disposition who’re already used to similar practices. The fact that there’s no good software available to help with this makes the process even harder. (Check out <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUw5PuD8op9oq8kHvni6sug6eRTNtR9Wqma">Andy Matuschak’s notes</a> for a gorgeous Zettlekasten example)</p><p>P.A.R.A. is great for those who don’t have the time (or willpower) to force themselves to write down notes they may never use. Instead it’s Just-in-Time philosophy saves many hours and lets you be more productive. Tiago has designed P.A.R.A. to work with most productivity apps, but the process is optimized for his app of choice: Evernote.</p><p>All in all, I’m finding P.A.R.A. pretty useful so far. It has yet to pass the ultimate test of any knowledge management system: Will I still be using it three months from now? (ask me after July). I’m already noticing productivity boosts by using the PARA method to store notes for all my projects, so prospects are looking good 😁</p>
