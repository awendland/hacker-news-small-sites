<p>This is the fourth…and LAST…entry in my series of blog posts analyzing the accuracy of Ray Kurzweil’s predictions about what things would be like in 2019. These predictions come from his 1998 book&nbsp;<em>The Age of Spiritual Machines</em>.&nbsp;You can view the previous installments of this series here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-1/">Part 1</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-2/">Part 2</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.militantfuturist.com/how-ray-kurzweils-2019-predictions-are-faring-pt-3/">Part 3</a></p>



<p><strong><em>“An undercurrent of concern is developing with regard to the influence of machine intelligence. There continue to be differences between human and machine intelligence, but the advantages of human intelligence are becoming more difficult to identify and articulate. Computer intelligence is thoroughly interwoven into the mechanisms of civilization and is designed to be outwardly subservient to apparent human control. On the one hand, human transactions and decisions require by law a human agent of responsibility, even if fully initiated by machine intelligence. On the other hand, few decisions are made without significant involvement and consultation with machine-based intelligence.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>MOSTLY RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>Technological advances have moved concerns over the influence of machine intelligence to the fore in developed countries. In many domains of skill previously considered hallmarks of intelligent thinking, such as driving vehicles, recognizing images and faces, analyzing data, writing short documents, and even diagnosing diseases, machines had achieved human levels of performance by the end of 2019. And in a few niche tasks, such as playing Go, chess, or poker, machines were superhuman. Eroded human dominance in these and other fields did indeed force philosophers and scientists to grapple with the meaning of “intelligence” and “creativity,” and made it harder yet more important to define how human thinking was still special and useful. </p>



<p>While the prospect of artificial general intelligence was still viewed with skepticism, there was no real doubt among experts and laypeople in 2019 that task-specific AIs and robots would continue improving, and without any clear upper limit to their performance. This made technological unemployment and the solutions for it frequent topics of public discussion across the developed world. In 2019, one of the candidates for the upcoming U.S. Presidential election, Andrew Yang, even made these issues central to his political platform. </p>



<p>If “algorithms” is another name for “computer intelligence” in the prediction’s text, then yes, it is woven into the mechanisms of civilization and is ostensibly under human control, but in fact drives human thinking and behavior. To the latter point, great alarm has been raised over how algorithms used by social media companies and advertisers affect sociopolitical beliefs (particularly, conspiracy thinking and closedmindedness), spending decisions, and mental health. </p>



<p>Human transactions and decisions still require a “human agent of responsibility”: Autonomous cars aren’t allowed to drive unless a human is in the driver’s seat, human beings ultimately own and trade (or authorize the trading of) all assets, and no military lets its autonomous fighting machines kill people without orders from a human. The only part of the prediction that seems wrong is the last sentence. Probably most decisions that humans make are done without consulting a “machine-based intelligence.” Consider that most daily purchases (e.g. – where to go for lunch, where to get gas, whether and how to pay a utility bill) involve little thought or analysis. A frighteningly large share of investment choices are also made instinctively, with benefit of little or no research. However, it should be noted that one area of human decision-making, dating, has become much more data-driven, and it was common in 2019 for people to use sorting algorithms, personality test results, and other filters to choose potential mates. </p>



<p><strong><em>“Public and private spaces are routinely monitored by machine intelligence to prevent interpersonal violence.”</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>MOSTLY RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>Gunfire detection systems, which are comprised of networks of microphones emplaced across an area and which use machine intelligence to recognize the sounds of gunshots and to triangulate their origins, were emplaced in over 100 cities at the end of 2019. The dominant company in this niche industry, “ShotSpotter,” used human analysts to review its systems’ results before forwarding alerts to local police departments, so the systems were not truly automated, but nonetheless they made heavy use of machine intelligence. </p>



<p>Automated license plate reader cameras, which are commonly mounted next to roads or on police cars, also use machine intelligence and are widespread. The technology has definitely reduced violent crime, as it has allowed police to track down stolen vehicles and cars belonging to violent criminals faster than would have otherwise been possible. </p>



<p>In some countries, surveillance cameras with facial recognition technology monitor many public spaces. The cameras compare the people they see to mugshots of criminals, and alert the local police whenever a wanted person is seen. China is probably the world leader in facial recognition surveillance, and in a famous 2018 case, it used the technology to find one criminal among 60,000 people who attended a concert in Nanchang. </p>



<p>At the end of 2019, several organizations were researching ways to use machine learning for real-time recognition of violent behavior in surveillance camera feeds, but the systems were not accurate enough for commercial use. </p>



<p><strong><em>“People attempt to protect their privacy with near-unbreakable encryption technologies, but privacy continues to be a major political and social issue with each individual’s practically every move stored in a database somewhere.” </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>In 2013, National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden leaked a massive number of secret documents, revealing the true extent of his employer’s global electronic surveillance. The world was shocked to learn that the NSA was routinely tracking the locations and cell phone call traffic of millions of people, and gathering enormous volumes of data from personal emails, internet browsing histories, and other electronic communications by forcing private telecom and internet companies (e.g. – Verizon, Google, Apple) to let it secretly search through their databases. Together with British intelligence, the NSA has the tools to spy on the electronic devices and internet usage of almost anyone on Earth. </p>

<p>Snowden also revealed that the NSA unsurprisingly had sophisticated means for cracking encrypted communications, which it routinely deployed against people it was spying on, but that even its capabilities had limits. Because some commercially available encryption tools were too time-consuming or too technically challenging to crack, the NSA secretly pressured software companies and computing hardware manufacturers to install “backdoors” in their products, which would allow the Agency to bypass any encryption their owners implemented. </p>



<p>During the 2010s, big tech titans like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple also came under major scrutiny for quietly gathering vast amounts of personal data from their users, and reselling it to third parties to make hundreds of billions of dollars. The decade also saw many epic thefts of sensitive personal data from corporate and government databases, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. </p>



<p>With these events in mind, it’s quite true that concerns over digital privacy and confidentiality of personal data have become “major political and social issues,” and that there’s growing displeasure at the fact that “each individual’s practically every move stored in a database somewhere.” The response has been strongest in the European Union, which, in 2018, enacted the most stringent and impactful law to protect the digital rights of individuals–the “General Data Protection Regulation” (GDPR). </p>



<p>Widespread awareness of secret government surveillance programs and of the risk of personal electronic messages being made public thanks to hacks have also bolstered interest in commercial encryption. “Whatsapp” is a common text messaging app with built-in end-to-end encryption. It was invented in 2016 and had 1.5 billion users by 2019. “Tor” is a web browser with built-in encryption that became relatively common during the 2010s after it was learned even the NSA couldn’t spy on people who used it. Additionally, virtual private networks (VPNs), which provide an intermediate level of data privacy protection for little expense and hassle, are in common use. </p>



<p><strong><em>“The existence of the human underclass continues as an issue. While there is sufficient prosperity to provide basic necessities (secure housing and food, among others) without significant strain to the economy, old controversies persist regarding issues of responsibility and opportunity.” </em></strong></p>



<p><strong>RIGHT</strong></p>



<p>It’s unclear whether this prediction pertained to the U.S., to rich countries in aggregate, or to the world as a whole, and “underclass” is not defined, so we can’t say whether it refers only to desperately poor people who are literally starving, or to people who are better off than that but still under major daily stress due to lack of money. Whatever the case, by any reasonable definition, there is an “underclass” of people in almost every country. </p>



<p>In the U.S. and other rich countries, welfare states provide even the poorest people with access to housing, food, and other needs, though there are still those who go without because severe mental illness and/or drug addiction keep them stuck in homeless lifestyles and render them too behaviorally disorganized to apply for government help or to be admitted into free group housing. Some people also live in destitution in rich countries because they are illegal immigrants or fugitives with arrest warrants, and contacting the authorities for welfare assistance would lead to their detection and …</p></div></article></div>

<p>People sometimes ask me for robotics resources. There aren’t many high quality internet-first lists available on this topic, so I made one I can link to. I’ll continually update this list so feel free to give <strong><a href="mailto:arthur@allshire.org">suggestions if things are missing or you have better links</a></strong>.</p>
<p>There’s some more interesting comments on this topic in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25608932">HN discussion</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-advice">General Advice</h3>
<p>Robotics can be overwhelming from the sheer number of fields involved (everything from mathematics to physics to computer science to mechanical engineering enters in). Remember: <em>you won’t start as an expert in anything; you can’t end up as an expert in everything</em>. Also learning will not be a linear path; outside of courses, acquire knowledge as you need it in projects.</p>
<p>Try as much as possible to avoid this antipattern (I still struggle)…
</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An illustrated guide to learning absolutely nothing <a href="https://t.co/bKIMX2r6iU">pic.twitter.com/bKIMX2r6iU</a></p>— Eugene Vinitsky (@EugeneVinitsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/EugeneVinitsky/status/1343701831210307586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h4 id="communities">Communities</h4>
<p>Instead of attempting to pre-load your head with maximum theory, try to get as much <strong>practical experience</strong> as possible (see below), whether that be joining a club, lab, or if you’re lucky in an internship or job.</p>
<p>It is incredibly hard to do something on your own without some kind of <a href="https://dcgross.com/the-environment-diet/">environmental forcing function</a>.  If at all possible, embed yourself in a community of people working on problems of interest to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST robotics competition</a> - Simply put, FRC was the awesomest thing ever for me. If you can find a team, beg them to let you participate…</li>
<li>If you are a student at a university - try joining a lab!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately outside of these robotics is currently not an easy field to break into. The sheer number of ‘moving parts’ to a (useful) robotic system - from hardware to drivers to algorithms to user interfaces - means it’s tough to hack together a demo in a few weeks, get users, and bootstrap / apply to some accelerator like in many software projects. Making the jump from “hacker” to “career”, even with all the knowledge in the world is hard. If you know solutions to this, let me know.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p><strong>Computer programming</strong> - this is essential if you want to do basically anything in robotics. Python and <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html">C++</a> are the most important languages to know - learn both.
Familiarity with basic data-structures and algorithms concepts is helpful for problem solving and in some fields like motion planning but initially less vital than you may think - it’s not necessary to be a master leetcoder.</p>
<p><strong>Maths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Linear algebra - vital in most topics beyond basic basic control. If you want to become an expert, <a href="https://linear.axler.net/">Axler’s book</a> is good (though I didn’t make it through the whole thing 😳).</li>
<li>Calculus - fundamental differential calculus and partial derivatives is required to understand optimisation algorithms which are everywhere in robo.</li>
<li>The book <a href="https://pimbook.org/">A Programmer’s Introduction to Mathematics</a> is actually a solid foundation if you want a quick overview of both of the above topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="important-concepts">Important Concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Controllers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wiki’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a> isn’t bad if you want to learn the basics (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/">95%</a> of controllers used in industry are PID). Ben Recht’s <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/04/19/pid/">blog post</a> is also decent.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/ee/ee392m/ee392m.1056/">These course slides</a> are good for basics and more advanced concepts like <strong>MPC</strong> .</li>
<li><a href="https://janismac.github.io/ControlChallenges/">Control challenges</a> is a set of (very fun) challenges that will allow you to test your ability to write basic controllers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8319J1BEHwM">This talk</a> from FIRST Robotics team 254 is great for going over the basics of robot control and showing how we can improve on basic PID using simple interpolation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathematics and Mechanics of Robotics &amp; Manipulation</strong> - This set of <a href="http://www.nathanratliff.com/pedagogy">notes by Nathan Ratliff</a> provides a great overview of many topics.  These <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/robotics-n-intelligent-systems/rsl-dam/documents/RobotDynamics2017/RD_HS2017script.pdf">notes on robot dynamics</a> from ETH are also great.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python">Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python</a> is a great read with interactive notebook examples throughout. Good for building intuition on both Bayesian statistics as well as how filters for linear and nonlinear dynamical systems work. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Technical_description_and_context">wiki article on the Kalman Filter</a>  and <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/">this blog post</a> is also well written if you want a shorter overview.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning &amp; Neural Networks</strong> - Focus less on the basics of machine learning than the application of neural networks as function approximators, which is their primary utility as perception and decision making modules in robotics. <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Michael Nielsen’s book</a> is my favourite resource in this regard. The <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">canonical deep learning book</a> is good reference but you don’t need to read the whole thing - pick out specific topics as required.</p>
<p><strong>Path and motion planning</strong> - Wiki has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning">decent overview</a> and details some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree">basic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">algorithms</a>. I haven’t read it but this book is apparently a <a href="http://lavalle.pl/planning/">good comprehensive guide</a>, and a course based on it is available <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/courses/winter2019motionplanning/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> &amp; more on controllers - Ben Recht’s “<a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">outsider’s tour of RL</a>” provides a nice concise overview of many relevant concepts and ties them to classical control. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/spinning-up-in-deep-rl/">Spinning up in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> is another great reference on the topic and exhibits many of the most important algorithms for research in the field.</p>
<h3 id="other-topics--resources">Other Topics &amp; Resources</h3>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li>For beginners looking for a single book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62533-1">Elements of Robotics</a> looks like an a great resource, and I’m only sorry it didn’t exist when I was starting. Provides self-contained introductions to many topics listed, pitched at a level high-schoolers / beginning university students can understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781846286414">Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25609653">apparently</a> an all time classic covering many topics listed above..</li>
<li>Convex Optimisation is used in everything from simulators to controllers and beyond. I intend to read the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">canonical book</a> (free) at some point.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="courses">Courses</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Berkley <strong><a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa19/">Advanced Robotics</a></strong> course provides relatively self contained expositions of many topics in lecture format (don’t be scared off by the ‘advanced' moniker, it’s not that incomprehensible 😅.)</li>
<li>Russ Tedrake’s courses on <a href="http://underactuated.mit.edu/">Underactuated Robotics</a> and <a href="http://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/">Manipulation</a> seem really high quality (I haven’t gotten around to doing them myself yet).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>The space of software is so vast I couldn’t fit it all here… <a href="http://jslee02.github.io/awesome-robotics-libraries/">this list</a> provides a much more comprehensive overview in this regard. Some utilities I’ve found useful are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ros.org/install/">ROS</a> is very widely used many projects, worth picking up the basics.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html">RLLib</a> has implementations of many reinforcement learning algorithms and support for distributed training.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="simulators">Simulators</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite">Robosuite</a> is great for robot learning and has many richly-designed built-in environments.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym">Isaac Gym</a> is recently released and provides extremely fast samples for reinforcement learning. It does this by running thousands of environments in parallel on the GPU (in almost all other sims physics is run on the CPU meaning you can only run one environment at once). You can train tasks in minutes that previously took hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interesting-lines-of-work">Interesting Lines of Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Randomisation</strong>  is highly underrated, and will likely get more important as we get faster simulators which are able to generalize better. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/">Learning Dexterity</a> from OpenAI is a very interesting paper, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRupIVknV-A">line</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01728.pdf">work</a> around improving simulator parameter show two different and interesting takes on this powerful approach.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> in reinforcement learning has shown promising results in getting behaviour that generalises, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08399.pdf">DeepGait</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15119">UniCon</a> paper being two interesting examples.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03135">DexPilot</a> is a really cool low-cost system for teleoperation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGE-deYfb8I">video</a>). Partially inspired <a href="https://allshire.org/teleop/">my piece on teleoperation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Probably my weakest area… up for recommendations about specific great resources.
<a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/">OnShape</a> is a great resource for designing things and is great even with minimal CAD experience (even I am able to use it!)</p>
<p><a href="https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/">Open Dynamic Robot initiative</a> has many robots that you can build with off-the-shelf components.</p>
<p>Others' recommendations -</p>
<p>In the HN thread, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25612255">contingencies had some tips</a> on how to get started yourself on the hardware side.</p>
<p>I’m told cadathons such as those <a href="https://blogs.solidworks.com/tech/2020/03/20-years-of-model-mania.html">organised by Solidworks</a> are a good way to get started. They also have a <a href="https://my.solidworks.com/training/path/14/cswa-exam-prep-course">series of lessons</a> on CADding fundamentals.</p>
<p><a href="https://grabcad.com/">GrabCAD</a> has big libries of pre-existing models you can use.</p>
<h3 id="business-of-robotics">Business of Robotics</h3>
<p>Very interesting side of things, however there is somewhat of a paucity of resources (I’m pretty sure many in the space refrain from publishing their theses.) Please send if you have others I have missed!</p>

<p>Excalidraw started as a way to procrastinate on January 1st, 2020, and ended up being a fully fledged whiteboard product only one year later! In this post, we’ll go over the most important features that made Excalidraw great at being a virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams.</p>
<p>We are so incredibly proud to have built something that is being used by <strong>20k weekly active people</strong>.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<p>Excalidraw is fully open source, but it also stands on the shoulders of many other projects. We couldn’t do it without <a href="https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough">Rough.js</a>, the library that gives Excalidraw its unique look; FG_Virgil, the hand-written font designed by <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/200712.html">Ellinor Rapp</a>; <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript">TypeScript</a>, to tame the complexity of our codebase, giving a helping hand to new contributors (and old ones alike); and last but not least, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>. Our full list of <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/network/dependencies">dependencies</a> is listed on GitHub.</p>
<p>In addition, Excalidraw is depending on many awesome services such as <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> for hosting and pull request previews, <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/excalidraw">Crowdin</a> for managing dozens of translations, <a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox</a> for easy hacking on the project, <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> for error reporting, and <a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/">Dependabot</a> to keep our dependencies up to date.</p>
<p>Finally, this success wouldn’t be possible without you, the over <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/graphs/contributors">100 contributors</a> who helped us ship new features, improvements, and fixes right to production.</p>

<h2>Some of our coolest features</h2>
<h3>🤝 Collaboration</h3>
<p>When the lockdown started, companies all around the world struggled to adapt to remote work. <a href="https://github.com/idlewinn">idlewinn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/petehunt">petehunt</a> <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/879">implemented live collaboration</a> that could be used for interviews, brainstorming, presentations, and more. If you’re curious, we <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/building-excalidraw-p2p-collaboration-feature/">explained how it works in a blog post</a>.</p>

<h3>🇺🇳 Translations</h3>
<p>It was important for us early on to make sure that Excalidraw was translated into many languages so that it could be used all over the world. The <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/638">initial implementation</a> was done by <a href="https://github.com/fernandoalava">fernandoalava</a>, while the automatic integration with our <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/excalidraw">Crowdin project</a> was set up by <a href="https://github.com/lipis">lipis</a>. Support for right-to-left languages was <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1154">implemented</a> soon after by <a href="https://github.com/j-f1">j-f1</a>. To top it off, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/200712.html">Ellinor Rapp</a> designed new font glyphs for several non-latin languages. You can read more <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/enabling-translations/">about how we manage translations on the blog</a>!</p>
<h3>📱 Mobile first</h3>
<p>Touch support and mobile-optimized layout <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/787">was</a> <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/788">first</a> <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/790">added</a> by <a href="https://github.com/j-f1">j-f1</a>. This includes the creation of a toolbar for mobile devices that displays relevant controls while still leaving most of the screen free for the canvas.</p>
<h3>📚 Library</h3>
<p>The library was <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1787">first implemented</a> by <a href="https://github.com/petehunt">petehunt</a>. After adding support for exporting/importing the library, we eventually introduced a public directory where you can share yours. Visit <a href="https://libraries.excalidraw.com/">libraries.excalidraw.com</a> for more.</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally got around to sharing my <a href="https://twitter.com/excalidraw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@excalidraw</a> library of Data Viz charts.

<h3>📊 Excalicharts</h3>
<p>While we aim to keep Excalidraw simple to use, sometimes we hide little easter eggs that you need to find out for yourself (or find some hints by following our <a href="https://twitter.com/excalidraw">Twitter account</a>). For example, you can copy any two-column dataset from a spreadsheet, or comma separated values (CSV) from a text file, and paste them into Excalidraw to quickly produce a chart. The <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1723">first implementation</a> was done by <a href="https://github.com/petehunt">petehunt</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2495">improvements</a> were made by <a href="https://github.com/lipis">lipis</a>.</p>
<h3>🏹 Lines and Arrows</h3>
<p>Possibly the single most complex feature in Excalidraw, lines/arrows have come a long way since the beginning. Initially, we’ve only had two-point lines. Multi-point support was added by <a href="https://github.com/GasimGasimzada">gasimgasimzada</a>, with improvements by <a href="https://github.com/dai-shi">dai-shi</a>, line editing by <a href="https://github.com/dwelle">dwelle</a>, arrowheads by <a href="https://github.com/steveruizok">steveruizok</a>, and by popular demand the arrow binding by <a href="https://github.com/xixixao">xixixao</a>.</p>

<p>Related, the <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1570">free hand drawing</a>, one of the most <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/25">requested</a> features, was implemented by <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis">kbariotis</a>.</p>

<h3>🔄 More powerful editing</h3>
<p>We must give a shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/dai-shi">dai-shi</a> for continuous implementations of seemingly simple, but in fact pretty hard problems such as rotation and resizing, especially in combination of editing multiple elements at once.</p>

<h3>#️⃣ Grid and Stats</h3>
<p>From early on, people were asking for more precision in their hand drawn diagrams. We complied by adding the <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1788">grid support</a> implemented by <a href="https://github.com/dai-shi">dai-shi</a>, and—inspired by <em>YouTube’s stats for nerds</em>—our own version of <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2453">stats</a> implemented by <a href="https://github.com/lipis">lipis</a>. Both features could be found under the context menu by right-clicking on the canvas.</p>
<h3>💾 File system integration and file handling</h3>
<p>In Excalidraw, we use the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/browser-nativefs">browser-nativefs</a> library to integrate with the file system of the operating system. This allows us to support a true open→edit→save workflow with proper over-saving and save-as on supported browsers, with a fallback to file uploads and downloads on other browsers. Read more about this feature in <a href="https://github.com/tomayac">tomayac</a>’s <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/browser-nativefs/">earlier article</a> on this blog. We also have <a href="https://web.dev/file-handling/#demo">experimental support</a> for file type association, so that when you double-click an <code>.excalidraw</code> file in your file explorer, the Excalidraw PWA opens.</p>
<h3>⚙️ Gatsby plugin</h3>
<p>We also have a plugin for Gatsby that automatically converts links to saved Excalidraw drawings to inline SVG at build time. We are actually using it in this post for our charts. Implemented by <a href="https://github.com/trevorblades">trevorblades</a> and <a href="https://github.com/j-f1">j-f1</a>. You can find it under <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/gatsby-embedder-excalidraw">@excalidraw/gatsby-embedder-excalidraw</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excalidraw blog infrastructure is so nice. You can just add a link to the excalidraw url of the illustration and there's a build step that downloads the file, turn it into a svg and embeds the svg directly in the post. <a href="https://t.co/6GUyQot4C9">https://t.co/6GUyQot4C9</a> <a href="https://t.co/8RjoZ34Lwn">pic.twitter.com/8RjoZ34Lwn</a></p>— vjeux ✪ (@Vjeux) <a href="https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/1257906664239333376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h3>🌒 Dark Mode</h3>
<p>To help protect your eyes, <a href="https://twitter.com/xixixao">@xixixao</a> added dark mode, effectively turning Excalidraw into an actual blackboard.</p>
<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you are a «&nbsp;Dark mode&nbsp;» fan and you love <a href="https://twitter.com/excalidraw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@excalidraw</a> 😉 <a href="https://t.co/Ju0JFJWUWS">pic.twitter.com/Ju0JFJWUWS</a></p>— Monsieur_Clean (@Msieur_Jo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Msieur_Jo/status/1245288337897914373?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 1, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h3>📦 npm package</h3>
<p>One of the last things we’ve introduced this year was a completely new npm package, available at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw/excalidraw"><code>@excalidraw/excalidraw</code></a>. A long time in the making (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aakansha1216">@aakansha1216</a> for most of the work), this package allows you to easily embed Excalidraw as a React component into your apps.</p>

January 1, 2021 | https://developers.ibexa.co/blog/embed-flash-swf-content-without-adobe-plugin | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://developers.ibexa.co/blog/embed-flash-swf-content-without-adobe-plugin">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Macromedia (and later Adobe) Flash is&nbsp;a proprietary development platform used for animations, rich web applications and games. Flash was always somewhat controversial, but it did give the world tons of entertainment and was the technology&nbsp;that enabled widespread use of good quality streaming video on the web.</p><div><p>All good things come to an end and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/release-note/fp_32_air_32_release_notes.html" title="">in December 2020</a>, Adobe will stop supporting the Flash Plugin for browsers. While this is a relief for many as the plugin has been plagued by performance and security issues over the years, it also means that decades of content built with Flash and published as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF" title="">SWF</a> (Small Web Format) files will no longer be available for the masses natively via the official flash plugin for browsers.</p><p>It is tragic that such a big piece of our common digital cultural heritage is potentially going to&nbsp;be lost forever by digital erosion. But thankfully the technology has evolved since the time of Flash. The Internet Archive, an organization archiving digital content, have announced that&nbsp;they will <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/" title=""> keep&nbsp;Flash content accessible</a>&nbsp;for future generations.</p><h3>Emulating the Flash plugin in the browser</h3><p>Flash became popular because it could offer more features than the humble web browser. Since that time the web technologies have evolved and it is today possible to implement the Flash plugin functionality <a href="https://malloc.fi/preserve-embed-flash-content-with-javascript" title="">within the browser</a>. You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator" title="">emulators</a> to imitate&nbsp;the functions of an old games console on a new computer to play old games. You can do the same with the Flash plugin and the modern browser capabilities.</p><p>This can be implemented in many ways. These three products achieve it in differently:</p><ul><li>Shumway</li><li>Ruffle</li><li>CheerpX for Flash</li></ul><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Shumway" title="">Shumway</a> was an experimental&nbsp;Flash VM and runtime written in JavaScript. The project was developed by <a href="https://mozilla.org/" title="">Mozilla</a>, and&nbsp;has since been discontinued. Shumway doesn't (always) have great performance or&nbsp;100% compatibility for very complex&nbsp;SWF files, but it runs&nbsp;<a href="https://janit.iki.fi/shit/megacar/" title="">the presentation of Kim Dotcom's Megacar from Cebit 1999</a>&nbsp;acceptably.</p><p><a href="https://ruffle.rs/" title="">Ruffle</a>&nbsp;is a Flash Player emulator written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" title="">Rust</a>. Ruffle is distributed as a&nbsp;<em>wasm</em>&nbsp;executable that <a href="https://caniuse.com/wasm" title="">runs in modern browsers</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://webassembly.org/" title="">WebAssembly</a> is a technology that lower level than JavaScript, and as such seems like the perfect target for running&nbsp;complex applications (like the Flash Plugin emulator) in the browser. It is open, in&nbsp;active development and used by the&nbsp;Internet Archive in their archiving effort.</p><p><a href="https://www.leaningtech.com/pages/cheerpxflash.html" title="">CheerpX for Flash</a>&nbsp;takes a different Approach by virtualizing&nbsp;and running the full Adobe Flash Player in a browser <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)" title="">sandbox</a> using WebAssembly. The advantage is that unlike Shumway or Ruffle, which are re-implementing the Flash Plugin, it offers 100% compatibility with all SWF content. The product is from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leaningtech.com/" title="">Leaning Technologies</a>, a company specializing extending the life of applications with WebAssembly.</p><h3>Digital Erosion is a plague</h3><p>In addition to emulation, there are a number of methods that convert Flash content into web technologies ("Flash-to-HTML5" seems to be the buzzword here). These are also an option, but the emulation method is more practical as it will take any SWF package and execute it as is. I feel emulation is better for preservation as it enables better protection against digital erosion of content that you have, but can't decipher.</p><p>Speaking of availability, this is another important aspect. Erosion of data is by no means new, as we've already gone through many physical formats for digital data like cassettes, magnetic and optical disks and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_storage" title="">solid-state storage</a> like USB Sticks. You may have a physical copy of your data, but can't access it because you don't have a disk to read. Or alternatively the media itself, like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R" title="">recordable CD</a>, may simply <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/04/04/22/1658251/the-myth-of-the-100-year-cd-rom" title="">rot over time</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Physical copies themselves are increasingly hard to obtain. With your data&nbsp;being "in the&nbsp;cloud" you may never have a copy of it. And this may not seem like an issue today with Google and others offering "free storage forever". What if forever ends?&nbsp;It is difficult to see giants like Facebook, Apple or Microsoft faltering but so far in the history of man no empire has lasted forever. It may never&nbsp;be an issue for you, but it might be for the digital archaeologists of the future digging into their analog past.</p><p>But returning to the present day, one era in the history is now ending with the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html" title="">End of Life for Adobe Flash Player</a>. Some will be dancing on the grave of the technology that started as <a href="https://macromedia.fandom.com/wiki/SmartSketch" title="">FutureWave SmartSketch</a> back in 1993. Some will say Steve Jobs himself killed Flash by Apple not supporting it on the iPhone, <a href="https://malloc.fi/pwas-fulfill-promise-of-iphone-for-web-developers" title="">opting for web technologies</a> instead. I certainly won't miss installing or updating the plugin, but what I am certain of is that there is a lot of content built with Flash that is absolutely worth preserving.</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@doctorhulk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">haik ourfal</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/lightning?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

                 <p><span>Dec 22, 2020 </span></p><p>When deciding to work on a side-project three factors are needed to transition from fancy to application: goal, motivation, and time.</p>

<p>Time is usually the biggest sticking point for me personally but with COVID most of what I may have spent my time on this year was cancelled. However, motivation was still a huge sticking point until I came across a couple of projects that helped propel me forward. First, I spent some time earlier this year combing over <a href="https://twitter.com/maryrosecook">Mary Rose Cook</a>‘s lovely <a href="https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp">Little Lisp</a> interpreter code. Given what I knew about Mary’s previous projects it was no surprise that the Little Lisp implementation was simple and elegant. However, what I wasn’t prepared for was that hacking on the interpreter turned out to be straight-forward and addictive. However, it wasn’t until I re-discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/wtaysom">William Taysom</a>‘s old Scheme-like language <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090625142941/http://moonbase.rydia.net/mental/blog/programming/misp-is-a-lisp">Misp</a> that I had a form for the interpreter in mind. At the time of William’s original blog posts about Misp I was drawn to his passion and enjoyed the implementations of the language that he posted.<sup id="fnref:dustbin"><a href="#fn:dustbin" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Around the same time I found Paul Graham’s original Arc tutorial <a href="http://www.arclanguage.org/tut.txt">tut.txt</a> and used it extensively to guide me in what to implement next.<sup id="fnref:readme"><a href="#fn:readme" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> All discussion about Arc aside, I definitely appreciate the clarity and layout of the Arc tutorial and found it a great outline for a little language.</p>

<p>Finally, as some of you might know I <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO?tag=fogus-20">dabbled in functional programming in JavaScript</a> and even went so far as to create a couple of libraries pushing the fringe of fp in js; namely <a href="https://github.com/fogus/lemonad">Lemonad</a> and <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore-contrib">underscore-contrib</a>. Some of the ideas in these libraries found their way into my own interpreter which ultimately pushed my code away from Misp, Little Lisp, and Arc into …something else — that something else I’m calling <strong>Tori Lisp — an ersatz LISP for little birds</strong>.</p>

<center>ToriLisp = Litle Lisp + Misp + tut.txt + Lemonad + underscore-contrib + a pinch of CLJ</center>

<p>Here’s a very small sample of the language:</p>

<pre><code>鳥&gt;  (let (x 3 y 4)
       (+ (* x 2) (* y 2)))
;;=&gt; 14

(def map
  (λ (fn list)
    (if (no list)
      list
      (cons (fn (first list))
            (map fn (rest list))))))

鳥&gt;  (map (+ 10) '(1 2 3))
;;=&gt; [ 11, 12, 13 ]

鳥&gt;  ({x y | (/ (+ x y) 2)} 2 4)
;;=&gt; 3

鳥&gt;  (len "abc")
;;=&gt; 3
鳥&gt;  (len {a | a})
;;=&gt; 1
鳥&gt;  (len +)
;;=&gt; 2

鳥&gt;  (read "(push [1] 'Z)")
;;=&gt; [ "'push", [ "'list", 1 ], [ "'quote", "'Z" ] ]
鳥&gt;  (eval (read "(push [1] 'Z)"))
;;=&gt; [ "'Z", 1 ]  
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted to present a list of features then the following list would work:<sup id="fnref:mac"><a href="#fn:mac" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<ul>
<li>Functional</li>
<li>Immutable access to JavaScript arrays and hash-maps.</li>
<li>Function auto-currying</li>
<li>Function introspection</li>
<li>Bottoms-out at JavaScript structures and functions</li>
<li>ML-like Refs</li>
<li>Lightweight syntax for common language forms</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re interested in checking out the language then the <a href="https://github.com/fogus/tori-lisp">ToriLisp Github repository</a> has a quick start, test suite, and its own tut.txt.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The world’s current and next innovations depend on a single country: Taiwan. It’s probably one country you might never hear about, or perhaps confuse with its neighbor, Thailand, or even think it’s a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Taiwan">China</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been living in Taiwan for 3+ years, and am baffled that I never pay attention to semiconductors. I’m a software engineer but didn’t think much more about the importance of them. As far as my laptop can change code to real things and doesn’t lag when I have constantly <a href="https://erickhun.com/img/tsmc/tabs.jpg">hundred tabs open</a>, I was satisfied.
At a recent <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/">Taiwan Gold Card</a> dinner, one of the speakers introduced himself as someone with 30+ years of experience at IBM, who moved to Taiwan for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC">TSMC</a>. It piqued my curiosity and I started to investigate, to realize how <strong>the world depends on a TSMC for the past decades of innovation, and still be dependant for the next decade</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-world-needs-and-want-better-semiconductors">The world needs (and want) better semiconductors</h2>
<p>Semiconductors have and had a significant impact on our society. They’re everywhere, and essential to any electrical object, from a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">led</a> to a <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/challenges-for-electronic-circuits-in-space-applications.html#">shuttle that can send humanity to Mars</a>.  Without them, you couldn’t read this article, we couldn’t drive cars, and wouldn’t be able to call your family. They are needed to build any electronic devices. TV’s, computers, medical equipment.</p>
<p>We can illustrate with the COVID19 vaccine that was created in less than 6 months, from research to mass production. This would have been impossible a decade ago. Zoom calls over the internet were made to connect researchers. Any new research papers were instantly available to researchers to make progress. Machine Learning was used to sequence the virus DNA. Cutting edge machines were used to prototype any new potential vaccines. Thousands of volunteers were reached instantly to test the vaccines. Then <a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/medical/covid-19-vaccine-manufacture/">millions of vaccines were being manufactured at scale</a>. And this happened in less than 6 months what would have probably taken years a decade ago.</p>
<p>Making those tiny things might sound easy, but making them better, more efficient, and smaller is the real challenge. Without the progress the semiconductor industry has made, we wouldn’t have been where the world is today.  Even if <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software</a> or bigger hardware are the final mean, semiconductors do the real works to enable them to run.</p>
<p>And the future needs semiconductors to be better. We want electronic devices consuming less electricity to save the planet. We want <a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/47379#:~:text=Semiconductors%20play%20a%20key%20role,for%20solar%20electric%20energy%20systems.">clean energy</a> (solar panels &amp; co) and replace fossil energy. We want <a href="https://medium.com/pcmag-access/apple-our-new-arm-based-macs-offer-epic-cpu-performance-and-battery-life-3ccda5e1da11">unlimited battery life for our phone or computer</a>. We want a tinier camera with a higher resolution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_China">spy</a> on citizens of <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/city-of-san-diego-awarded-ge-mass-surveillance-contract-without-oversight/">every country</a>. We want better computer to run IA, to run your <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw">next domestic helper (or terminator?)</a> or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48853230">less resourceful bitcoin miners</a>. We want to space travel. We want […]</p>
<p><em><strong>The one company that changed the game and enabled that technology to progress, and will help everyone’s dream is called TSMC, and they are based in Taiwan</strong></em></p>

<h2 id="isnt-it-just-chips-its-everywhere-it-must-be-simple-to-do">Isn’t it just “chips”? It’s everywhere it must be simple to do</h2>
<p>Not that simple. To understand why TSMC is so essential we should understand first the supply-chain for any end-user electronic devices.</p>
<h3 id="the-supply-chain">The supply chain</h3>
<p>Historically, all electronic selling electronic hardware had a small business unit manufacturing the Integrated Circuit (ICs, or chips). It cost money and time to create them. However those companies didn’t want to waste time to do those chips, so they ask to other big names such as Texas Instrument, or Samsung to help them do them.
But those don’t necessarily have the capacity or willingness to do chips for those competitors. If so, they were often  asking big bucks to design/manufacture them.</p>
<p>This when we started to see the born of semiconductors focused company, only designing/manufacturing those chips. Some of those companies only designed them for the end product company. They’re called Fabless Company. You’ll just need to tell them what you want. TSMC is a bit diffferent. They only manufacture those chips, and you’ll need to give them the design of the chip you want. It is called a “Pure Play Foundry”.</p>
<p>To visualize better and understand who is who, let’s put some names into players of the supply chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>End product company: Amazon (Cloud servers), Sony (Console), Apple (Phones), Tesla (cars), Samsung*, etc…</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_device_manufacturer">IDMs</a> (design and manufacture the ICs): Samsung*, Intel</li>
<li>Fabless (only design chips the ICs and gives to the pure-play foundry for manufacturing): Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom</li>
<li>Pure Play (only manufacture the ICs): TSMC, GlobalFoundry</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*You can notice here that Samsung has the End product, ICs design, and manufacturing abilities</em></p>
<p>Designing a chip has its own quirks, and burden. You can see it could cost <a href="https://semiengineering.com/big-trouble-at-3nm/">up to $1.5 billions dollars</a> to design one:
<img src="https://erickhun.com/img/tsmc/design-chips-nano3-ibs.png" alt=" semiconductor fab breakeven"></p>
<p>Again, TSMC only manufactures chips and avoid the design cost. So just manufacturing  must be easy, isn’t it?  This is what I was also thinking, until I dig deeper into the subject.  <em>The hardest part is actually to manufacture the Integrated Circuit (ICs, or chips)</em>. Today only 2 companies doing it at the state of the art: TSMC and Samsung.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-so-hard">Why is it so hard?</h3>
<p>To create smaller and smaller chips, TSMC uses today an extremely difficult process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography">Extreme ultraviolet lithography</a> (or EUV). The machine enabling this litography process is provided by a company called <a href="https://www.asml.com/">ASML</a>. The machine has to basically create a new way to make light. The process is to drip molten tin into a chamber, and hit it with a laser to create a bright light/plasma that can make it through the series of mirrors and masks to the wafers (chips). And it happens 50,000 times a minute. Some agree that this machine might probably be the most complicated machine humankind has ever engineered - more difficult than putting a man on the moon. This kind of machine costs itself $120 million US dollar. 1 machine weight 180 tonnes, with the size of a double-decker bus. A  mindblowing part is that <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly">ASML sources from 5000 vendors to make its EUV machines</a>.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>So wouldn’t just getting the ASML machine enough to take over TSMC? Not that easy. It’s not only ASML lithography machines, but other types of equipment that come into play that come into play. ASML’s lithography is only 10% of the manufacturing process (but 20% of the total costs). TSMC needs to learn how to operate each equipment together, and every single equipment has their own quirks, faults, and tolerances. Having to chain all the equipment together, into a high volume manufacturing process, is a problem of itself.</p>
<p>Put simply is ASML sells the pots and TSMC sells the cooking. Cooking is very hard. Each takes a lifetime of specialty to get to the top of the field, it’s hard to be good at both. And everything is done with an army of people. People who make chef knives are probably not Michelin star chefs. The machines that ASML builds as simply a tool to which they are the only ones who have been able to solve a specific set of problems. A nice hammer still needs a skilled craftsman to use it.</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-minimizing-faults-and-research--development">The importance of minimizing faults, and Research &amp; Development</h3>
<p>Getting the fewest “defects” as possible is the biggest challenge for the manufacturer. This is probably the main focus for the chips manufacturers, and where TSMC excels. The percent of chips found to perform properly is referred to as the yield. If you manufacture chips, but more than 60% of the chips are faulty, this wouldn’t be great when you’ll need to scale. Those failures can be caused for multiple reasons. Some because of tiny imperfections, others caused of alignment and patterning issues.</p>
<p>The yield is why so much money is poured by the manufacturers into Research and Development. You want to get the highest yield possible, to be able to scale to <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/english/news-events/blog-article-20200801">billions of chips</a> to satisfy your customers. Each year,  TMSC’s customers ask for smaller, and better chips (especially Apple). The process to make them needs to be refined, and new equipments to support those new process are constantly needed. <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3954592">TSMC invested in 2019 3 billions dollar</a> into R&amp;D, and plan to invest more in 2020.  Would any other company would have the budget to do that?</p>
<p>Today’s TSMC’s monopoly is probably the result of a 40 years relationships with partners, with tight relationship and trust between each others.</p>

</p>

<h3 id="why-companies-prefer-to-use-tsmc-over-others">Why companies prefer to use TSMC over others?</h3>
<p><strong>It’s all about trust</strong>. TSMC and its founder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEh3ZgbvBrE">Morris Chang</a> is well respected for <a href="https://www.tsmc.com/english/aboutTSMC/values">its integrity</a> and being impeccable about it. Companies trust them, and they have a well known clause of non-competitivity with anyone choosing them. When hearing about customers, you’ll likely to hear love stories about people having the chance to work with them and how awesome is TSMC.</p>
<p>Trust that the foundry will not compete unfairly with you. Trust that the foundry will deliver the PPA (power/performance/area). TSMC was impeccable on those 2 points since it was created. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co">Apple had legal issues with Samsung</a> when Apple asked them to manufacture their chips. They won’t likely get back to them for this reason.</p>
<p>The other strength of TSMC is probably their inner circle of partners. They a massive ecosystem of partners and customers who together spend trillions of dollars on research and development for the greater good of the fabless semiconductor ecosystem. There is also an inner circle of partners and customers that TSMC intimately collaborates with on new process development and deployment. Including Apple, AMD, ARM or ASML. Sourcing the right partners that will help with the correct equipment for making. They work closely  to improve everyone’s process and together partners together spend trillions of dollars on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Trust toward TSMC is proably the main reason why companies that needs chips will prefer TSMC over others.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-just-do-an-other-tsmc">Why not just do an other TSMC?</h2>
<p>It is not as simple. Every year, billions of US dollars are poured into R&amp;D to keep their advantages. Then production facilities costs billions to build:</p>
<ul>
<li>TSMC last production facility (Fab18) to manufacture <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/tsmc-building-fab-18-5nm-production/">the newest technology 5nm chips cost …</a></li></ul></div></div>

<h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2>



<div><p>The Lichee Nano Pi is a $6 Linux Development board powered by an Allwinner F1C100s ARM9 Processor. The Lichee Nano Pi features 32MB DDR integrated into SoC, a 16MB SPI Flash, an onboard TF Slot, and is able to be booted from a TF card.&nbsp;It is around the size of an SD card.</p><p>Whilst there are Linux images available for the Lichee Nano Pi it is recommended to use buildroot to build a very lightweight Linux install. There are some instructions on doing that here: <a href="https://github.com/unframework/licheepi-nano-buildroot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/unframework/licheepi-nano-buildroot </a></p><p>Buildroot is great for creating a light weight Linux install I wanted to see if I could run full Debian 10 on this tiny SBC. As there are no Debian images available for this board I had to get creative. </p></div>



<h2><span id="Building_a_Debian_Image"></span>Building a Debian Image <span></span></h2>



<p>If you would prefer to skip this and use a pre-built SD card click <a href="#Debian_SD_Card_image">here</a>. </p>



<p>Starting by downloading a Linux image designed for the Lichee Pi here: <a href="https://steward-fu.github.io/website/mcu/lichee-nano/flash_image.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://steward-fu.github.io/website/mcu/lichee-nano/flash_image.htm</a></p>



<p>I then flashed this to a micro SD card and expanded the rootfs partition from ~183MB to 1GB. I then removed the contents of the rootfs partition and created a Debian rootfs using multistrap:</p>



<div><p>We then need to create the multistrap config I created a file called buster.conf as follows:</p></div>



<pre><code>[General]
unpack=true
bootstrap=Debian
aptsources=Debian

[Debian]
packages=
source=http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian
keyring=debian-archive-keyring
suite=buster
</code></pre>



<p>Then I ran the following: <br></p>



<pre><code>multistrap -a armel -f buster.conf -d path/to/sd/card/mount
</code></pre>



<p>This created a bootable half finished Debian install, I then booted this up on the Lichee nano and connected using my <a href="https://amzn.to/3o5uSyN">DSD TECH USB to TTL Serial adapter</a> and ran the following to finish setting up the packages: <br></p>



<pre><code>dpkg --configure -a</code></pre>



<p>This gave me a somewhat working install of Debian however no init system is included, I wanted to run full systemd and include a few packages. </p>



<p>The easiest way to do this without networking was to use debootstrap, on my Linux desktop I ran the following: <br></p>



<pre><code>mkdir lichee_packages &amp;&amp; debootstrap  --arch=armel --include=htop,procps,zsh,nano,systemd,isc-dhcp-client,ifupdown stable lichee_packages</code></pre>



<div><p>This outputs a full chroot environment into the directory lichee_packages however I only wanted the .deb packages. </p><p>I ran the following to copy the .deb packages to the Lichee Nano’s SD Card: </p></div>



<pre><code>cp lichee_packages/var/cache/apt/archive/*.deb /path/to/mounted/sd/card/root/</code></pre>



<p>I then inserted the SD card into the Lichee Nano and booted it once again and installed the packages as follows: <br></p>



<pre><code>dpkg -i /root/*.deb</code></pre>



<div><p>This took a few minutes to complete although once finished I have a fully working Debian 10 install on my Lichee Nano. </p><p>I then created a swap file as 32MB of RAM does not go far!: </p></div>

    <p>A design system for building faithful recreations of old UIs.</p>

      </a>
    </p>

    <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
    <p>
      7.css is a CSS framework for building interface components that look like Windows 7.
      It is built on top of the GUI backbone of <a href="https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css">XP.css</a>,
      which is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/jdan/98.css">98.css</a>.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      This framework relies on the usage of <strong>semantic HTML</strong>. To make a button, you'll need
      to use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on
      <code>aria-label</code>. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary
      goal of this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can override many of the styles of your elements while maintaining the appearance provided by
      this framework. Need more padding on your buttons? Go for it. Need to add some color to your input labels?
      Be our guest.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>This framework does not contain any JavaScript</strong>, it merely styles your HTML with some CSS.
      This means 7.css is compatible with your frontend framework of choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fastest way to use 7.css is to import it from unpkg.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/7.css"&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      You can also install 7.css <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/7.css">from npm</a>.
    </p>
    <p><em>Installation</em></p>
    <pre>npm install 7.css</pre>

    <p><em>Usage</em></p>
    <pre>import "7.css/dist/7.css";</pre>

    <section>
      <h3 id="button">Button</h3>
      <div>
        <blockquote>
          A <em>command button</em>, also referred to as a push button, is a control
          that causes the application to perform some action when the user clicks it.

          
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          A standard button measures 75px wide and 23px tall with 12px of horizontal padding by default.
          They are styled with 2 shades of gray as a vertical gradient.
        </p>

        <div>
      <details>
        <summary>Show code</summary>
        <pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span>&gt;</span>Click me<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
      </details>
    </div>

          <p>
            When buttons are clicked, the gray gradient is shifted to corresponding sky blues.
            The following button is simulated to be in the pressed (active) state.
          </p>

      </details>
    </div>

              <p>
                Disabled buttons maintain the same style, but have a "washed out"
                appearance in their label.
              </p>

              <div>

        <summary>Show code</summary>

      </details>
    </div>

                <p>
                  Button focus is communicated with a dotted border, set 4px within the contents of the button.
                  The following example is simulated to be focused.
                </p>

    <section>
      <h3 id="checkbox">CheckBox</h3>
      <div>
        <blockquote>
          A <em>check box</em> represents an independent or non-exclusive choice.
          
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Checkboxes are represented with a sunken panel, populated with a "check" icon when
          selected, next to a label indicating the choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: You <strong>must</strong> include a corresponding label <strong>after</strong>
          your checkbox, using the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element with a <code>for</code> attribute
          pointed at the <code>id</code> of your input. This ensures the checkbox is easy to use with
          assistive technologies, on top of ensuring a good user experience for all (navigating with the tab key,
          being able to click the entire label to select the box).
        </p>

        <div>
      <p>
<label for="example1">This is a checkbox</label></p><details>

      </details>
    </div>

          <p>
            Checkboxes can be selected and disabled with the standard <code>checked</code> and <code>disabled</code>
            attributes.
          </p>

          <p>
            When grouping inputs, wrap each input in a container with the <code>field-row</code> class. This ensures
            a consistent spacing between inputs.
          </p>

          the value.

        <p>
          Dropdowns can be rendered by using the <code>select</code> and <code>option</code>
          elements.

            attribute.

        <p>
          A group box can be used by wrapping your elements with the <code>fieldset</code> tag.
          It contains a sunken outer border and a raised inner border, resembling an engraved box

        <blockquote>
          An <em>option button</em>, also referred to as a radio button, represents a single
          choice within a limited set of mutually exclusive choices. That is, the user can choose only
          one set of options.

          
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Option buttons can be used via the <code>radio</code> type on an input element.
        </p>

        <p>
          Option buttons can be grouped by specifying a shared <code>name</code> attribute on each
          input. Just as before: when grouping inputs, wrap each input in a container with the
          <code>field-row</code> class to ensure a consistent spacing between inputs.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">sparse matrix</a> is a matrix that has a value of 0 for most elements.
If the ratio of <b>N</b>umber of <b>N</b>on-<b>Z</b>ero (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.spmatrix.getnnz.html">NNZ</a>) elements to the size is less than 0.5, the matrix is sparse.
While this is the mathematical definition, I will be using the term sparse for matrices with only NNZ elements and dense for matrices with all elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://matteding.github.io/images/sparse_dense.gif" alt="Sparse vs Dense"></p>

<p>Storing information about all the 0 elements is inefficient, so we will assume unspecified elements to be 0.
Using this scheme, sparse matrices can perform faster operations and use less memory than its corresponding dense matrix representation, which is especially important when working with large data sets in data science.</p>

<p>Today we will investigate all of the different implementations provided by the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html">SciPy sparse package</a>.
This implementation is modeled after <code>np.matrix</code> opposed to <code>np.ndarray</code>, thus is restricted to 2-D arrays and having quirks like <code>A * B</code> doing matrix multiplication instead of element-wise multiplication.</p>

<h2 id="construction-matrices">Construction Matrices</h2>
<p>Different sparse formats have their strengths and weaknesses.
A good starting point is looking at formats that are efficient for constructing these matrices.
Typically you would start with one of these forms and then convert to another when ready to do calculations.</p>

<h3 id="coordinate-matrix">Coordinate Matrix</h3>
<p>Perhaps the simplest sparse format to understand is the <b>COO</b>rdinate (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html">COO</a>) format.
This variant uses three subarrays to store the element values and their coordinate positions.</p>

<p>The savings on memory consumption is quite substantial as the matrix size increases.
Managing data in a sparse structure is a fixed cost unlike the case for dense matrices.
The overhead incurred from needing to manage the subarrays is becomes negligible as data grows making it a great choice for some datasets.</p>

<p>A word of caution: only use sparse arrays if they are sufficiently sparse enough; it would be counterproductive storing a mostly nonzero array using several subarrays to keep track of position and data.</p>

is very much like COO except that it subclasses <code>dict</code> to store coordinate-data information as key-value pairs.
Since it uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> as storage, identifying values at any given location has constant lookup time.
Use this format if you need the functionality that come with builtin dictionaries, but be mindful that hash tables hog much more memory than arrays.</p>

<h3 id="linked-list-matrix">Linked List Matrix</h3>

<p>The most flexible format to insert data is through usage of <b>LI</b>nked <b>L</b>ist (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.lil_matrix.html">LIL</a>) matrices.
Data can be set via <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.indexing.html">indexing and slicing</a> syntax of NumPy to quickly populate the matrix.
In my opinion, LIL is the coolest sparse format for constructing sparse matrices from scratch.</p>

<p><img src="https://matteding.github.io/images/lil.gif" alt="LIL Matrix"></p>

<p>LIL stores information in <code>lil.rows</code> where each list represents a row index and the elements inside the list match columns.
In a parallel array, <code>lil.data</code>, the NNZ values are stored.
But unlike other sparse formats, these subarrays <em>cannot</em> be explicitly passed to the constructor; LIL matrices must be made from either an empty state or from existing matrices, dense or sparse.
Below is an illustration of various techniques used to build up a LIL matrix.</p>

<p>So what’s the drawback…? Well, it utilizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array">jagged arrays</a> under the hood which requires <code>np.dtype(object)</code>.
This costs a lot more memory than a rectangular array, so if the data is big enough, you may be forced to work with COO instead of LIL.
In short, LIL is mostly offered as a convenience, albeit an awesome one at that.</p>

<p>As an aside, Linked List Matrix is a misnomer since it does <em>not</em> use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked lists</a> behind the scenes!
LIL actually uses Python’s <code>list</code> which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">dynamic array</a>, so it should really be called a List of Lists Matrix, in spite of what the documentation says.
(A missed opportunity to christen it as LOL…)</p>

<h2 id="compressed-sparse-matrices">Compressed Sparse Matrices</h2>
<p>The formats described earlier are great for building sparse matrices, but they aren’t as computationally performant than more specialized forms.
The reverse is true for compressed sparse matrix family, which should be treated as read-only rather than write-only.
These are more difficult to understand, but with a little patience their structure can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grokked</a>.</p>

<p>Adjacent pairs of index pointers determine two things.
First, their position in the pointer array is the row number.
Second, these values represent the [start:stop] slice of the indices array, and their difference is the NNZ elements in each row.
Using the pointers, look up the indices to determine the column for each element in the data.</p>

<p>CSC works exactly the same as CSR but has column based index pointers and row indices instead.
Below is a diagram of the same data in this format.
Notice for this particular case, CSC is slightly more compact with two fewer index pointers.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/osnr/TabFS">TabFS</a> is a browser extension that
mounts your browser tabs as a filesystem on your computer.</p>

<p>Out of the box, it supports Chrome and (to a lesser extent<sup id="fnref:firefox"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:firefox">1</a></sup>)
Firefox, on macOS and Linux.<sup id="fnref:otherbrowsers"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:otherbrowsers">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Each of your open tabs is mapped to a folder.</p>

they map to 3 folders in TabFS</p>
</div>

<p>The files inside a tab's folder directly reflect (and can control) the
state of that tab in your browser. (TODO: update as I add more)</p>

<p>Example: the url.txt, text.txt, and title.txt
files inside a tab's folder, which tell me those live properties
for that tab</p>
</div>

<p>This gives you a <em>ton</em> of power, because now you can apply <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1018570020324962305">all the
existing tools</a>
on your computer that already know how to deal with files -- terminal

communicate with your browser.</p>

<p>Now you don't need to <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1261392522485526528">code up a browser extension from
scratch</a> every
time you want to do anything. You can write a script that talks to
your browser in, like, a melange of Python and bash, and you can save
it as <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1308588645872435202">a single ordinary
file</a> that you
can run whenever, and it's no different from scripting any other part
of your computer.</p>

<p>(now... how would you do this <em>without</em> TabFS?  I honestly have no
idea, off the top of my head. like, how do you even get the titles of
tabs? how do you tell the browser to close them?)</p>

<p>(I looked up the APIs, and, OK, if you're already in a browser
extension, in a 'background script' inside the extension, <em>and</em> your
extension has the <code>tabs</code> permission -- this already requires you to
make 2 separate files and hop between your browser and your text
editor to set it all up! -- you can do
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-query">this</a>:
<code>chrome.tabs.query({}, tabs =&gt; chrome.tabs.remove(tabs.filter(tab =&gt;
tab.title.includes('Stack Overflow')).map(tab =&gt; tab.id)))</code>)</p>

<p>(not <em>terrible</em>, but look at all that upfront overhead to get it set
up. and it's not all that discoverable. and what if you want to reuse
this later, or plug it into some larger pipeline of tools on your
computer, or give it a visual interface? the jump in complexity once
you need to communicate with anything -- possibly setting up a
WebSocket, setting up handlers and a state machine -- is pretty
horrifying)</p>

<h3 id="reload-an-extension-when-you-edit-its-source-code">Reload an extension when you edit its source code</h3>

<p>Suppose you're working on a Chrome extension (apart from this
one). It's a pain to reload the extension (and possibly affected Web
pages) every time you change its code. There's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2963260/how-do-i-auto-reload-a-chrome-extension-im-developing">Stack Overflow
post</a>
with ways to automate this, but they're all sort of hacky. You need
yet another extension, or you need to tack weird permissions onto your
work-in-progress extension, and you don't just get a command you can
trigger from your editor or shell to refresh the extension.</p>

<p>TabFS lets you do all this in <a href="https://github.com/osnr/playgroundize-devtools-protocol/blob/main/go.sh">an ordinary shell
script</a>.
You don't have to write any browser-side code at all.</p>

<p>This script turns an extension (this one's title is "Playgroundize
DevTools Protocol") off, then turns it back on, then reloads any tabs
that have the relevant pages open (in this case, I decided it's tabs
whose titles start with "Chrome Dev"):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -eux
echo false &gt; mnt/extensions/Playg*/enabled
echo true &gt; mnt/extensions/Playg*/enabled
echo reload | tee mnt/tabs/by-title/Chrome_Dev*/control
</code></pre>

<p>I mapped this script to Ctrl-. in my text editor, and now I just hit
that every time I want to reload my extension code.</p>

<h3 id="todo-live-edit-a-running-web-page">TODO: Live edit a running Web page</h3>

<p>edit <code>page.html</code> in the tab folder. I guess it could just stomp
outerHTML at first, eventually could do something more sophisticated</p>

<p>(it would be cool to have a persistent storage story here
also. I like the idea of being able to put arbitrary files anywhere in
the subtree, actually, because then you could use git and emacs
autosave and stuff for free... hmm)</p>

<h3 id="todo-watch-expressions">TODO: Watch expressions</h3>

<pre><code>$ touch mnt/tabs/last-focused/watches/window.scrollY
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can <code>cat window.scrollY</code> and see where you are scrolled on the
page at any time.</p>

<p>Could make an <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1080878682275803137">ad-hoc
dashboard</a>
around a Web page: a bunch of terminal windows floating around your
screen, each sitting in a loop and using <code>cat</code> to monitor a different
variable.</p>

<h3 id="todo-import-data-json-xls-js">TODO: Import data (JSON? XLS? JS?)</h3>

<p>drag a JSON file <code>foo.json</code> into the <code>imports</code> subfolder of the tab
and it shows up as the object <code>imports.foo</code> in JS. (modify
<code>imports.foo</code> in JS and then read <code>imports/foo.json</code> and you read the
changes back?)</p>

<p>import a plotting library or whatever the same way? dragging
<code>plotlib.js</code> into <code>imports/plotlib.js</code> and then calling
<code>imports.plotlib()</code> to invoke that JS file</p>

<p>the browser has a lot of potential power as an interactive programming
environment, one where graphics come <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1295828978477932544">as
naturally</a> as
console I/O do in most programming languages. i think something that
holds it back that is underexplored is lack of ability to just... drag
files in and manage them with decent tools. many Web-based 'IDEs' have
to reinvent file management, etc from scratch, and it's like a
separate universe from the rest of your computer, and migrating
between one and the other is a real pain (if you want to use some
Python library to munge some data and then have a Web-based
visualization of it, for instance, or if you want to version files
inside it, or make snapshots so you <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1288725175895068673">feel
comfortable</a>
trying stuff, etc).</p>

<p>(what would the persistent storage story here be? localStorage? it's
interesting because I almost want each tab to be <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1344753559007420416">less of a
commodity</a>,
less
<a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1270192308772691968">disposable</a>,
since now it's the site I'm dragging stuff to and it might have some
persistent state attached. like, if I'm programming and editing stuff
and saving inside a tab's folder, that tab suddenly really
<a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1251863115022491653">matters</a>; I
want it to survive as long as a normal file would, unlike most browser
tabs today)</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p><strong>disclaimer</strong>: this extension is an experiment. I think it's cool and
useful and provocative, and I usually leave it on, but I make no
promises about functionality or, especially, security. applications
may freeze, your browser may freeze, there may be ways for Web pages
to use the extension to escape and hurt your computer ... In some
sense, the <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1338932056743546880">whole
point</a> of this
extension is to create a gigantic new surface area of communication
between stuff inside your browser and software on the rest of your
computer.</p>

<p>Before doing anything, clone <a href="https://github.com/osnr/TabFS">this repository</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/osnr/TabFS.git
</code></pre>

<p>First, install the browser extension.</p>

<p>Then, install the C filesystem.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-browser-extension">1. Install the browser extension</h3>

<p>(I think for Opera or whatever other Chromium-based browser, you could
get it to work, but you'd need to change the native messaging path in
install.sh. Not sure about Safari. maybe Edge too? if you also got
everything to compile for Windows)</p>

<h4 id="in-chrome">in Chrome</h4>

<p>Go to the <a href="chrome://extensions">Chrome extensions page</a>. Enable
Developer mode (top-right corner).</p>

<p>Load-unpacked the <code>extension/</code> folder in this repo.</p>

<p><strong>Make a note of the extension ID Chrome assigns.</strong> Mine is
<code>jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj</code>. We'll use this later.</p>

<h4 id="in-firefox">in Firefox</h4>

<p>You'll need to install as a "temporary extension", so it'll only last
in your current FF session. (TODO: is this fixable? signature stuff?)</p>

<p>Go to <a href="about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox">about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</a>.</p>

<p>Load Temporary Add-on...</p>

<p>Choose manifest.json in the extension subfolder of this repo.</p>

<h3 id="2-install-the-c-filesystem">2. Install the C filesystem</h3>

<p>First, make sure you have FUSE and FUSE headers. On Linux, for example,
<code>sudo apt install libfuse-dev</code> or equivalent. On macOS, get <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">FUSE for
macOS</a>. (on macOS, also check <a href="https://github.com/osnr/TabFS/issues/11">this
bug</a> -- TODO work out the
best path to explain here.)</p>

<p>Then compile the C filesystem:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd fs
$ mkdir mnt
$ make
</code></pre>

<p>(GNU Make is required, so use gmake on FreeBSD)</p>

<p>Now install the native messaging host into your browser, so the
extension can launch and talk to the filesystem:</p>

<h4 id="chrome-and-chromium">Chrome and Chromium</h4>

<p>Substitute the extension ID you copied earlier for
<code>jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj</code> in the command below.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./install.sh chrome jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ ./install.sh chromium jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj
</code></pre>

<h4 id="firefox">Firefox</h4>

<pre><code>$ ./install.sh firefox
</code></pre>

<h3 id="3-ready">3. Ready!</h3>

<p>Go back to <code>chrome://extensions</code> or
<code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> and reload the extension.</p>

<p>Now your browser tabs should be mounted in <code>fs/mnt</code>!</p>

<p>Open the background page inspector to see the filesystem operations
stream in. (in Chrome, click "background page" next to "Inspect views"
in the extension's entry in the Chrome extensions page; in Firefox,
click "Inspect")</p>

    <p>This article is a comprehensive guide to the <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno106.php">Roland Juno</a>'s <strong>digitally-controlled analog oscillators</strong> (<em>DCOs</em>). I fell in love with the Juno early in my synthesizer journey and I've spent the last year or so doing research on its design so that I could create my own Juno-inspired DCO, <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-castor-and-pollux">Winterbloom's <em>Castor &amp; Pollux</em></a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Juno logo" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/juno-logo.png"></p>
<p>This article will cover a little history of the Juno, discuss the theory of operation behind digital-controlled oscillators, analyze the circuit designs for the Juno 6/60 &amp; the Juno 106, and discuss practical aspects of using DCOs. This article is somewhat lengthy and there is a <em>lot</em> of information here. I've tried my best to make this approachable for anyone with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/engineering_essentials">basic electronics knowledge</a>, so if you feel confused or overwhelmed please <a href="mailto:me@thea.codes">reach out</a> and I'll be more than happy to include more details or change something so that it's easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>
<p>Roland introduced the incredible <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno6.php">Juno-6</a> and nearly identical <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno60.php">Juno-60</a> in 1982. The Juno was a 6-voice polyphonic synthesizer that was an incredible value considering its array of features.</p>
<p><img alt="A photo of the Juno-60" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/juno-60.jpg"></p>
<p>The Juno notably featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitally_controlled_oscillator"><em>digitally-controlled analog oscillators</em></a>. The DCO was designed to overcome the tuning instability of the usual <strong>voltage-controlled oscillators</strong> (<em>VCOs</em>) in contemporary polyphonic synthesizers. The DCOs operate with the same fundamental analog circuitry but differ in that they are controlled by a microcontroller. This imparted a unique sound to the Juno series and one that's become a favorite of many musicians.</p>
<p><img alt="A photo of the Juno 106" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/juno-106.jpg"></p>
<p>Roland followed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-106">Juno-106</a> in 1984. It offered some feature upgrades over its predecessor such as pitch bend, modulation, and support for a new thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a>. It still used the same digitally-controlled oscillator concept from the 6 &amp; 60, but its implementation is a little bit different.</p>
<p>This article will discuss and analyze both designs, but before getting into the nitty-gritty details let's take a look at the overall sound generation design of the Juno. Also, this article will refer to these three synthesizers - the 6, 60, and 106 - as <strong>the Juno</strong>, but note that this isn't necessarily applicable to later models.</p>
<h2 id="an-overview-of-the-junos-sound-generation">An overview of the Juno's sound generation</h2>
<p>The Juno has six voices. Each voice has a single oscillator that can generate three different <em>waveforms</em>. These oscillators are controlled by the microcontroller. Here's a block diagram that should help visualize the different parts at play:</p>
<p><img alt="A block diagram of a DCO-based synth" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/dco-block.png"></p>
<p>Sound generation starts with a <em>square</em> wave controlled by the microntroller and then goes through a series of <em>waveshapers</em> which generates a <em>ramp/sawtooth</em> waveform, a <em>sub</em> waveform (which is a square wave at half the frequency), and a <em>pulse</em> waveform. The frequency of the clock determines the frequency/note that the oscillator plays.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to a common design for a voltage-controlled oscillator (<em>VCO</em>) where a CPU isn't required. Instead, it uses analog circuitry to create a <em>control voltage</em> which determines the oscillator's frequency:</p>
<p><img alt="A block diagram of a VCO-based synth" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/vco-block.png"></p>
<p>Now that you've got a high-level overview of the sound generation inside of these synthesizers, let's take a deeper look at the components involved in sound generation.</p>
<h2 id="the-ramp-generator">The ramp generator</h2>
<p>Before jumping into the difference between DCOs and VCOs it's useful to discuss the similarities. As shown in the block diagrams above several designs for VCOs <strong>and</strong> the Juno DCOs are designed around a <strong>ramp generator</strong> (sometimes referred to as a <em>ramp core</em>) which creates a <em>sawtooth</em> (ramp) waveform:</p>
<p><img alt="A sawtooth waveform" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/ramp.png"></p>
<p>The ramp generator is the beginning of how an oscillator turns a <em>frequency input signal</em> into the various useful waveforms that are used to make musical sounds. For a VCO, the frequency input signal is a <strong>control voltage</strong>, hence "voltage-controlled". For a DCO, the frequency input signal is a <strong>digital clock</strong>, hence "digitally-controlled".</p>
<p>The difference in the type of input signal has a significant impact on the circuit design. Before getting into those differences, let's look at the heart of the ramp generator that's shared between both designs: the <strong>integrator</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-integrator">The integrator</h2>
<p>An integrator is a electronic circuit that performs the mathematical operation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"><em>Integration</em></a>. This is a fancy word from calculus but don't be afraid- it's actually pretty straightforward in practice.</p>
<p>The purpose of an integrator is to produce an output signal that changes (increase or decreases) at a rate that corresponds to the magnitude and duration of the input signal. In this case the input and output signals are both voltage. If you apply a <strong>constant</strong> voltage to an integrator, it will create a consistent increase or decrease in the output voltage over time (a <em>ramp</em>):</p>
<p><img alt="An ideal integrator" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-ramp.png"></p>
<p>More voltage means that the ramp will have a steeper slope. This is going to be helpful in generating a sawtooth waveform- the integrator ramp produces exactly one cycle of a sawtooth waveform. The trick is getting it to restart so that it creates a repeating (or <em>periodic</em>) sawtooth waveform.</p>
<p>You can create an integrator using an <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_6.html">op-amp integrator circuit</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="A basic op-amp integrator circuit" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/op-amp-integrator.png"></p>
<p>The op-amp integrator is based on the idea that if you apply a voltage to a capacitor it <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/capchg.html">takes some time to charge</a>, in fact, it will charge at a rate that is proportional to the input voltage which sounds a <em>lot</em> like integration! Without going into too much op-amp theory, you can just assume that the integrator circuit will produce a voltage that increases or decreases at a rate determined by the input voltage and the values of <code>R</code> and <code>C</code>. The values of <code>R</code> and <code>C</code> determine the <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc_1.html"><strong>RC constant</strong></a> of the integrator - or put more simply, <em>how long it takes the circuit to charge up</em>. Remember this concept because it comes into play a <em>lot</em> in this article.</p>
<p>You can play around this with interactive illustration to see how changing the voltage, resistance, or capacitance changes the output of the integrator:</p>
<canvas id="integrator" width="1000" height="600"></canvas>


<p>The formula used to determine the output voltage of an integrator with a constant input voltage at a given time is:</p>
<pre><span>Vout</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>(</span><span>Vin</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>R</span> <span>*</span> <span>C</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>
</pre>
<p>Before going further, there are some interesting and noteworthy properties of the integrator's behavior to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, notice that there are three ways of changing the steepness of the output's slope: changing the capacitance, changing the resistance, or changing the voltage. Making the voltage higher will charge the capacitor more quickly and increase the steepness of the slope. Making the resistance or capacitance lower will also cause the capacitor to charge more quickly and will increase the steepness of the slope.</li>
<li>Second, the output is <strong>inverted</strong> - a positive input voltage creates a downward slope and a negative input voltage creates an upward slope. This will come into play when we look at the difference between the Juno-6/60 design and the Juno-106 design.</li>
<li>Third, notice that with steeper slopes the output will <em>saturate</em> (stop increasing or decreasing). This is because a real op amp doesn't have an infinite amount of voltage to output and the capacitor can't hold an infinite amount of charge, so when either the output voltage is beyond the op amp's power supply or the capacitor can't hold any more charge the output voltage will saturate.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you should hopefully have a good grasp on how an op-amp integrator forms a ramp from a constant input voltage. So now we'll see how to change the circuit so that instead of a single slope it generates a repeating (periodic) sawtooth waveform.</p>
<p>A straightforward solution is to just start the circuit over - <strong>reset</strong> it. That'll start the ramp back at zero and let it start rising (or falling) again. If you keep resetting at regular intervals the circuit will keep generating ramps and which form cycles of the sawtooth waveform.</p>
<p>But what does it mean to reset a circuit? Well, it means to put it back into its initial state. Think about what <em>changes</em> in the integrator circuit over time: the <strong>charge</strong> of the capacitor. When the circuit first starts the capacitor has no charge and the output voltage is zero, but, as time goes on the capacitor charges more and more. So resetting the circuit means <em>discharging</em> the capacitor.</p>
<p>The easiest way to discharge a capacitor is to <em>short</em> it: connect its two leads together so there's nothing blocking it from discharging. You can do that by putting a little switch in the circuit:</p>
<p><img alt="An op-amp integrator with a switch to discharge the capacitor" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-with-switch.png"></p>
<p>When the switch is open the integrator behaves the same as before - its output goes up or down depending on the input voltage. When the switch is closed, it creates a circuit that connects the capacitor's leads and allows it to discharge:</p>
<p><img alt="An op-amp integrator with a switch to discharge the capacitor" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-with-switch-closed.png"></p>
<p>Once the switch is opened again the integrator starts over and begins ramping its output again.</p>
<p>Try out the little simulation below - press <code>start</code> to let the capacitor charge for a little bit and then press <code>close switch</code> to reset it:</p>
<canvas id="discharge" width="1000" height="600"></canvas>


<p>Take notice that when you press the button at consistent intervals the output is a sawtooth waveform and its frequency is determined by how often you press the button and reset the capacitor.</p>
<p>Obviously there aren't any synthesizers out there that require you to manually tap a switch at the desired note's frequency!<sup id="fnref:fast"><a href="#fn:fast">1</a></sup> So instead of requiring a person to press a switch this circuit should take some form of <strong>frequency input signal</strong> and use it to electronically close the switch.</p>
<p>The switch is the easy part - there's a well-known component that can act as an <em>electronically-controlled switch</em>: the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors/all">transistor</a>. So, the ramp generator will use a transistor in place of the switch:</p>
<p><img alt="An op-amp integrator with a transistor to discharge the capacitor" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-with-transistor.png"></p>
<p>Note that I am explicitly not specifying which kind of transistor (PNP, NPN etc)- which one you choose depends on a few other factors so for now I'll keep it abstract. Notice that there's also a new resistor there between the capacitor and the transistor. This is generally a low-value resistor and it's just there to limit the current that goes through the transistor when the capacitor discharges as too much current could damage the transistor.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom's Brexit transition period expired at 11pm last night, ending a 48-year history with the European project.</p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/1228/1186705-brexit-eu/" target="_blank">trading rules now apply</a> between Britain and the EU.</p>
<p>Speaking on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the destiny of the UK now lies firmly in its people's hands.</p>
<p>He said his government would take on the duty "with a sense of purpose and with the interests of the British public at the heart of everything" it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson spoke of wanting a new relationship with the EU as its biggest ally, after <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/1230/1186933-brexit/" target="_blank">MPs approved the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement yesterday with an overwhelming majority in a House of Commons vote</a>.</p>
<p>17.4 million voters, or 52%&nbsp;opted to leave the EU in a referendum on 23 June 2016.&nbsp;16.1 million, or 48%, voted to remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of that referendum has dominated British politics ever since and seen the departure of two Prime Ministers,&nbsp;David Cameron and Theresa May,&nbsp;as debate raged about whether another referendum should be called, and how the result of the 2016 vote should be implemented.</p>
<p>The referendum showed a United Kingdom divided about much more than the European Union, and has fuelled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and modern Britishness.</p>
<p>After the United Kingdom leaves the Single Market and&nbsp;the Customs Union tonight, there is almost certain to be some disruption at borders. More red tape means more cost for those importing and exporting goods across the EU-UK border.</p>
<p>The English Port of Dover expects volumes to drop off in early January. The most worrisome period, it says, will be in mid&nbsp;to late January when volumes pick up again.</p>
<p>Walking away from almost half a century of membership means change to everything from pet passports and driving licence rules for the British in Europe to data rules.</p><hr>

<hr>
<p>After clinching a Christmas Eve trade deal intended to smooth out the worst disruption, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted both William Shakespeare and TS&nbsp;Eliot.</p>
<p>"Parting is such sweet sorrow," she said. "What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning."</p>

<p><b>Deal reached to keep Gibraltar border open</b></p>
<p>Gibraltar's border with Spain will remain open following the end of the Brexit transition period,&nbsp;after the UK and European Union agreed a draft deal.</p>
<p>The Rock's status was not covered in the trade agreement reached by Boris Johnson on Christmas Eve, prompting concerns about what would happen when the transition period ends at 11pm tonight.</p>
<p>Gibraltar, whose sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain, will remain subject to the rule of the free-travel Schengen area, Spain's foreign minister said.</p>
<p>Arancha Gonzalez Laya announced that the "agreement in principle" means people in Gibraltar "can breathe a sigh of relief".</p>
<p>She said that further details on the agreement would be published in the New Year.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: "Today, working side by side with the chief minister of Gibraltar, and following intensive discussions with the Spanish government, we reached agreement on a political framework to form the basis of a separate treaty between the UK and the EU regarding Gibraltar.</p>
<p>"We will now send this to the European Commission, in order to initiate negotiations on the formal treaty.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, all sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the transition period on Gibraltar, and in particular ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides.</p>
<p>"We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar and its sovereignty. I am grateful to foreign minister Laya and her team for their positive and constructive approach.</p>
<p>"We have a warm and strong relationship with Spain, and we look forward to building on it in 2021."&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/0015eea2-614.jpg?ratio=1.78"></p>
<p><b>Minister updates Cabinet of impact on fishing</b></p>
<p>The Minister for Agriculture has&nbsp;said that&nbsp;while trade can continue tariff-free, he updated the cabinet on the potential impacts on the agri-food and fishing sectors earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The main impacts in relation to administrative costs in doing trade with Britain and also health certification and SPS checks which agri-food products have to undergo," Charlie McConalogue said.</p>
<p>"There is differing assessments in what that might mean," he added.</p>
<p>Speaking on RTÉ's Today with Philip Boucher Hayes, he said there has been significant support assured already in advance of Brexit for the agri-food sector in terms of grant aid and financial support.</p>
<p>He also said post-Brexit he will be going to Brussels to fight the Irish case as strongly as possible for the fisheries sector.</p>
<p>"The Brexit adjustment reserve, we will be looking for our significant share of that in terms of the compensation.</p>
<p>"Also, in terms of working with my European colleagues to ensure we have a strong allocation of quota as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Revenue has confirmed that its specialised Customs Service is already operating in advance of the Brexit transition period ending tonight</p>
<p>From 11pm a valid Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN) is required for all goods carried by commercial vehicles to and from Britain by ferry.</p>
<p>Revenue says its Customs Roll on-Roll off (RoRo) Service is up and running and a transport company, haulier, importer, exporter or customs agent can create a PBN for any ferry due to sail after 11pm.</p>
<p>The Customs RoRo Service was designed to help efficiently move goods and vehicles between Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
<p>The service also allows truck drivers to check, prior to disembarking a ferry in Ireland, if a vehicle can exit the port or if it is required to call to Customs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>This tutorial opens the series of articles about "Project JiJi" and describes how to add autofocus to the 16 mm Telephoto Lens mounted on the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera. In the past months, I've been working on a project to add autofocus to the lens and this is the result:</p><div><p><iframe width="100%" height="315" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrbyPmq_Z7Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>Adding some background to this: The Raspberry Pi Foundation offers different Raspberry Pi Camera modules since 2013. The first module (5-megapixel) was produced in 2013, and an 8-megapixel module upgrade (v2) was released in 2016. Both models have visible light and infrared versions. This year (2020), the Foundation launched the HQ Camera. This is a 12-megapixel High Quality (thus HQ) camera (Sony IMX477), which adds the possibility to use a lens with CS-mount. It is a great upgrade, but the lens and the camera lack autofocus up to now.</p><p>If you are impatient, you can find the hardware design, firmware and software on the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/rPIFocus">lemariva/rPIFocus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus">lemariva/uPyFocus</a> repositories. But, you should come back and read the tutorial until the end, so that you can understand how it works, and if you want to, you can also cooperate on this project!</p><h2><span id="software-and-hardware-322504">Software and Hardware</span></h2><p>This section includes the software and hardware needed for this tutorial.</p><h2><span id="diy-project-jiji-322504">DIY: Project JiJi</span></h2><p>In this article, I will explain how to build the project yourself. I won't go deeper in detail. These will be covered in future articles.</p><h2><span id="hardware-pcb-ordering-soldering-and-mounting-322504">Hardware: PCB ordering, soldering, and mounting</span></h2><p>As you may have already noticed, to add autofocus to the camera, you will need to order a PCB and solder and mount some parts. In the Github repository, under the folder <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/rPIFocus/tree/main/pcb">`pcb</a>`, you'll find the schematic as well as the board files for the PCB. To open those files, you'll need <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.autodesk.de/products/eagle/overview">Eagle</a>. Eagle is still free for hobbyists, thus, download and install it to open the files. You can export Gerber files using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/137-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-autodesk-eagle">this export-to-gerber tutorial</a>.</p><p>To simplify the process for you, I also added the Gerber files that you can directly send to your PCB provider. I use and recommend <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jlcpcb.com/">jlcpcb</a>. They are fast, cheap, reliable and the quality of the boards is pretty good. Check out the setting and costs for this project in Fig. 1.

They are controlled by the M5Stack ATOM, which also measures the steppers' currents and offers an RestAPI to send the commands (see Fig. 2 for an basic PCB schematic).</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg" alt="Simple PCB schematic" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg 899w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg 899w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__768.jpg 768w"><br><span>Fig. 2: Simple PCB schematic.</span></p></div><p>Fig. 3 to Fig. 8 show you some close photos of the design to help you to mount the elements. Fig. 3 shows you how to mount the aperture and focus belt rings. They usually have a standard of 0.8 mm pitch. So the motor pinions should be compatible with that. Fig. 4 shows the mounted motor. Check the cable color - or the order! They are connected to the A4988 drivers (Fig. 5) and that's the right connection. Otherwise, the driver won't be able to switch the electromagnets in the right sequence and the motor won't rotate. I planned a cut on the PCB so that the pinion distance to the belt ring can be modified and the motor can be fixed as shown in Fig. 6 (using a 2.5 mm screw) - not the best way, but it works ;). To fix the camera to the board, I used a 3/8 inch screw and an adapter to mount that to a tripod (see Fig. 7). The screw fixes the camera to the board. The camera tends to rotate, and it releases the screw. If that's the case, you can fix it using the two 3mm holes on the left of the camera base (see Fig. 8) with an e.g. rectangular piece of wood over the board. Finally, you need to mount the INA219 and two pinheads for the M5Stack ATOM Matrix. The INA219 measures the current of the steppers, which are used to identify the rotational limits of the focus and aperture rings. Therefore, after booting, the system calibrates itself and it doesn't require encoders to measure the steppers positions.</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg" alt="Focus and aperture ring belts" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 3: Focus and aperture ring belts.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg" alt="Motor connection and gear mouting" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 4: Motor connection and gear mouting.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg" alt="A4988 Motor stepper driver" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 5: A4988 Motor stepper driver.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg" alt="Motor fixing" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 6: Motor fixing.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg" alt="Camera fixing / tripod adapter" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 7: Camera fixing / tripod adapter.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg" alt="INA219 and M5Stack ATOM matrix" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 8: Camera rotate fix option.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg" alt="INA219 and M5Stack ATOM matrix" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 9: INA219 and M5Stack ATOM matrix.</span></p></div><p>As you can see in Fig. 9, there are some ICs, capacitors, and resistors that aren't assembled and also two cables (red and black). The cables supply 7.5V for the motors. The ICs, capacitors, and resistors are planned to provide 5V and 3.3V to the M5Stack, A4988 drivers, and the INA219. Currently (in that Fig. 9), they are supplied via the USB cable connected, on one end, to the M5Stack, on the other, to the Raspberry Pi. So, you have two ways to supply the system :). But, yes, you need two power suppliers: one for the steppers (7.5V) and one for the Raspberry Pi (5V). The 5V on the board (via ICs) won't be able to supply the Raspberry Pi. Sorry, but I didn't want to use bigger ICs for that.</p><h2><span id="m5stack-application-322504">M5Stack Application</span></h2><p>As I described before, the M5Stack ATOM Matrix controls the motors and offers a RestAPI to receive the commands. The M5Stack application is programmed in MicroPython. If you haven't heard about MicroPython, you can check this tutorial: <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2020/03/tutorial-getting-started-micropython-v20">Getting Started with MicroPython on ESP32, M5Stack, and ESP8266</a>. MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimized to run on microcontrollers and in "constrained environments".
The application is located <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus">lemariva/uPyFocus</a>.</p><p>So, follow these steps to upload the application to the M5Stack:</p><ol><li>Flash MicroPython to the M5Stack as described in <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2020/03/tutorial-getting-started-micropython-v20">this tutorial</a>.</li><li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus">lemariva/uPyFocus</a> repository:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus.git</code></pre></li><li>Open the folder <code>uPyFocus</code> with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and rename the <code>config.py.sample</code> to <code>config.py</code>.</li><li>Open the file and add your Wi-Fi credentials in this section:
<pre><code>wifi = {
    'ssid':'',
    'password':''
}</code></pre>
<p>The M5Stack needs to connect to your Wi-Fi so that the Raspberry Pi (also connected to your Wi-Fi/LAN) can find it and sends the commands to control the steppers.</p></li><li>Upload the application to the M5Stack.</li></ol><p>After uploading the code, the M5Stack resets and starts with the calibration routine (check video section: nnn). Take note of the IP that the M5Stack reports while connecting to your Wi-Fi. You'll need that to configure the Microservices Application.</p><h2><span id="docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-322504">Docker and docker-compose on Raspberry Pi</span></h2><p>The application that runs on the Raspberry Pi is a microservices application. That means different services are orchestrated to offer an application. The orchestration is performed by docker-compose and the services are containerized using Docker.</p><p>To install Docker on the Raspberry Pi, just type the following on a Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker pi</code></pre>
<p>If you want to learn more about Docker on Embedded System, just read this tutorial: <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2018/05/tutorial-docker-on-embedded-systems-raspberry-pi-beagleboard">Tutorial: Docker on Embedded Systems (Raspberry Pi &amp; Beagleboard)</a></p><p>To orchestrate the services, you need to install <code>docker-compose</code>. This can be done by typing:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip3 -v install docker-compose</code></pre>
<p>Usually, you need to install these dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
sudo apt-get remove python-configparser</code></pre>
<h2><span id="memory-disk-optional-322504">Memory Disk (optional)</span></h2><p>To take photos faster, you can create a disk on RAM. A RAM disk offers faster access to the data compared to an SD card or a connected USB disk. Thus, this allows the application to reduce the time between photos. To do that, you need to create a folder by typing on a Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /mnt/ramdisk</code></pre>
<p>Then, you need to modify the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file and add a line at the end of the file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/fstab
### add the following line at the file's end:
tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=50M 0 0</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can mount it using:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mount -a</code></pre>
<p>To ensure that everything is working, just reboot your Raspberry Pi using:</p>
<pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>
<p>To display the newly created drive and check it use the following command.</p>
<pre><code>df -h</code></pre>
<h2><span id="microservices-application-322504">Microservices Application</span></h2><p>The services of the microservices application are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>webapp</strong>: it provides the frontend application (webserver). It is programmed in Angular.</li><li><strong>backend</strong>: it communicates with the frontend via a RestAPI (Flask server), controls the camera, sends the signals to the M5Stack to control the motors, sends the signals and data to the other services to identify objects and take photos. Basically, it is the core service. It is programmed in Python.</li><li><strong>obj-detector</strong>: it receives an image over UDP and identifies the object on it and returns a JSON message. It is programmed in Python. It uses TensorFlow and connects to the Coral USB Accelerator to process the data in real-time.</li><li><strong>photo-service</strong>: it receives a signal via RestAPI (Flask server) to take photos and it processes them to create HDR photos. It is programmed in Python and it uses Celery for multitasking/non-blocking response to the RestAPI.</li><li><strong>redis</strong>: Celery uses this service to schedule the tasks.</li></ul><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg" alt="Webservice Microservices Application" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__768.jpg 768w"><br><span>Fig. 10: Webservice Microservices Application.</span></p></div><p>To start the Microservices application, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Download the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file or just clone the complete <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/rPIFocus">lemariva/rPIFocus</a> repository:

<p>I’ve been trying something new over the past couple of years. That is, I’ve been posting threads and such on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fogus">my Twitter</a> with a small handful of posts here  That said, there were a few high-traffic posts on my blog.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Favorite technical books discovered (and read)</h2>

<p>I’ve intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I consume, but there are a few that I “found” in 2020 that stood out.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-History-Memoir-Brian-Kernighan/dp/1695978552?tag=fogus-20">UNIX: A History and a Memoir</a></em> by Brian Kernigan – <em>this was much better than i thought it would be. regardless of how you view UNIX the anecdotes and stories are worth reading.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-VLSI-Systems-Carver-Mead/dp/0201043580?tag=fogus-20">Introduction to Very Large Scale Integration Systems</a></em> by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway – <em>this book might have motivated the spread of Alan Kay’s famous quote in across the general computer landscape — ‘People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware’ — but it didn’t. certainly Conway and Mead’s seminal work is deeply influential but even still most industry folks don’t understand VLSI except superficially, myself included.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dataflow-Programming-Language-Studies-Processing/dp/0127296506/?tag=fogus-20">Lucid, the Dataflow Programming Language</a></em> by William Wadge – <em>if enjoy twisting the langdev center of your brain into a pretzel then Lucid might be your thing. the book builds to the main language from subset languages, each teaching core principles. this is a new addition to my personal CS book pantheon.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Footsteps-Empty-Valley-issue-3-ebook/dp/B06X6JGM5L/?tag=fogus-20">Footsteps In An Empty Valley issue 3</a></em> by Chen-Hanson Ting – <em>a book that tries to make a parallel between Zen and Forth. i can’t say if the two did meet but it was an entertaining journey nonetheless.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Apple-DOS-Don-Worth/dp/0912985003/?tag=fogus-20">Beneath Apple DOS</a></em> by Don Worth – <em>while trying to squeeze out as much performance from his Apple ][ to run his game Beneath Apple Manor, Don Worth explore the darkest recesses of his computer to find every speed hack that he could use. his findings were published in this book.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite non-technical books read</h2>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Media-Extensions-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0262631598/?tag=fogus-20">Understanding Media</a></em> by Marshall McLuhan – <em>this book has been… a challenge… to read so far, but so far I’ve found the effort worthwhile. McLuhan died in 1980, but seems to have been talking about us.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confederacy-Dunces-John-Kennedy-Toole/dp/0802130208/?tag=fogus-20">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em> by John Kennedy Toole – <em>i had this book all wrong. you see, before 2020 i viewed it from a position of pure ignorance, tainted by prejudices. you see, in the past some of the worst people that i have known loved this book so naturally i made an association with it. couple these biases with the fact that a gloss of the story — three intermingled storylines populated by utterly broken people with the most broken of all taking center stage — seemed not worth my time. all of this said, i eventually broke down and decided to try the first chapter. well, the first motivated the second and it in turn motivated the third and so on until finally i was done. and wow was it a great book. it’s the kind of book that absolutely deserves its accolades and despite finding its place on the pedestals of the the Ignatius Reillys of the world, is a must read by lovers of literature.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hitler-Ascent-1889-1939-Volker-Ullrich/dp/1101872055/?tag=fogus-20">Hitler: Ascent, 1889-1939</a></em> by Volker Ullrich – <em>i’ve read my share of books on the subject but what i found especially compelling about this take was its focus on most of the points along the ascent where the powers of the time could have tamped out the eventual greatest evil but refused.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Classical-Education-Stuff-Taught-School/dp/1782430105/?tag=fogus-20">A Classical Education: The Stuff You Wish You’d Been Taught at School</a></em> by Caroline Taggart – <em>i was [this] close to attending St. Johns College where a classical education is compulsory but since i didn’t i’ve often wondered what i missed out on. while this book is no substitution for a classical education, it does provide a nice outline for diving deeper should one be compelled to do so.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wise-Blood-Novel-FSG-Classics/dp/0374530637/?tag=fogus-20">Wise Blood</a></em> by Flannery O’Connor – <em>like ACoDunces mentioned above, my prejudices prevented me from reading Wise Blood for far longer than I should have. however, in the case of the O’Connor classic it was the negative view by people whom i admire that kept me away. again an opportunity to buck my prejudices presented itself and as a result a pantheonic book<sup id="fnref:pant"><a href="#fn:pant" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> was found. the book masquerades as a morality tale but lurking beneath is a nihilistic romp that’s kept me thinking for weeks after reading it. it’s stuck with me and i can’t foresee it leaving my mind any time soon.</em></li>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-meant-burning-Vlor/dp/B000QQPR1A/?tag=fogus-20">Vlor</a></em> – <em>a nice layering of haunting guitar and persistent drones. it’s always nice to discover new “headspace music.”</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://soundcloud.com/shakulatte">Shakulatte</a></em> – <em>a blend of traditional Japanese skakuhachi music with some blues and jazz for good measure. full disclosure: Adam is a very good friend of mine but i’ve always loved his music and would listen even if i didn’t know him.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://zacbentz.bandcamp.com/album/field-recordings-from-the-edge-of-hell">Dirty Knobs</a></em> – <em>specifically the “Field Recordings From The Edge Of Hell” album which is atmospheric and brooding.</em></li>

<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-North-East/dp/B07MF1M626/?tag=fogus-20">British Railway Journeys</a></em> with Robert Symes</p>

<h2>Favorite films/shows discovered</h2>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lighthouse-Willem-Dafoe/dp/B07Z4236MR/?tag=fogus-20">The Lighthouse</a></em> – <em>a fantastic freaking film. it’s horror in that it’s somewhat tangential to a Lovecraftian experience all the while skirting the line between myth and time. on the surface the film tells a tale of loneliness, frustration, alcoholism, and the slow slide into madness but there’s a lot more going on than meets the eye.</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Episode-1/dp/B00S1VFB36/?tag=fogus-20">Fortitude</a></em> – <em>quite grim in terms of exposing the dark side of the human condition but I was in the mood for that. you have to be. It has some truly memorable characters.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite games discovered</h2>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://all-aboardgames.com/products/us-only-18chesapeake-preorder">18Chesapeake</a></em> – <em>for fans of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX">18XX games</a> this is train-game comfort food. however, the reason that it makes the …</em></li></ul></div></div></div>

<h2> Endorsements</h2>

<ul>

  <li> "My favorite machine learning book just received a face-lift!
    'Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction' is the most
    comprehensive and accessible book on modern machine learning by a
    large margin.  
    It now also covers the latest developments in deep learning and
    causal discovery. With this upgrade it will remain the reference
    book for our field that every respected researcher needs to have
    on their desk."  -- <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/">Max Welling</a>,
    U. Amsterdam 

    </li><li> "There are many books on machine learning out there, but none gives
    such a well-rounded, up-to-date, and comprehensive view of the
    field as this one. We use this book as reference reading for our
    students taking the advanced machine learning course at Oxford to
    introduce them to fundamental as well as current topics in the
    field. I'm amazed at the amount of work that went into this
    book---which will surely be used by many to train the next
      generation of machine learning experts."

Why grow a cyanobacteria in space you might say? Well what these little guys can do is convert carbon dioxide into oxygen gas for one, and secondly they can also be ingested as a protein substitute. It contains<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)#Food_and_nutrition"> 50-70% protein </a>by dry weight for starters, high in iron, and is nearly 300 cals / 100 g to boot. So in terms of a great symbiotic friend for a closed biome (i.e. a sealed steel ball in orbit), Spirulina is a pretty darn perfect room mate.</p><p>Okay I was hooked after a few videos from Youtube and Reddit. How do I get a sample of this West African extremophile? Turns out Amazon, among a myraid of products, also carries this...</p><p>So I ordered this from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.algaelab.org/">AlgaeLab</a> back when they had a Amazon store, it appears they don't have it anymore (July 2017). But they still do ship from their website. So take this in, I purchased a biological sample, shipping from California to Toronto, and it arrived in a little over a week with a bunch of Alkali salts without any major delay at customs. Are you kidding me? A biological sample and miscellaneous white powder can pass through the borders that easy, but I have had books delayed?!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1501375207629_153452"><div>

First into a water percolator to catch dust, then into the glass bottles. One tube was connected to an airstone which creates small air bubbles which will allow greater oxygen dissolution into the medium, and the second tube causes stirring from the bottom to the top of the water column by means of entraining liquid in a bubble tea straw similar to an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift_pump">airlift pump</a> or geyser pump. The effect of the air pump is then two fold, greater carbon dioxide diffusion and stirring of the algae.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_2_1501381010248_27504"><div>

Ever wonder why its called Spirlina? The cyanobacteria form a spiral-like shape when they get too much sunlight. Since sunlight is always going to come from one direction at a time (applied to one face), by rearranging into a spiral, only a fraction of total surface area is exposed. And what if the amount of light is too low and not ideal? They straighten out into a line to increase available surface area! How neat is that?</p><p>I bought a cheap $60 chinese microscope on Amazon (most of my projects start at amazon tbh) capable of 800x magnification and I took a cell phone picture through the cheap crappy plastic lenses. As you can see, spirals! Look at that!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_2_1501381010248_38600"><div>

                <p>Message Queues are now fairly prevalent—there are so many of them showing up so fast you'd think they were <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">rabbits</a> with an unlimited supply of <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/">celery</a>, resulting in an <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">kafkaesque</a> situation where making a decision is like trying to catch a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro">stream</a> in your hands. If only there were fewer <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns">simple</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">services</a> that could help with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">publishing and subscribing</a>, it would be so much easier to make a <a href="https://zeromq.org/">zero-effort</a> choice 😕</p><p>Whether we use them by themselves as-is to move data between parts of our application, or as an integral part of the architecture (like event driven systems), message queues are here to stay. In a way, they've been here all along—just without as many names. But what are they? Why are they useful? And how do we use them effectively? Which implementation do we pick? Does it even matter which one we use? And do we need to learn each of them individually, or are there more general concepts that apply to all message queues?</p><p>In this guide, we'll talk about:</p><ul><li>What message queues are and their history.</li><li>Why they're useful and what mental models to use when reasoning about them.</li><li>Delivery guarantees that the queuing systems make (at-least-once, at-most-once, and exactly-once semantics).</li><li>Ordering and FIFO guarantees and how they effect sequencing, parallelism and performance.</li><li>Patterns for fan-out and fan-in: delivering one message to many systems or messages from many systems into one.</li><li>Notes on the pros and cons of many popular systems available today.</li></ul><h2 id="what-are-message-queues">What are message queues?</h2><p>Message Queues are a way to transfer information between two systems. This information—a message—can be data, metadata, signals, or a combination of all three. The systems that are sending and receiving messages could be processes on the same computer, modules of the same application, services that might but running on different computers or technology stacks, or entirely different kinds of systems altogether—like transferring information from your software into an email or an SMS on the cellphone network.</p><p>The idea of a messaging system has been around a very long time, from the message boxes used for moving information between people or office departments (literally where the words <em>inbox </em>and <em>outbox</em> come from), to telegrams, to your local postal or courier service. The messaging systems in the physical world that come closest to what we have in computing are probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube">pnuematic</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pneumatic+tubes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1366">tubes</a> that moved messages through buildings and cities using compressed air until a few decades ago (and are still used in some places today).</p><p>The kinds of messages we transfer today might be a note that something technical happened, like CPU usage exceeding a limit; or a business event of interest, like a customer placing an order; or a signal, like a command that tells another service to do something. The contents of each message will be driven entirely by the architecture of your application and its purposes—so for the rest of this guide, we don't need to be concerned about what's inside a message—we're more concerned with how the message gets from the system where it originates (the <em>producer</em>, <em>source, publisher</em> or <em>sender</em>) to the system where's it's supposed to go (the <em>consumer</em>, <em>subscriber</em>, <em>destination</em> or <em>receiver</em>).</p><h2 id="and-why-do-we-need-them">And Why Do We Need Them?</h2><p>We need message queues because no system exists or works in isolation—all systems need to communicate with other systems in structured ways that they both can understand, and at a controlled speed that they both can handle. Any non-trivial process needs a way to move information between each stage of the process; any workflow needs a way to move the intermediate product between the stages of that workflow. Message queues are a great way to handle this movement. There are plenty of ways of getting these messages around using API calls, file systems, or many other abuses of the natural order of things; but all of these are ad-hoc implementations of the message queue that we sometimes refuse to acknowledge we need.</p><p>The simplest mental model for a message queue is a very long tube that you can roll a ball into. You write your message on a ball, roll it into the tube, and someone or something else receives it at the other end. There are a lot of interesting benefits with this model, some of which are:</p><ul><li>We don't need to worry about <em>who or what</em> is going to receive the message – that's one less responsibility for the sender to be concerned about.</li><li>We don't need to worry about <em>when</em> the receiver is going to pick up the message.</li><li>We can put <em>as many</em> messages as we want into the tube (let's assume we have a infinitely long tube) at whatever <em>speed</em> is comfortable to us.</li><li>The receiver will <em>never be impacted</em> by our actions—they will pull out as many messages as they want at whatever rate is comfortable to them.</li><li>Neither the sender nor the receiver are concerned with <em>how</em> the other works.</li><li>Neither the sender nor the receiver are concerned with the <em>capacity or load</em> of the other.</li><li>Neither system is concerned with <em>where</em> the other one is – they may or many not reside on the same computer, network, continent or even the same planet.</li></ul><p>Each of these advantages (and this isn't even an exhaustive list) has very important benefits in software development—what they all have in common is <em>decoupling</em>. One system is decoupled from the other in terms of responsibility, time, bandwidth, internal workings, load and geography. And decoupling is a very desirable part of any distributed or complex system—the more decoupled the parts of the system are, the easier it is to independently build, test, run, maintain and scale them.</p><p>Most systems interact with other outside or third-party systems as well—if we build a shopping site we might interact with a payment processor, and let’s say we attempt to directly communicate with the payment processor on each user click. If our system is under heavy load, we're also subjecting the other system to the same load. And vice versa—if our payment provider needs to send us millions of pieces of information about our past payment statues, our system better be ready. The two systems are now <em>coupled</em>. The decisions and actions made by one system have a significant impact on the other, so the needs of both need to be taken into account while making every decision. Add enough other systems into the mix, like logistics or delivery systems, and we quickly have a paralysing mess that makes it difficult to decide anything at all. If one system goes down, the other systems have effectively gone down as well, for no fault of their own.</p><p>We’re also in trouble if we want to switch out any one of these systems for another one, like a new payment processor or delivery system. We’d have to make deep changes in multiple places in our application, and it’s even more difficult to build code to split our messages between multiple providers—we may want to use a ratio to load balance them or split them by geography; or dynamically switch between them based on each provider’s availability or cost.</p><p>Message queues offer the decoupling that solves a lot of these problems. If we set up a queue between two systems that need to communicate with each other, they can now go about their work without having to worry about each other at all—we put our messages aimed at any system into a queue, and we expect information from the other system to come to us through another queue as well. We now have clear points at which we can add rules or make the changes we require, without either system knowing or caring about what's different.</p><h3 id="so-what-s-the-catch">So what's the catch?</h3><p>Are message queues the holy grail of computing, though? Do they solve all the world's problems? No, of course not. There are plenty of situations where we might not want to use them. And we certainly don't want to use a queue just because we have one easily available and think it might be fun. There are some systems that are really simple that just don't require it—a message queue is a way to reduce to complexity of communicating systems, but two communicating systems will always be more complex than one system that doesn't have to communicate. If you have a system that’s simple enough to not require communication with any others, there simply isn't any reason to reach for a queue.</p><p>There are also systems that communicate with each other, but where the complexity added by that communication added is insignificant and not worth worrying about. Or more often the systems are already coupled, in the sense that they all need to work together to function. A really common example is an application server and a data service (in an <em>OLTP</em> system). There's not much point in decoupling them with a queue, because neither can do anything useful without the direct involvement of the other.</p><p>Then there's performance to consider as well—the whole point of decoupling two systems with regards to time and load is so that they can each process information at their own pace—but we certainly would <em>not</em> want this to happen in performance sensitive applications or real-time systems. A queue might help us process more work at the same time (the receiver might have many processes working in parallel on the messages you send) but will remove any guarantees we need about the exact time taken for each piece of work. If predictability is more important than throughput, we're better off without a queue.</p><p>Using a queue might increase the time taken to process each <em>individual</em> message, but will allow you process many more messages at the same time across different computers—so your total number of messages processed per minute or hour, or <em>throughput</em>, will increase.</p><p>If we do have multiple systems that need to communicate, and that communication needs to be <em>durable </em>(if we’ve put a message into a queue, we want to be sure that the messaging system isn’t going to ‘forget’ about it) and decoupled, a message queue is indispensable.</p><h2 id="arguing-semantics">Arguing Semantics</h2><p>There's simply no way to learn about message queues without reading and/or arguing about delivery guarantees …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">
        <p>I’ve enjoyed playing a game called Avalon recently. I won’t go too far into the rules, but it’s a <a href="https://www.bestplay.co/ultimate-guide-hidden-role-board-games/">hidden role game</a> in the vein of Secret Hitler or Werewolf, where one team is “good”, trying to uncover who among them is “evil”, before the evil team wins.</p>

<p>One of the characters you can play is Merlin. Merlin knows who the evil players are, but can’t reveal what he knows, because the evil team can kill Merlin and win the game. So Merlin relies on another character, Percival, to be his decoy.</p>

<p>Percival’s only power is that he knows who Merlin is. So he secretly watches Merlin’s actions throughout the game and amplifies those signals to the rest of the group. The typical strategy is for Percival to attract attention away from Merlin and towards himself.</p>

<p>But another, riskier strategy is for <em>Merlin</em> to play as though <em>he</em> is Percival. In this case, Merlin displays what he knows so shamelessly that he throws everyone off. The evil team, believing that no Merlin would be stupid enough to put himself out there like that, figures he must be Percival, and writes him off.</p>

<p>The Merlin-as-Percival strategy is bold, because it blatantly defies our expectations about how the game is won. To pull it off, Merlin must create confusion around his actions. He needs the other players to feel unsure about whether he’s being incredibly stupid or incredibly smart.</p>

<p>Increasingly, I think the “shameless” approach is becoming a dominant strategy today. It was first popularized in modern canon by Paris Hilton, who played the “dumb blonde heiress” stereotype so smoothly that everyone assumed she really was as stupid as she seemed.</p>

<p>Paris didn’t play by the “obvious” rules for famous people. She was widely derided by both media and her peers as at best, a train wreck, and at worst, a self-serving aggrandizer. And yet, people couldn’t stop talking about her. A decade later, Paris is now remembered as the mastermind behind the playbook that’s made the Kardashians, Jenners, and other celebrity socialites so successful.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that people were dismissive of Paris because validating her playbook would mean admitting that <em>they</em> were playing an inferior game. Everyone else had invested years into optimizing for the most legible version of the rules. They’d look silly if they were to admit she had found a better way of doing things.</p>

<p>Without getting into tiresome politics, the “shameless” strategy also defined the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. It was shouted down by people in both established political parties, because they were used to playing by the “obvious” rules, but I suspect that in a decade’s time, we’ll look back on that election and realize that it marked the beginning of an entirely new style of politics.</p>

<p>Ditto to, perhaps, the leadership styles of Mark Zuckerberg, who’s followed the “obvious” playbook for years, versus Jack Dorsey, who employs tactics that seem so obviously stupid (tweeting about fasting and meditation!) that we’re quick to write them off. And yet, I’d guess that Zuckerberg’s strategy makes him increasingly unlikeable and untrustworthy, in the same way that any major politician sticking to a pre-2016 playbook today is almost certainly not going to win.</p>

<p>The shameless strategy feels counterintuitive, because our first instinct is to want to punish that sort of behavior. And historically, those sanctions have been effective. Punishing outlandish behavior is an important aspect of cooperative governance: it preserves social order by ensuring that we all play by the same rules.</p>

<p>Today, it seems like punishing shamelessness only <em>increases</em> social rewards to the transgressor. What’s changed?</p>

<p>One explanation might be that it’s an expected effect of the blurring of social boundaries today. In the past, if the size of your community was finitely bounded (like a village, or an aristocratic social class), people didn’t enter or exit these communities as frequently. Under these conditions, sanctions are probably still effective, because members of the community want to be liked and accepted.</p>

<p>But the borders to online communities are much more fluid - perhaps even nonexistent. Under open borders, sanctions will backfire, because they just serve as a signaling boost for the transgressor, attracting outsiders who resonate with that person’s message. What’s meant to be punishment instead becomes a flare shot straight into the night sky.</p>

<p>The “establishment” mistakenly assumes that a shameless person wants the approval of their community, when it turns out that, much like any cult or counterculture, that person’s goal was to attract a following, regardless of who the members are. The disgust of one’s peers doesn’t matter anymore, because that disgust forms the basis for an entirely new community.</p>

<p>A common critique of shameless people is questioning their intelligence. But one of the most bizarre aspects here is it doesn’t actually matter how aware that person is of what they’re doing. The concept of a “genius mastermind” is itself outdated, because it assumes that someone needs to be in control. The shameless person is simply a host for a set of ideas, which, like any virus, will continue to propagate as long as there are willing hosts to receive it.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure what the long-term implications of shamelessness will be. I also don’t think that everybody has to employ this strategy to win (at least, I hope not!). But what I do know is when I see my peers rolling their eyes at someone or deriding them for being “shameless”, there’s a good chance that, instead of writing them off, we should examine their actions a bit more closely.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

      how to harden Linux as much as possible for security and privacy. This guide attempts to be distribution-agnostic and is not tied to any specific one. </p><p>

    </p></div>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.
    </p></div>

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>
