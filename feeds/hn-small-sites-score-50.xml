	<h4>A programmer named <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Johnson</a> recently discovered that enabling the “Clear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome” meant Google Search and YouTube cookies were not deleted, and exempt from this rule.</h4>
<p>He found that the only way to include Google and YouTube cookies for clearing is to specifically add <code>google.com</code> and <code>youtube.com</code> to <em>sites that can never use cookies</em> – it is not made obvious to the user that Google’s own services are exempt from the cookie clearing rule by default. <em>(<a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/chrome-google.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-privacy-chrome-youtube-search-bug-b1180705.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Independent</em></a> investigated this issue and found similar results.</p>
<p>Google was made aware of this issue, and a Google spokesperson issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are aware of a bug in Chrome that is impacting how cookies are cleared on some first-party Google websites. We are investigating the issue, and plan to roll out a fix in the coming days.” (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/19/google_cookie_wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>)<em><br>

<p><em><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> Google has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long history of privacy violations</a>, which is one of the primary reasons I recommend finding ways to become less reliant on their services. A good first step would be to replace Chrome with <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a>, and from there, looking to replace Google Search with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://startpage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Startpage</a>.</em></p>

<p>This post is in response to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Apple’s App Store Small Business Program announcement</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For decades, developers were able to create and distribute their software, whether free or for a fee, to anyone with a PC or laptop. There was no gatekeeper deciding who was in or out, and there was no requirement that they hand over a significant percentage of their revenue to the device maker.</p>
<p>Video game consoles were the obvious exception to this, with the claim that they were specialized devices and, therefore, closed ecosystems. But personal computing was open, and that was an important catalyst for innovation for a long time.</p>
<p>That changed with the introduction of Apple's app store on iOS. Developers had to be approved by Apple, and had to agree to use Apple as their sole payment processor, to the tune of $99/year and 30% of their revenue. For contrast, payment processors at the time were charging around 2.9% and $0.30/transaction. That's a massive difference in and of itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 30% number was based on what video game consoles were charging developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="apples-original-rationale">Apple's original rationale</h2>
<p>Apple's argument for the iPhone being a closed ecosystem was that a phone is a specialized device because its primary function is to make phone calls, and that primary function must be protected against rogue software that may disrupt its ability to make those calls.</p>
<p>Apple's argument that the 30% fee was fair was that it takes manpower to review and approve apps to be listed on their store.</p>
<h2 id="ripples-into-other-app-stores">Ripples into other app stores</h2>
<p>The issue grew bigger as Google implemented similar requirements and fee structures on the Android app store, and pretty much every app store from Steam to Samsung Galaxy followed suit.</p>
<p>Now that Microsoft and Apple have introduced app stores on Windows and macOS, they plan to slowly erode our freedom on PCs too so that they can reap the same financial benefits on our labour on all computing platforms (save for open source operating systems like Linux). Apple has since added warning messages discouraging users not to install third party software that hasn't paid for Apple's signature of approval. These warnings are getting more and more alarming with each OS upgrade, causing users to fear installing third party software through other, traditional means.</p>
<p>This needs to be stopped now because device makers are making the case that future devices like VR and AR headsets are also specialized devices and so they too should be subject to the same closed ecosystem and payment processing restrictions, which is simply untrue.</p>
<p>If an AR device replaces your PC, it's a generalized computing device, plain and simple.</p>
<h2 id="phones-are-not-specialized-computing-devices">Phones are not specialized computing devices</h2>
<p>Making phone calls was the sole function of a telephone, but a mobile phone is a powerful computer that can perform a wide range of functions. The new iPhone 12 Pro has built-in Lidar, a total of 4 cameras, GPS, and many other features that extend far being making phone calls.</p>
<p>What was once a primary feature is now just one of thousands, and potentially one of its least important features as we have dozens or more options for voice, video, and text-based messaging available to us. Many young people would probably be just fine on an iPod Touch that doesn't make calls at all, and many probably wouldn't know the difference.</p>
<p>Phones are general computing devices, and as such, should not be maintained as closed ecosystems. This doesn't benefit users, many of whom are also developers themselves, because it limits our freedom on both sides of the equation. General computing platforms should be protected from such predatory practices by manufacturers through strong government regulations.</p>
<h2 id="the-fee-isnt-the-issue-the-requirement-to-pay-is">The fee isn't the issue, the requirement to pay is</h2>
<p>Tying your right distribute an app that you developed independently of the hardware maker to the requirement to use their payment processor is anti-competitive because it means that every developer benefits the hardware maker while the hardware maker provides little more than a gatekeeper function and a small amount of file storage for their release builds.</p>
<p>How can any indie developer hope to compete with the likes of Apple or Google or Microsoft when every sale they make gives 15% of their profits over to their competition? And if they make more than $1m, it goes back up to 30%. That's a huge disparity that serves to protect the interests of the hardware maker at the expense of businesses everywhere.</p>
<p>If there was a hard cost for Apple and others to review and approve apps, then that should be charged up-front and not as a percentage of profit. Developers should be free to choose the payment processing service that best serves their needs, whether that's Stripe or Paypal or Apple's built-in offering. Apple's payment processor should be chosen because it's better, not because you have no other choice.</p>
<h2 id="disproportionate-profits">Disproportionate profits</h2>
<p>Since the cost of the review process and hosting are the justification for the payment processing fees, a good way to tell if they're in line with each other is to look at Apple's profits on the app store. In 2019, Apple generated about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$50bn in sales on the iOS app store</a>, with their take being about <strong>$15bn in profit</strong>.</p>
<p>Does it really cost Apple anywhere close to $15bn/year to maintain the app store's review process and hosting infrastructure?</p>
<h2 id="this-makes-some-business-models-unfeasible">This makes some business models unfeasible</h2>
<p>Some business models, like establishing a marketplace for content creators to share their work with each other, become unfeasible when 15-30% off the top goes straight to the device maker. Many businesses operate with profit margins well under 30% or even 15%. Amazon is widely known for maintaining a 1% profit margin across their entire business as a strategic advantage to be able to undercut everyone else.</p>
<p>Other payment processors are essentially locked out of these ecosystems entirely, which is unfair and anti-competitive against them. I bet Stripe would love to be able to provide a better mobile payment option – their core business – without Apple being such a significant portion of the sale, thereby negating any benefit that Stripe on its own can differentiate itself with.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-just-a-problem-for-developers">This is not just a "problem for developers"</h2>
<p>I've seen many comments on sites like Hacker News and MacRumours that this isn't a problem users should care about and that developers should essentially stop whining or take their software elsewhere. But this also limits the choices users have, and it limits the types of apps they get to benefit from. This limitation won't be felt directly, because you don't feel the absence of something you never knew you could have. <em>You don't know what you don't know.</em></p>
<p>Stifling innovation isn't good for anyone, and as more and more people become software developers, this really just hurts the small guys. The indies who are more similar in size and need to average consumers than the likes of tech giants like Apple or Google. Indie developers need protection from monopolistic and anti-competitive practices from larger players in the market through strong government regulation, not a discount on their first $1m in sales.</p>
<h2 id="this-model-is-being-replicated-in-vr-and-ar">This model is being replicated in VR and AR</h2>
<p>It's no secret that I work in Virtual Reality. In fact, writing this gives me some anxiety because my company could be targeted and harmed for me saying things that don't benefit the VR headset makers. <em>But this needs to be said.</em> In fact, I'd say this is one of the most important fights in the software industry today because it will determine whether future platforms are open or closed.</p>
<p>VR headsets have already been set up to be <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/walled-garden" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">walled gardens</a>, and although Oculus has turned a blind eye for the time being to third party app stores like <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SideQuest</a>, they could still decide to cut it off at any point in the future with little or no recourse.</p>
<p>Whether third party app stores are the solution also remains to be seen, but gauging by how difficult device makers make it for average users to install them, and what little percentage market share they have on each respective platform, I'd say they don't go far enough to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The ability to easily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sideload</a>, aka install software directly onto a device that you own and not through any given app store, is paramount to maintaining free access to today's as well as tomorrow's computing platforms. And we should have the ability to do so without navigating a maze of warnings discouraging the average user from doing so.</p>
<h2 id="pcs-will-become-headsets-which-are-general-computing-devices">PCs will become headsets, which are general computing devices</h2>
<p>Augmented Reality is still in its infancy and isn't a general computing platform yet, not because it's specialized but because the technology isn't of sufficient quality yet. But it's improving rapidly, and one day it will be good enough to overtake both PCs and phones as the dominant computing platform of the future.</p>
<p>When it does, it will be critical to indie developers everywhere that we maintain the same level of freedom on these future platforms that we enjoy today on PCs, and stop the current erosion of those freedoms by big tech companies. Failure to do so will close off all software that isn't blessed by device makers, which will further increase the financial divide between indie developers and the companies who will control the platforms of the future, whether that's Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Facebook. <em>We can't let that happen.</em></p>
<h2 id="whats-the-solution">What's the solution?</h2>
<p>The solution is simple and threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mobile phones and headset-based computing devices should be classified as general computing platforms in the eyes of the law.</li>
<li>General computing platforms should have the legal requirement that developers can distribute their software however they see fit, so long as it doesn't harm users (malware, spyware, etc.).</li>
<li>Choice of payment processors should not be forced on developers in exchange for the ability to distribute software on any general computing platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only when the above rights have been won in the eyes of the law will our fight be over on this front, but there will always be other …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

Here is the full text of an open letter which over 200 Facebook content moderators from across the world have just addressed to Facebook’s leaders:</em></p><p><strong>November 2020</strong></p><p><strong>Mark Zuckerberg <br>Sheryl Sandberg <br>Anne Heraty (CEO, CPL/Covalen) <br>Julie Sweet (CEO, Accenture) <p>Via email and posting on Facebook’s Workplace channels </p></strong></p><div><p><strong>Open letter from content moderators re: pandemic <br></strong><br>Dear Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg, Ms. Heraty, Ms. Sweet </p><p>We, the undersigned Facebook content moderators and Facebook employees, write to express our dismay at your decision to risk our lives—and the lives of our colleagues and loved ones—to maintain Facebook’s profits during the pandemic. </p></div><p>After months of allowing content moderators to work from home, faced with intense pressure to keep Facebook free of hate and disinformation, you have forced us back to the office. Moderators who secure a doctors’ note about a personal COVID risk have been excused from attending in person.[1] Moderators with vulnerable relatives, who might die were they to contract COVID from us, have not. </p><p>The pandemic has been good for Facebook. More than 3 billion people have now joined Facebook services, creating more demand for our work than ever.[2] Mr. Zuckerberg nearly doubled his fortune during the crisis.[3] He is now worth well over $100 billion. It has been good for Facebook’s contractors, too: CPL, one of the main European contractors, is due to be sold for €318m.[4] </p><p>Despite vast sums flowing to each of you as corporate executives, you have refused moderators hazard pay. A content moderator at Accenture’s office in Austin, Texas generally earns $18/hour[5]. </p><p>Before the pandemic, content moderation was easily Facebook’s most brutal job. We waded through violence and child abuse for hours on end. Moderators working on child abuse content had targets increased during the pandemic, with no additional support. </p><p>Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone. In several offices, multiple COVID cases have occurred on the floor.[6] Workers have asked Facebook leadership, and the leadership of your outsourcing firms like Accenture and CPL, to take urgent steps to protect us and value our work. You refused. We are publishing this letter because we are left with no choice. </p><p>Stop Needlessly Risking Moderators’ Lives </p><p>It is important to explain that the reason you have chosen to risk our lives is that this year Facebook tried using ‘AI’ to moderate content—and failed.[7] </p><p>At the start of the pandemic, both full-time Facebook staff and content moderators worked from home. To cover the pressing need to moderate the masses of violence, hate, terrorism, child abuse, and other horrors that we fight for you every day, you sought to substitute our work with the work of a machine. </p><p>Without informing the public, Facebook undertook a massive live experiment in heavily automated content moderation. Management told moderators that we should no longer see certain varieties of toxic content coming up in the review tool from which we work— such as graphic violence or child abuse, for example. </p><p>The AI wasn’t up to the job. Important speech got swept into the maw of the Facebook filter—and risky content, like self-harm, stayed up. </p><p>The lesson is clear. Facebook’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically. They may never get there. </p><p>This raises a stark question. If our work is so core to Facebook’s business that you will ask us to risk our lives in the name of Facebook’s community—and profit—are we not, in fact, the heart of your company? </p><p>Without our work, Facebook is unusable. Its empire collapses. Your algorithms cannot spot satire. They cannot sift journalism from disinformation. They cannot respond quickly enough to self-harm or child abuse. We can. </p><p>Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral. </p><p>These are our demands. </p><p>1. Keep moderators and their families safe. At the moment, only individual content moderators with a doctors’ note indicating that they are high risk are excused from working in the office. Even this is not offered in some workplaces. Those who live with an at-risk person – who have, for example, a child with epilepsy – have been forced to come in. All content moderators who are high risk or who live with someone who is high risk for Covid should be permitted to work from home indefinitely. </p><p>2. Maximize at-home working. Work that can be done from home should continue to be done from home. You have previously said content moderation cannot be performed remotely for security reasons. If that is so, it is time to fundamentally change the way that the work is organized. There is a pervasive and needlessly secretive culture at Facebook. Some content, such as content that is criminal, may need to be moderated in Facebook offices. The rest should be done at home. </p><p>3. Offer hazard pay. If you want moderators to risk their lives to maintain ‘community’ and profit, you should pay. Moderators who are working in the office on high-risk material (eg, child abuse) should be paid hazard pay of 1.5x their usual wage. </p><p>4. End outsourcing. There is, if anything, more clamor than ever for aggressive content moderation at Facebook. This requires our work. Facebook should bring the content moderation workforce in house, giving us the same rights and benefits as full Facebook staff. </p><p>5. Offer real healthcare and psychiatric care. Facebook employees enjoy various benefits, including private health insurance and visits to psychiatrists. Content moderators, who bear the brunt of the mental health trauma associated with Facebook’s toxic content, are offered 45 minutes a week with a ‘wellness coach’. These ‘coaches’ are generally not psychologists or psychiatrists and are contractually forbidden from diagnosis or treatment. And they generally cannot build a relationship of trust with moderators, since workers know that Facebook management (and Accenture/CPL management) ask ‘coaches’ to reveal confidential details of counselling sessions. Moderators deserve at least as much mental and physical health support as full Facebook staff. </p><p>The current crisis highlights that at the core of Facebook’s business lies a deep hypocrisy. By outsourcing our jobs, Facebook implies that the 35,000 of us who work in moderation are somehow peripheral to social media. Yet we are so integral to Facebook’s viability that we must risk our lives to come into work. </p><p>It is time to reorganize Facebook’s moderation work on the basis of equality and justice.

November 18, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/vue-vs-react-best-choice-for-startups/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/vue-vs-react-best-choice-for-startups/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-f94c7cca=""> <!----> <div data-v-0cf44990="" data-v-f94c7cca=""><div><p>A former front-end student of mine (Zoe*) recently emailed me, and honestly wanted to understand why is it that I chose to code <a href="http://swimm.io/">Swimm</a>, with Vue.Js and not React:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I just have one question for you: Why Vue?[...] I hope you're not rolling your eyes thinking - “ah no, another question about Vue”. Although knowing you and your passion, I'm sure you have a pretty strong opinion that could swallow me into becoming a Vue fan without even knowing it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vue.js gained a reputation in recent years as an edgy must-know framework, but developers often question what the hype is about, how it relates to them and what web framework they should choose for their product.</p>
<p>While there might be some over-hype around the expected <a href="https://madewithvuejs.com/blog/vue-3-roundup#:~:text=Vue%203%20release%20date,2020%2C%20according%20to%20the%20roadmap.">Vue 3 release due in Q3 2020</a>, Vue has been gaining traction for a few years now, and it was just a matter of time for <a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/13-top-companies-that-have-trusted-vue.js-examples-of-applications">bigger companies</a> like Netflix, Behance, Grammarly, Alibibaba, GitLab and others, to pick it up. Yet according to <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-wanted2">Stackoverflow’s 2020 developer</a> React.js is still the most wanted web framework (Vue.js coming in second).</p>
<h3>Vue.js vs React In a Nutshell</h3>
<p>I first used Vue at <a href="https://www.imcreator.com/">IM Creator</a>, a product I co-built originally with JQuery, and Vue was a breath of crisp air in my face. It was user friendly and progressive as it enabled me to use the framework for specific parts each time, without huge migrations. I could then for example create a menu in Vue, while the rest remained in legacy JQuery. What’s there not to like?</p>
<p>With Swimm (a new dev tool product) it wasn't even a question. I started our PoC with Vue.js and continued since then to our Beta self-served version. Several benefits should speak volumes to Startups these days especially compared to React:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vue is Lightweight and Flexible</strong>. It means it's a framework that feels more like a library than a framework at all. You can try it out first in small use cases in your app before going all-in.</li>
<li><strong>Vue is less intrusive than React</strong> and much easier to onboard. Project components and structure in Vue are similar whie projects in React each vary in architecture and implementation. I find that you can recognize Vue structures easily which is what speeds up onboarding time for any developer learning a new codebase. Vue becomes easier to maintain. This is especially true for smaller products.</li>
<li><strong>Readability is key</strong> - Vue is based on the most basic principles of the Web and is more readable than React. The html/css and JS are separate while in React everything is in JS.</li>
<li><strong>Indie at its core</strong>. While it’s my personal opinion, many developers appreciate tools that are not backed by tech giants (for example React backed by Facebook, and Angular by Google), but rather grows from a community and that is why it is highly oriented to developer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When does React Trump Vue.js:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>React is still most wanted by the industry</strong>. That can be a problem for new coders. From my recent experience recruiting for Swimm’s growing dev team, Vue is still harder to recruit for because of React’s persistent popularity. <strong>By the same token</strong>, even if many of the larger companies are picking it up, it’s still part of side projects and not the main product. This is why for the <a href="https://www.itc.tech/">ITC.tech</a> web-dev Bootcamp, I created a React-based curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility in some aspects</strong>. React still has the ability to split between the visibility of a component and maintenance of the component - and still provides more flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Docs are light years ahead</strong>. The features Release in React is fast paced and as React docs are extensive and elaborate. [Try skimming through all of the 500 pages of questions on React on Stackoverflow].</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>To Sum it Up: A Note to Zoe</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“ Hi Zoë,</p>
<p>I chose Vue for many reasons.</p>
<p>It is easy to integrate into existing projects (That was my need the first time I used Vue)</p>
<p>It is has a more readable syntax</p>
<p>It's really reactive (no need to explicitly call the set function)</p>
<p>It is not maintained by a big company (Facebook / Google)[...]</p>
<p>Give it a try :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course there is always a trade-off. These lessons learned reflect my personal views, insight gained from working in various startups and alongside numerous tech clients. As always, <a href="https://www.mindk.com/blog/react-vs-vue/">in depth research</a> is required to make sure which framework best suits your business case. But if you’re looking for a flexible  non-enterprise solution, Vue has proved easy to learn, scalable, user-friendly backed by a solid community that caters to other developers.</p>

	  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - I co-authored an O’Reilly book with my colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/lak_gcp" target="_blank">Lak</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/munnm/" target="_blank">Mike</a>! You can <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-design/9781098115777/" target="_blank">order it here</a> and 100% of the royalties go to <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>. This post is about the writing process.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-to-write">Deciding to write</h3>

<p>Back in January of this year, Lak graciously reached out to me asking if I was interested in co-writing an O’Reilly book on machine learning. As I read the email, my reaction was almost an immediate no because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It sounded like something that would take a lot of time.</li>
  <li>With a quickly evolving field like ML, wouldn’t a book be obsolete before it hit the shelves?</li>
</ul>

<p>I let Lak’s request sit in my inbox for a few days even though I was sure I had made up my mind, because saying no to projects is much harder than saying yes. A few days later on a long car ride with my fiancé, I mentioned the book offer in passing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You have an opportunity to write a book and you’re saying <em>no</em>?” he said, nearly pulling off the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose I had considered this offer as more of a <strong>burden</strong>, but from his perspective it was an <strong>opportunity</strong>. Ok, he wouldn’t be the one writing it, but he has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-Embedded-Linux-Systems-Techniques-dp-0596529686/dp/0596529686" target="_blank">written</a> an O’Reilly book before!</p>

<p>It would no doubt be hard, but it also provided a chance to learn a lot along the way and have a book at the end of it. With his advice in mind, I decided to learn more about the book before saying no. The plan for the book was to catalog a series of patterns, each of which would outline a common challenge in ML and provide some approaches for solving it. I was intrigued, but some doubts started to creep in as I read through the pattern ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I was very familiar with some, but much less so with others. Didn’t I need to have all this knowledge in my head before writing for this to work?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why me? Why was I qualified to do this? Objectively, I have created a lot of ML content over the years to educate app developers, data scientists, and customers. I’d like to think I’m a decent writer, but a book? That seemed like a different beast, and I wasn’t sure I was the best person for the job.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There can always be a million reasons not to do something, but I ultimately decided to ignore them all and give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="starting-with-an-idea">Starting with an idea</h3>

<p>This happened before I joined the project, so I asked Lak what he did before reaching out to O’Reilly with the idea for the book. Publishers get cold proposals all the time, so it helps if you can clearly communicate what the book will be about and show that you know what you will be writing about.</p>

<p>In our case, Lak wrote a couple of blog posts on machine learning design patterns (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ml-design-pattern-1-transform-9e82ccbc3209">Transform</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ml-design-pattern-2-checkpoints-e6ca25a4c5fe">Checkpoints</a>) to gauge whether readers were interested in this idea. They were, but he realized that readers’ interest was very much in how to implement, adapt, and extend these patterns. He also did a talk on the topic at a couple of conferences and discovered that conference attendees were a bit different – they needed a clear explanation of the reason to use the pattern and a prescriptive approach to addressing the problem. In other words, readers who knew the pattern beforehand wanted a technical manual, while conference attendees (who were being introduced to the pattern for the first time) wanted to know why the pattern matters. This helped him write the next set of blog posts, where he started with a crisp problem statement, a canonical solution, and a couple of variations.</p>

<p>Once he had a good idea of how to communicate ML design patterns, Lak reached out to an O’Reilly editor with a short message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a <a href="https://link.medium.com/7BSgxXdts1">list</a> of about 20 machine learning design patterns that I want to write about. Do you think they would do well as a book? If so, I can see about finding a co-author who would be interested in expanding on these…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editor replied that since O’Reilly has a solid franchise in design patterns, he was very interested. He was assigned an acquisitions editor who would work with us to craft the actual proposal. And that’s when Lak reached out to me to see if I was interested in co-authoring.</p>

<h3 id="building-an-outline">Building an outline</h3>

<p>I knew nothing about writing a book going into this, and my first question was: how will we split up the work? Will we alternate paragraphs, sections, chapters, words? I’m sure this varies for every book with multiple authors. We decided to split work by sections. In our case, each section was a design pattern and each chapter had 3-6 patterns. We started by making an outline, with an initial list of 20 patterns.</p>

<p>Chapters in our book are organized by different phases in a typical machine learning workflow. We first determined the topic for each chapter, and then came up with the patterns we wanted to be included in it. In the outline, each pattern had a 1-2 sentence description. It took a few iterations of adding and removing patterns and moving some between chapters before we had something we were happy with. We finished this process with a total of 30 patterns split across 6 chapters, with 2 additional chapters for an intro and conclusion. This brought us to the end of February.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-a-book-proposal">Submitting a book proposal</h3>

<p>The first step in the publishing process for many books is writing a proposal and submitting it to an acquisitions editor. Acquisitions editors are in charge of reviewing proposals, providing feedback, and deciding whether a proposal will move to the next stage in the approval process. They also work on overall content strategy, deciding which topics they want to cover. Sometimes people reach out to them cold, and other times these editors may proactively reach out to prospective authors.</p>

<p>The proposal (which includes the outline, but also comparisons with existing titles, and who the intended audience is) went through a few rounds of feedback (which is where I joined the process), including detailed technical feedback, before getting approved. The acquisitions editor focuses on acquiring new content, so once ours got approved we moved to the next step in the process which was working with a development editor. This person was our main point of contact throughout the writing process – more on that in the next section.</p>

<p>I recently had a great conversation with our acquisitions editor, where I learned a lot more about the publishing industry and how this all works. One thing from this conversation especially stood out: she mentioned she <em>rarely</em> receives a cold book proposal from a woman, and she gets many cold proposals each day. I’m sharing this data (with her permission) in hopes that it encourages more women with book ideas to just go for it. Reach out! You’ve got nothing to lose. If your proposal gets rejected, you’ll likely still get some feedback in the process.</p>

<h3 id="writing-time">Writing time</h3>

<p>I assumed we’d begin at the beginning, but we started by writing Chapter 2. Chapter 1 didn’t have any patterns – it was meant to be an overview of the entire book, explain our goals, and set the stage for the intended audience. Without anything written yet this would be hard to write, so we got right into patterns by starting with Chapter 2. Before sitting down to write this chapter, we took our short Chapter 2 outline and worked together to expand it. This is something we did before every chapter, with the goals of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring the three of us had the same understanding of each pattern</li>
  <li>Agreeing on what should and shouldn’t be covered</li>
  <li>Splitting up the writing by pattern</li>
</ul>

<p>Early on in the outline process, we had decided each pattern should follow the same structure. If you’re reading the book, you’ll notice that every pattern is split into the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem</strong>: describes the ML challenge a pattern addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Solution</strong>: describes one approach to solving the problem, including code snippets and recommended tooling for solving the problem</li>
  <li><strong>Tradeoffs and Alternatives</strong>: extended discussion on the pattern, including tools not covered in the Solution section, potential gotchas, and related solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a structure for each section was extremely useful in ensuring consistency throughout the book.</p>

<p>After outlining Chapter 2 in detail, I had two patterns assigned to me and it was finally time to write. I wish I could tell you this is the part where I sat down at my desk, closed the door, and let the insights flow onto the page. This is how I’d always imagined book writing went. For better or worse (and maybe because the outside world went into chaos while this was happening), my process went more like this:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My writing process:</p><p>* Write 2 sentences<br>* My glasses are splotchy, where are the lens wipes?<br>* Edit the last sentence I wrote<br>* Research the latest keyboards<br>* Write another 2 sentences<br>* Refill water, clean the counter<br>* Stare at my now perfect paragraph<br>* Open Twitter</p></div>— Sara Robinson (@SRobTweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/SRobTweets/status/1244312122613473281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>It wasn’t a very efficient way to start, but it got the job done and over time my process improved. I also quickly debunked my initial question:</p>

<p><em>Didn’t I need to have all this knowledge in my head before writing for this to work?</em></p>

<p>Even if I did have experience implementing a particular pattern, I couldn’t write only what I already knew. I had to do a considerable amount of research before I started writing the bulk of each pattern to find out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What writing on this topic already existed?</li>
  <li>Are there any important research papers that cover this?</li>
  <li>What tools are available for solving this pattern?</li>
</ul>

<p>With all this research I started to have some doubts. If I was just collating information from various sources, was I providing anything useful? Then I thought about some of my favorite non-fiction books and realized most of them work by:</p>

<p><em>Presenting existing, relevant information + adding a unique angle</em></p>

<p>I’ve met with a lot of customers and seen production use of ML, and I’ve also built demos to help developers understand how to use different ML tools. Turns out I did have a unique angle! Before writing I did a lot of reading to make sure I fully understood the ins and outs of the pattern. Then I had enough information to write. I still wouldn’t say the words flowed at this point, but I did slowly get …</p></div></div>

On a good day, these calls are tense, but more often than not theyâ€™re explosive. Only my camera is turned on, and I watch myself try to look optimistic.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a mediator. I have helped people have difficult conversations for more than 20 years: in conflict zones and in living rooms, with leaders of corporations and foundations, and people in my own community. If youâ€™ve ever avoided or postponed a difficult conversation, youâ€™re not alone. Conflict avoidance is everywhere. At home and at work, we steer around conflict as prodigiously as we create it.</p>
<p>And yet conflict isnâ€™t inherently bad. It offers us information about how we could work with others more effectively, improve our relationships, and grow as individuals. Itâ€™s far worse to try to avoid it, because you just end up creating new conflict â€“ which ends up being more insidious and costly than the original issue.</p>
<p>When I help people have difficult conversations, weâ€™re always aiming for one of three outcomes: a solution, a plan or an understanding. A solution is a grand bargain, a resounding win, a comprehensive resolution expected to withstand the pressures of all unknown future challenges. With a mediator this can happen, but itâ€™s ambitious. We all have a tendency to hope for a dramatic and permanent solution, but this usually causes new problems by overburdening an already stressed relationship. A plan is more realistic, and is like a map for finding a solution. It leaves the precise terms of the resolution open-ended but provides a path forward. A plan reorganises the relationship with new boundaries, revised norms, and sets up shared expectations for how the trickiest parts will be navigated.</p>
<p>But the <em>most</em> realistic outcome, especially at the beginning, is to focus on reaching an understanding. An understanding is a new awareness of what the other person has experienced in the conflict; itâ€™s a mutual appreciation for one anotherâ€™s needs, fears and hopes. Reaching an understanding is feasible, provides great relief, and can lay a foundation for a plan, a solution and a new relationship.</p>
<p>For example, I recently helped a family to reach an understanding when the COVID-19 pandemic forced a college student to move back in with his parents. They were having difficulties renegotiating their relationships once they were suddenly living together again. Their renewed understanding led to a plan for new expectations and boundaries, which theyâ€™re currently using to navigate the uncertainties and discomfort of this period. I expect theyâ€™ll find their solution soon.</p>
<p>In my work as a mediator, Iâ€™ve learnt that successful conversations always involve what I call a â€˜gem statementâ€™. When two parties have listened long and hard to each other â€“ have made the heroic effort to listen curiously and empathically even when they disagree strenuously â€“ someone eventually unearths a glowing, priceless gem. It usually takes the form of a short, powerful statement, such as these two Iâ€™ve heard recently:</p>
<blockquote>Weâ€™ve kept on fighting in part because neither of us is willing to walk away from this friendship. Thatâ€™s something.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Even when we canâ€™t agree on Dadâ€™s medical care, Iâ€™ve never doubted your good intentions. I know you want the best for him.</blockquote>
<p>It happens almost every time. From the muck of blame and anger, someone lifts out a beacon. I then seize the opportunity and hold up the gleaming gem for all parties to see. It lights the way toward a new conversation revolving around compromise, solutions and goodwill.</p>
<p>In addition to gratitude for the person who dug out the gem, I have also felt impatience. Iâ€™ve wondered, <em>Why canâ€™t they say something like this earlier in the process? Or better yet, at the beginning?</em> Does the conversation need to naturally find its way to such a moment, or could we engineer it to happen much sooner? It seemed worthwhile to find out, so I developed a process to reduce the amount of time people spend digging in the muck. And Iâ€™ve found it works: when people find a gem earlier on, they experience less pain and more benefit from having their difficult conversation.</p>
<p>This Guide is to help you do this â€“ without a mediator. Mediators can be helpful during challenging times, but we donâ€™t actually resolve peoplesâ€™ conflicts. We create the conditions in which people feel heard and acknowledged, increasing the quality of their communication and problem-solving. When youâ€™re facing a tough conversation, itâ€™s not really the mediator you need â€“ itâ€™s the conditions weâ€™re good at creating and maintaining.</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t feel safe or if your situation involves illegal activity or any type of abuse, this Guide isnâ€™t right for you. In those instances, get help from a professional right away. There are also some situations that donâ€™t call for further conversation â€“ some relationships or difficulties are better left in the past, and you should trust your instinct about whether a conversation is the right step for you. But if you think talking could do some good, then this resource can help get you started.</p>
<p>Maybe you feel misunderstood or unappreciated at work. Or maybe youâ€™re caught in a recurring family pattern that causes pain and drives you <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/a-family-rift-is-locked-on-the-past-heres-how-to-move-forward" rel="noopener">away</a> from the people you love. If you feel hurt or angry when thinking of a difficult conversation you need to have, there is a good chance that the relationship is important to you. Whether itâ€™s a relationship within your family, at work or in your community, itâ€™s become this challenging because you have a vested interest, you care deeply or your future is somehow intertwined with the person you need to talk with.</p>
<p>If you feel the situation could improve if someone <em>really heard</em> what you have to say, thereâ€™s hope. If you feel ready to make an earnest effort to <em>really hear</em> someone in return, thereâ€™s even more than hope. Remember that your goal here is not to find a quick solution or plan straight away â€“ thatâ€™s tempting but unrealistic, and might backfire. Your goal is to understand each other.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>1. Prepare for the conversation</strong></p>
<p>The first step is a thought experiment: think about the person with whom you need to talk, and allow yourself to imagine that you just finished having the best possible conversation with them. You were heard fully. Each of your concerns was addressed to your satisfaction. If an apology was appropriate, you received an excellent one. <em>Stay with this â€“ just imagine it!</em> Youâ€™ve reached an understanding that gives you confidence in the future of the relationship. <em>This is a challenging thought experiment, but youâ€™re almost thereâ€¦</em> You are relieved, you feel lighter, and even grateful to the person youâ€™ve been in conflict with.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dig out a gem</strong></p>
<p>What would you say to them in this moment? (Remember, in this exercise youâ€™ve been heard, youâ€™ve received an apology, and it went exceedingly well.) What would you say to your counterpart if all of that happened? Whatâ€™s â€˜underneathâ€™ the conflict? Whatâ€™s true when youâ€™re not consumed with negative feelings? Write down the first gem statement you think of. You can write others too, but usually the first one is the real deal.</p>
<p>Your statement should be an authentic expression of how youâ€™re feeling, but should also have significant meaning and positive impact for the other person. For example, two more gem statements I heard recently were: â€˜I can tell you care a lot about reaching our teamâ€™s goals, and I have a lot of respect for you<em>.</em>â€™ You can tell itâ€™s a gem when youâ€™re terribly tempted to tack on a grievance to the end of it. Like this: <em>I can tell you care a lot about reaching our teamâ€™s goals, </em><em><strong>but the way you go about it is causing great difficulty to everyone around you.</strong></em> If you find yourself doing this, leave out the second part. Youâ€™ll get to say it, just not here.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ask yourself if youâ€™re ready</strong></p>
<p>Are you willing to say the statement to them? We recoil from being generous and kind when we feel our counterpart doesnâ€™t deserve it. Moreover, making such statements can put us in an even more vulnerable position. If thatâ€™s the case, it might help to think of this another way. Uttering your gem statement is a temporary discomfort; the benefits youâ€™ll experience will be lasting and profound.</p>
<p>At this point, you should share this Guide with the other person. Even if you donâ€™t follow these steps closely or have the conversation right away, it will be helpful simply to both read the Guide and give thought to it. If you do proceed with a conversation, having this Guide in advance means that they will have undertaken this same process and unearthed a gem statement for you, which will likely mitigate your vulnerability and discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>4. Phone a friend</strong></p>
<p>Tell a friend who isnâ€™t involved in the conversation what youâ€™re going to do. The purpose is not to craft the gem statement together, and it isnâ€™t even to get their advice. Instead, say the four sentences below to your friend:</p><ul>
<li>The biggest emotion that Iâ€™m feeling toward the person I need to have a difficult conversation with isâ€¦</li>
<li>The biggest emotion that I expect the person is feeling toward me isâ€¦</li>
<li>The gem statement I will make to them isâ€¦</li>
<li>My hope for the conversation isâ€¦</li>
</ul><p>The fourth sentence â€“ identifying your hope for the conversation â€“ is a critical piece of your planning. Remember that the best initial outcome is achieving a new, shared understanding, rather than a comprehensive solution or a detailed plan. New understanding can bring you relief and allow space for forward movement, without expecting a miraculous resolution of all tension and …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Analysis of the data indicates a vaccine efficacy rate of 95% (p&lt;0.0001) in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (first primary objective) and also in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (second primary objective), in each case measured from 28 days after the first dose, 7 days after the second dose. The first primary objective analysis is based on 170 cases of COVID-19, as specified in the study protocol, of which 162 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 8 cases in the BNT162b2 group. Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics. The observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%.</p>  <p>There were 10 severe cases of COVID-19 observed in the trial, with nine of the cases occurring in the placebo group and one in the BNT162b2 vaccinated group. To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the Phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose were fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination. </p>  <p>In addition, the companies announced that the safety milestone required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been achieved. Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit a request within days to the FDA for an EUA based on the totality of safety and efficacy data collected to date, as well as manufacturing data relating to the quality and consistency of the vaccine. These data also will be submitted to other regulatory agencies around the world.</p>  <p>“The study results mark an important step in this historic eight-month journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end this devastating pandemic. We continue to move at the speed of science to compile all the data collected thus far and share with regulators around the world,” said <strong>Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO</strong>. “With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world.” </p>  <p>“We are grateful that the first global trial to reach the final efficacy analysis mark indicates that a high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 µg dose, underscoring the potential of BNT162 to provide early protection,” said <strong>Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech</strong>. “These achievements highlight the potential of mRNA as a new drug class. Our goal from the very beginning was to design and develop a vaccine that would generate rapid and potent protection against COVID-19 with a benign tolerability profile across all ages. We believe we have&nbsp;successfully accomplished this with our vaccine candidate BNT162b2 in all age groups studied so far and look forward to sharing further details with the regulatory authorities. I want to thank all the devoted women and men who contributed to this historically unprecedented achievement. We will continue to work with our partners and governments around the world to prepare for global distribution in 2020 and beyond.”</p>  <p>The Phase 3 clinical trial of BNT162b2 began on July 27 and has enrolled 43,661 participants to date, 41,135 of whom have received a second dose of the vaccine candidate as of November 13, 2020. Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age. A breakdown of the diversity of clinical trial participants can be found <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ad78-V3TIZpaI0hRxmiSbgkEJUyAXaiiyEL-ARI3BmSe5nBb577HWGg9iwQLkpFDr5Zut3MDUXtDp4gcUuk1TJMOdJQMV0I0rP8L9ghyxUs=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>from approximately 150 clinical trials sites in United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina. The trial will continue to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years. </p>  <p>Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses&nbsp;by the end of 2021. Four of Pfizer’s facilities are part of the manufacturing and supply chain; St. Louis, MO; Andover, MA; and Kalamazoo, MI in the U.S.; and Puurs in Belgium. BioNTech’s German sites will also be leveraged for global supply.</p>  <p>Pfizer is confident in its vast experience, expertise and existing cold-chain infrastructure to distribute the vaccine around the world. The companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers utilizing dry ice to maintain temperature conditions of -70°C±10°C. They can be used be as temporary storage units for 15 days by refilling with dry ice. Each shipper contains a GPS-enabled thermal sensor to track the location and temperature of each vaccine shipment across their pre-set routes leveraging Pfizer’s broad distribution network.</p>  <p>Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit the efficacy and safety data from the study for peer-review in a scientific journal once analysis of the data is completed.</p>  <p><strong>About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ Lives</strong><br>At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

	<p><i>November 18th 2020</i></p>

	<p>Six months ago, I set myself the goal of creating one tiny project each week.</p> 

	<p>My main aim was to get better at testing out all the ideas I had written down in my phone, but not actually done anything with.</p>

	<p>26 weeks later, and a quick glance of this website, you'll notice I've launched 6 things.</p>

	<p>Although I'm 20 projects short, it's not all bad. My projects are generating some passive income, I've gone from no online following, to a few hundred twitter followers, and I've had a great time building weird and wonderful internet things.</p>

	<p>In this post I'll give an update on how these projects are performing, and the pros and cons of launching micro-businesses.</p>

	<p>Let's rewind.</p>

	<h3>💡 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/tiny_website" target="_blank">Tiny Website</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>129,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Unique users: <b>58,000</b></i></li>
		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>348</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£10.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Tiny Projects was born the day after my 25th birthday. Project #1 is this bare-bones tiny website that you're reading right now.</p>

	<p>When it launched, the only content on this website was a blog post, a guide on making tiny websites, and an update about my goals.</p>

	<p>Randomly, I decided to submit my blog post "Tiny websites are great" onto Hacker News. Over the next 24 hours it hit the top of the front page, bringing 25k users to this site in its first day. It was absolutely thrilling.</p>

	<p>As a double whammy, the guide I'd produced also hit the top of the learn programming sub-reddit with 1.3k upvotes.</p>

	<p>Somehow, I'd managed to hit a homerun with no idea what I was doing. Pageviews, followers and emails were flying in fast. Anyone who has produced a bit of viral content on the internet will know, the dopamine rush is insane.</p> 

	<h3>🌐 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/silicon_valley_domain_names" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Domain names</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>28,500</b></i></li>

		<li><i>HN Upvotes: <b>410</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£76.25</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Funnily enough, my second Tiny Project was the only one I actually completed in a week. Spurred on by the previous project, I was keen to replicate my success.</p>

	<p>I wanted to investigate domain names. Specifically, was it possible to buy a google.x domain name? It was an investigative piece with a bit of coding sprinkled in.</p>

	<p>Completing this project in a week was gruelling. My day-job was neglected, and I pulled some very long hours. However, 7 days later, I hit publish on my second blog post: "I bought netflix.soy".</p>

	<p>Again, I posted it on Hacker News. It became the most viral thing I've written.</p>

	<p>The Tiny Projects website received 28k page views, and the post got 410 upvotes. Hundreds of followers and emails again poured in.</p>

	<p>Writing two viral pieces back-to-back made me question what I was really doing. Somehow I'd  stumbled into writing click-baity blog posts for Hacker News instead of building tiny projects.</p>

	<p>6 months on, I still own all the domains I purchased for this project except the Facebook one. Damn you Zuck.</p>

	<p>For my third tiny project, I decided I wanted to make an online game.</p>

	<p>With minimal knowledge of Unity, I cobbled together a tiny battle royale game called "Wee Royale" in 2 weeks and launched it on Android.</p>

	<p>Posting this project write up on Hacker News got zero attention. I expected this, as it didn't really fit the usual HN content, but I was still disappointed. My brain had been jaded by the massive numbers of the first two posts.</p>

	<p>Wee Royale currently has 25 downloads on the Google Play Store. I'm actually not sure if the game still works though.</p>

	<p>Overall, Wee Royale was a flop, but it was hilarious to play it with my friends.</p>

	<h3>🛍️ <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>1,500</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Stores: <b>1,400</b></i></li>
		<li><i>PH Upvotes: <b>83</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Revenue: <b>£1.63</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>£41.00</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>With a minimalist design, and the tag line "just sell your stuff", One Item Store lets anyone create an online shop in minutes to sell their goods.</p>

	<p>After two weeks of building my micro e-commerce platform, I launched it on Product Hunt. At the end of the day I finished on the homepage with 83 upvotes.</p>

	<p>Today, people have created over 1400 stores, selling everything from t-shirts, to human beings. I've seen some very strange things.</p>

	<p>In total, £163.09 has flowed through One Item Store checkouts, mainly from a car dealership in Australia offering deals throughout the pandemic. I take a small 1% fee on every transaction, netting me a small fortune of £1.63.</p>

	<p>Although its not a significant amount, this was my first Tiny Projects internet money! The best thing is, One Item Store makes money without me having to do anything.</p>

	<p>One Item Store is a Tiny Project I'd like to continue building. My next step would be to add some better checkout designs, and make the website look a bit more legit.</p>

	<h3>📗 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/snormal" target="_blank">Snormal</a></h3>
	<ul>

	</ul>

	<p>Snormal is a social network for everything that doesn't make it onto your Instagram highlight reel. A typical post on Snormal is something like: "Dude, I just ate a whole baguette in bed".</p>

	<p>I launched Snormal with zero intentions of making any money. It was a bit of a social experiment to see if people were becoming as jaded with social media as me.</p>

	<p>After 1 month of building, and an accidental Product Hunt launch, Snormal has gone on to gain 200 registered users, who have scrolled 4432 times on the discover feed.</p>

	<p>Its incredibly fun running a micro-social network.</p>

	<p>Two weeks after Snormal launched, I hadn't implemented comments on posts. When I finally added them, it felt godlike letting people finally talk to each other.</p>

	<p>Growth on Snormal slowly increasing. For some strange reason it has become popular in Portugal. Have a scroll now, and you'll see loads of statuses in Portugese.</p>

	<h3>💸 <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/earlyname" target="_blank">Earlyname</a></h3>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Page views: <b>10,000</b></i></li>

		<li><i>MRR: <b>$200.00</b></i></li>
		<li><i>Cost: <b>$108.20</b></i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Earlyname helps you claim rare usernames (like @ben or @alice) on new, emerging social platforms. Currently it is generating $200/month.</p>

	<p>Running Earlyname is so much fun. I get to talk with founders, try out new products, do a bit of web scraping/automation, and find rare usernames for people.</p>

	<p>The only downside is that it requires my input every month to produce a new email. I'm anxious for the month I can't find any new social platforms.</p>

	<p>At present, Earlyname has 1500 subscribers on its email list, a number which thankfully seems to be growing naturally.</p>

	<p>Although its currently only at $200/mo, its cool to think Earlyname is generating $2k/year. My plan is to keep plugging away launching monthly newsletters and see how high that monthly revenue number can get.</p>

	<h3>👍 Positives of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>I believe there's a big advantage to this "micro-bet" approach of launching many tiny businesses, and then sticking with the ones that become successful.</p>

	<p>Firstly, it drastically reduces the risk of putting too much time into an idea that doesn't quite work. Even if you stumbled across a decent idea that did work, what if there's an amazing one just around the corner? It keeps you on your toes.</p>

	<p>Creating lots of tiny businesses also keeps things fun and interesting. This is probably the most important factor for me.</p>

	<p>Feeling obligued to keep building something that you've sunk hundreds of hours into but no longer enjoy sounds like my personal hell.</p>

	<p>With tiny projects, the stakes are so low, I can kill a project with no guilt and build something else, or just bounce between the projects I want to work on.</p>

	<h3>👎 Negatives of Tiny Projects</h3>

	<p>My original plan was to launch one tiny project each week, however I've realised this is an insane schedule. You can't build or document anything meaningful in this time.</p>

	<p>This schedule might be possible if I treated Tiny Projects full-time like a YouTuber. But, I don't think going all in on Micro-SaaS businesses would be very fun with the revenue they're currently generating.</p>

	<p>1-2 months is a more reasonable tiny project timeframe. It gives you enough time to build something with substance, and test the idea thoroughly.</p>

	<p>One major downside of launching lots of things is that you become way too happy to give up on a project when it doesn't show instant success.</p>

	<p>Perhaps if I spent more time on marketing, or slightly pivoted a project, I could see more success. Currently, I'm more inclined to just start something new.</p>

	<p>Maintaining lots of software can also become a bit of a burden. Once the domain name renewal date comes around, I'll have to make some decisions as to whether a project lives on for another year or not.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions &amp; The Future</h3>

	<p>I feel like I'm trying to learn the skill of generating better ideas, and rapidly building and launching them into a business.</p>

	<p>I try to think about this process like going for a run. The more runs I do, the faster and fitter I'll be. The more projects I launch, the better and more profitable they'll be.</p>

	<p>How often does someone build &amp; launch a business in their lifetime? I'm hoping that by doing this process over and over again, I'll discover some really interesting things.</p>
	
	<p>My main goal for the next six months of Tiny Projects is to learn how to get better at making money on the internet from my projects.</p>

	<p>A Product Hunt launch can easily get you a spike in traffic, but afterwards I really don't know what I'm doing. There's this whole other level afterwards called "sales &amp; marketing" that I want to master.</p>

	<p>Another goal is to also be more consistent with my writing. Hopefully, this ultimately means you'll be hearing a lot more things from me!</p>

	<p>It was nice to catch up.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In this series of articles, I will show full process of creating a UI design for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Batch Image Shrinker</a> (<a href="market://details?id=net.amortizedcost.batchimageshrinker">Google play link</a>) mobile application which I did by myself. As a software developer always I've been thinking that UI design is not for me, that it's complex and requires some art skill or something.</p>
<p>It's a myth and I will try to debunk it.</p>
<p>I will show you that UI design is for everyone, you just need to know some basic technics and a couple of tricks.</p>
<p>It's not going to be easy, but I promise you it will be very interesting.</p>
<h2 id="dominatingcolor">Dominating color</h2>
<p>With the dominating presence of dark-mode, I noticed that for me it was easier to work with darker colors as baseline colors than with brighter ones, and since  I almost always use dark-mode of the applications, so I wanted to have something similar in my application. I was certain that I didn't want to use <a href="https://colornames.org/color/3b5998">Facebook blue</a> color and it's successors, so I had to find something more futuristic and brave than that. My choice fell on <code>#464d77</code> which is a very intense dark blue, almost purple color.</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-17-at-20.10.09"></p>
<p>Common advice here will be not to use pure black or white colors, which, as perfectly described in <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">the article</a>, hardly present in the real-world color pallet. <em>What a coincidence, I found <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect.html">a website</a> with a perfect example of dark background color and great content to read.</em></p>
<h2 id="colorpalette">Color palette</h2>
<p>Of cause, just one baseline color will not be enough to build a feature-rich application. You will need a couple of colors for different types of components like buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. Another one or two colors will be needed for the text itself. Also,  some gradients for several states of a component, such as "active", "disabled", "pressed". So before creating an actual UI, we will need to have a rich pallet of colors to work with. In my case, I ended up with 6 colors in total which was more than enough to create a simple yet interesting UI.</p>
<p>This step is much easier than the previous one, because here we will be either reusing or generating new color pallets using the baseline color from the previous part.</p>
<p>The generator which I was using is <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/popular/f9db6d">this</a>. Here you could either put the color hex into a search bar or simply choose the pallet from the <a href="https://coolors.co/a1e8af-94c595-747c92-372772-3a2449">hundreds</a> of pre-generated ones. If the color range is not enough for you, try to extend it with <a href="https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette">another</a> good palette generator. Put on the left side the baseline color and select how many colors you will need.</p>
<p>Pro-tip, you can combine those tools to get even more combinations. As you can see here, I was using a baseline color on the right side and colors from <a href="https://coolors.co/464d77-36827f-f9db6d-f4eded-877666">the palette</a> as values for the right side of the generator:</p>
<p><img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.50.31"><br>
<img src="http://amortizedcost.net/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-11-16-at-23.51.04"></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the results try to get back to choosing the baseline color and repeat the whole process again. Since we are learning it's ok to do multiple roundtrips until your gut feelings tell you that that is it.</p>
<p>Once we are done with the color schema we are good to go to we move to the next step - choosing fonts, which will be covered next time.</p>

November 18, 2020 | http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://whiteboard.ping.se/SDR/IQ">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikitext">
<p>This is a description of using I/Q Data (aka "analytic signal") representing a signal. Since the topic may be quite confusing, I've described the same thing here from different point of views. If you find the information somewhat redundant, it is because it is. Different views may appeal to different readers, and if something seems unclear, keep on reading and it may be more comprehensible later - hopefully.
</p>
<h2>Why I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>I/Q Data is a signal representation much more precise than just using a series of samples of the momentary amplitude of the signal. Have a look at the following signal below.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/cosample.png" alt="Plain signal" title="Plain signal"></p>
<p>This is what you may be used to work with. So why I/Q Data - isn't this good enough?
</p>
<p>Not really. We have a few problems here.
</p>
<ul><li>First, it is impossible to determine the frequency of this signal. Sure, it looks simple enough, just look at the period length? True, but you have no clue if it's a positive or negative frequency since they both generate the same curve. I.e. cos(x) = cos(-x). This becomes a problem working with the signal. Mixing (multiplying) two signals and it'll cause multiple solutions due to the uncertainty of the sign: f1 âŠ— f2 equals f1 + f2 as well as f1 - f2.
</li><li>Second, it's hard to determine the power (peak amplitude, envelope) of the signal. Basically you can only see the peak amplitude here at 0Â°, 180Â°, 360Â° etc, and how do you know the power is the same everywhere else as well? And did you sample the signal exactly at its peak? You really don't know.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data solves this. Instead of looking at the signal as a flat curve as above, look at it as a corkscrew (helix, spiral, coil spring) in three dimensions.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkscrew.png" alt="Complex signal" title="Complex signal"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now if you look at this curve from the side, you'll actually get the same graph as the first one above. Your "real" signal actually is this 2D projection of this corkscrew signal. This is your "I" in I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkI.png" alt="Side view" title="Side view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now have a look at the corkscrew from above. This looks quite similar, but as you see, it is out of phase 90Â°  starting at zero, not at one as the other. This this the Q part of your I/Q data.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkQ.png" alt="Top view" title="Top view"></p>
<hr>
<p>Now looking at the corkscrew down the time axis you'll see it winds counter-clockwise. This means we know the frequency is positive. It could have wound clockwise as well, still generating the same I-signal (projection) but different Q-signal, representing a negative frequency.
</p>
<p>You also see that the radius of the corkscrew is constant at every sample, if small in I large in Q and vice versa. The radius is the peak amplitude of your signal. 
</p>
<p>The axes are of course 90Â°, so the radius must be equal to (IÂ²+QÂ²)<sup>1/2</sup>. This is the peak amplitude of your signal, and as you can see you know this for each and every sample.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/corkT.png" alt="Viewed down time axis" title="Viewed down time axis"></p>
<h2>What is I/Q Data?</h2>
<p>AS you now understand, the I/Q Data Sample is the coordinates of your signal as seen down the time axis of the corkscrew.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/onesample.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>You might object that your signal isn't a pure cosine function as the one we have shown here, and it might be very true. Still, every single sample of your signal can be described as such, i.e. with a peak amplitude times cosine of some phase angle.
</p>
<p>Every single point of your signal can be described as the function Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you may freely chose any amplitude A and angle Ï• this must of course be true (as long as the signal is continuous). The value of Aâ‹…cos(Ï•) is the <strong>I</strong> component of the I/Q signal, i.e. your real signal. Note that this only describes your signal in one single point, i.e. one sample. Next sample gives you a new I and Q very likely resulting in another amplitude and/or phase angle, reflecting the modulation of the signal.
</p>
<h2>One sample I/Q Data</h2>
<p>Ok, lets take one sample of I/Q Data and see what it represents. This is also called a phase vector, or phasor.
</p>
<pre>I = 0.69
Q = 0.40
</pre>
<p>Lets draw this in the complex plane.
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/iqdraw1.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Lets see what this tells us about our data point.
</p>
<ul><li>The momentary amplitude of our real signal is by definition <strong>I</strong>, i.e. 0.69
</li><li>Pythagoras tells us the amplitude A of the cosine wave is <code>(0.69Â²+0.40Â²)<sup>1/2</sup> = 0.8</code>
</li><li>Trigonometry tells us our angle is +30Â° into our cosine wave.
</li></ul><p>- <em>Hold it</em>, you say, <em>what cosine wave?</em>
</p>
<p>Well, I/Q actually assumes your real signal (<strong>I</strong>, that is) can be described as the
function <strong>I</strong> = Aâ‹…cos(Ï•)
</p>
<p>Since you are free to chose A and Ï• this must of course be true, as long the function is continuous. Remember we are looking at one single sample now, i.e. one point in time.
</p>
<p>So by using IQ Data we not only get the momentary values of our signal, but the function generating it as well. If we put above together we get:
</p>
<p>The real signal I = 0.8â‹…cos(30Â°)
</p>
<hr>
<ul><li>I/Q Data is the representation (data type) of this cosine function.
</li></ul><p>I/Q Data is the rectangular representation of the polar notation we used above. There is a unique transformation between the two, and the different notations have different properties calculating with them. The rectangular form of I/Q Data is chosen due to the ease of hardware implementations of the most common operations.
</p>
<p>I/Q Data consists of I and Q represented as two separate variables, a vector of length two, or more often, the complex number  I + Q<em>i</em>  (yes, I is the real part).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/polrep.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Note that the Amplitude above is the waves peak amplitude, not the momentary amplitude.
</p>
<ul><li>I is the current momentary amplitude of the signal (i.e. the Real signal)
</li><li>Q is the momentary amplitude of the signal phase shifted -90Â°.
</li></ul><p>For a simple function such as sine, the phase shift is what the signal was earlier in time, but for a signal with more than one sine component, Q reflects a -90Â° shift of the individual components, and not the composite signal as such. To convert a Real Signal to a I/Q Data Signal, discrete Fourier transformation is required (Hilberts transform).
</p>
<h2>Different ways of representing the same I/Q Data Sample</h2>
<p>There are at least three common ways to represent the I/Q Data Sample. Different representations gives you different pros and cons. Some are more easy to add, other are more easy to multiply etc. This may be important in the implementation, resulting in less complex hardware/software using the best representation.
</p>
<h3>The rectangular form</h3>
<p>The I/Q Data on the form Q and I is called "rectangular" (or "Cartesian") form as it can be viewed as positions in a coordinate system. I and Q are the x and y axis respectively. This is the most common representation you are used to. This form is most common due the ease of modulating/demodulating it in hardware. More about that later.
</p>
<ul><li>As a complex number: I + Q<em>i</em>
</li><li>As a vector [I,Q]
</li><li>Or just the two plain variables I and Q
</li></ul><h3>The polar form</h3>
<ul><li>Amplitude and angle
</li></ul><p>I = Amplitudeâ‹…cos(angle) <br>Q = Amplitudeâ‹…sin(angle)
</p>
<p>The Amplitude is the peak amplitude of the cos (and sin) function, and the angle is how far into the period from zero to 360Â° you are (or 0 to 2Ï€ if you prefers radians).
</p>
<h3>Eulers form</h3>
<p>Since cos(Ï•) + iâ‹…sin(Ï•) = e<sup>iÏ•</sup> we can write our IQ sample as
</p>
<p><span> Ae<sup>iÏ•</sup> </span>
</p>
<p>This might (not?) be the most intuitive representation of the sample. Ï• rotates the angle as seen in the polar representation, and A is of course the amplitude. Realizing this, Eulers identity becomes obvious. Because Ï• is the rotation of the vector in the complex plane, rotating it half a turn, 180Â° or Ï€ radians, results in a real part of -1 and no imaginary part, hence:
</p>
<p><span> e<sup>Ï€i</sup>+1 = 0 </span>
</p>
<p><em>"The student should find this to be immediately obvious,</em> <br><em>otherwise he'll never be a first rate mathematician"</em>
</p>
<p><em>-- Carl Friedrich Gauss </em>
</p>
<h2>Positive versus negative frequency</h2>
<p>It is now easy to see that using I/Q we can represent the signal frequency either as positive or negative. Have a look at the two I/Q signals red and blue below to the left and compare them with their corresponding real projections. It is as obvious they differ in signs in I/Q, as it's impossible to determine the signs using only the real signal component (neither the I nor the Q projection separately).
</p>
<p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/freqsign.gif" alt="Positive versus negative frequencies" title="Positive versus negative frequencies"></p>
<p><span>(sidenote: I've put them slightly out of phase compared to each other since else they wouldn't be possible to distinguish at all in the real representation to the right. Also, please note I'm here, quiet unconventional, using the x axis in the phasor for the imaginary <strong>Q</strong>)</span>
</p>
<p>The same signal (well, more or less) in a 3D representation.
</p>
<p>The <strong>I</strong> components (side view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-i.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Q</strong> components (top view):
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-q.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The I/Q signals in 3D:
</p><p><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/sign-3d.png" alt="" title=""></p>
<p><a name="twopriceone" id="twopriceone"></a>
As the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem states you can only represent
frequencies up to <code>f/2</code> using a samplings rate of <code>f</code>. This is still true
using IQ Data, but since you now can represent negative frequencies
the signal spans <code>[-f/2..+f/2]</code> compared to <code>[0..+f/2]</code> using a â„�eal signal,
hence the range is in effect doubled. Using a
sampling rate of <code>f</code> and you now can represent a signal range of <code>f</code> as well.
Two to the price of one!
</p>
<h2>Mixing and multiplying signals</h2>
<p>Using real signals or IQ Signals gives different results when you multiply them. This is because using only the real component it's not possible to uniquely determine the phase angle of the signal, hence impossible to distinguish a positive frequency from a negative.
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-real.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using real"></span></p>
<p>Multiplying two signals f1 and f2 in the real domain:
</p>
<p><span> Â±f1 âŠ— Â±f2 = (Â±)f1 Â± f2 </span>
</p>
<p><span><img src="http://whiteboard.ping.se/uploads/SDR/mix-iq.png" alt="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q" title="Mixing 10 kHz with 3 kHz using I/Q"></span></p>
<p>Using IQ Data the signs are now given, and the result is unambiguous:
</p>
<p><span> f1 âŠ— f2 = f1 + f2 </span>
</p>

A frequency spectrum in the real domain usually never show the negative side, since it always must be symmetric around zero due to the uncertainty of the sign of the frequency of the real signal -- hence the parentheses around the sign of <code>f1</code> in the first formula mixing the real signals.

            <div>
                
<p>The heartbreak continues for those of us that relied on Sony’s websites to find and buy games or to research what was available. After <a href="https://delistedgames.com/sony-makes-it-official-playstation-3-psp-vita-removed-from-psn-website-between-october-21-and-26/">cutting out</a> older PlayStation content from the PlayStation Store over the past month, Sony’s eye has seemingly fallen on PlayStation.com and I find myself feeling gutted this morning. For those who didn’t use it regularly, PlayStation.com housed a gargantuan history of pages for North American PlayStation releases going all the way back to the original console from 1995. Up until this week you could easily find titles using the search box on the site but now anything before the PlayStation 4 returns a disappointing “<em>0 results found</em>“.</p>



<p>The older pages weren’t overflowing with info but they did offer some product details that I couldn’t easily find elsewhere. For newer games these pages also frequently retained links to the PlayStation Store which helped in my research. Even when they <em>were</em> on sale some games were just hard to find on the PlayStation Store while their PlayStation.com pages linked directly to them. Sometimes these pages were among the scant bits of evidence that I could find to confirm these games even existed digitally. Now, like with the changes to the PlayStation Store, all that’s gone too. Well, mostly gone.</p>



<p>Thankfully, like our “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old PS Store</a>” workaround, there’s still a way to search PlayStation.com but it might also eventually go away. Google’s “search within a site” function has been around for nearly a decade at this point but I’m sure lots of people don’t even know it exists. For our purposes just head to <em>the Google</em>, type ‘site:playstation.com’ and then whatever game you’re looking for. You can use Google’s other search operators to refine the results as well. Put it all together and it looks something like this: <strong>site:playstation.com “age of booty”</strong></p>



<p>You’ll get search results across the playstation.com domain including PlayStation Blog posts and PlayStation Store pages but look for the ones that specifically state ‘www.playstation.com’. In the case of Age of Booty the page gives us a description and even some screenshots as well as a ‘Buy Download’ link. Of course, the download page has been hidden by Sony’s recent changes to their sites but the URL remains accessible so you can check other territories or check it out using the “<a href="https://delistedgames.com/get-the-old-playstation-store-back-for-now/">old</a>” method. Yes, <a href="https://delistedgames.com/age-of-booty/">Age of Booty</a> is still delisted on PlayStation 3.</p>



<p>Maybe it was just a feature that only <strong><em>I</em></strong> benefited from but it’s really sad to see Sony ostensibly kill 25 years of PlayStation content on the web. It makes the nostalgia trip of Astro’s Playroom feel a little more hollow.</p>

<p>This is a small story about tracking down a production bug in a Rust
application. I don’t know if there’s any take away from this one for the reader,
but it felt interesting so I’m sharing it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-backstory">A bit of backstory</h2>

<p>In Avast, we have a Rust application called <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It serves as a backend to
some other applications, provides them a HTTP API. It’s in Rust because it is
latency critical. Latencies of most requests are under a millisecond.</p>

<p>It was written with <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.*"><code>tokio-0.1</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.12.*"><code>hyper-0.12</code></a> to deal with the HTTP. We
were quite late to update to newer versions, in part because it worked fine and
the amount of <code>async</code> code was single quite short function, so we didn’t have
much motivation. And in part because we use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> libraries for
configuration. It’s a library to take configuration and set up the internal
state of the program for it ‒ configuration contains the ports to listen to,
etc, and it manages spawning the HTTP server objects inside the program and can
even migrate from one set of ports to other at runtime.</p>

<p>But migrating <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> to newer <code>tokio</code> and <code>hyper</code> was a big task (because
the API surface is quite large, the library does a bit unusual things compared
to all the usual applications and the change between old and new <code>tokio</code> was
quite large).</p>

<p>Anyway, eventually I got permission to work on the migration of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> as
part of my job. It took about a week to migrate both <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> and <a href="https://vorner.github.io/2019/05/19/rust-in-avast.html">urlite</a>. It
went through review, went through the automatic tests and we put it to the
staging environment for a while, watching the logs and graphs. Everything seemed
fine, so after few days of everything looking fine, we pushed the button and put
it to production.</p>

<h2 id="the-increased-latencies">The increased latencies</h2>

<p>As it goes in these kinds of stories, by now you’re expecting to see what went
wrong.</p>

<p>The thing is, our own metrics and graphs were fine. But the latency on the
downstream service querying us increased by 40ms. The deployment got reverted,
and we started to dig into where these latencies come from.</p>

<h2 id="it-was-acting-really-weird">It was acting really weird</h2>

<p>There were several very suspicious things about that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our own „internal“ latencies stayed the same. Our CPU usage also stayed the
same.</li>
  <li>The latency graph on the downstream side was flat 40ms <em>constant</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if we introduced some performance regression in the query handling, we
would expect our CPU consumption to rise. We would also expect the latency graph
to be a bit spiky, not completely flat 40ms constant. It almost looked like
there was a 40ms <code>sleep</code> somewhere. But why would anyone put a 40ms sleep
anywhere?</p>

<p>I’ve looked through documentation and didn’t see anything obvious. I’ve tried
searching both our code and code of the dependencies for <code>40</code>, asked on Slack if
that <code>40ms</code> value was familiar to anyone. Nothing.</p>

<p>The working theory we started with was that there could be some kind of back-off
sleep on some kind of failure. Maybe <code>hyper</code> would be closing inactive
connections in the new version, forcing the application to reconnect (the graph
was for 99th percentile, so if we happened to close each 100th connection and
reconnection took this long…) and maybe try IPv6 first and we would be listening
on IPv4 only or… (in other words, we didn’t have a clear clue).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmarks">The benchmarks</h2>

<p>My colleague started to investigate in a more thorough way than just throwing
ideas around on Slack. He run a <code>wrk</code> benchmark against the service. On his
machine, the latencies were fine. So he commandeered one of the stage nodes to
play with it and run the benchmark there. And every request had 40ms latency on
that machine. The previous version of <code>urlite</code> was fine, with under one
millisecond.</p>

<p><em>Something</em> was probably sleeping somewhere on the production servers, but not
on the development machine. There probably was some difference in the OS
settings, but definitely difference in the kernel version. The servers are
running some well-tried Linux distribution, so they have a lot older version,
while a developer is likely to run something much more on the edge.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-options">Configuration options</h2>

<p>The selling point of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spirit"><code>spirit</code></a> is that most of the thing one can set in the
builders of various libraries and types now can be just put into a config file
without any recompilation. If we did configuration by hand, we would expose only
the things we thought would be useful, but with spirit, there’s everything. So,
naturally, tweaking some of the config knobs was the next step (because it was
easy to do).</p>

<p>It was discovered that turning the <code>http1-writev</code> option <em>off</em>, which
corresponds to
<a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.8/hyper/server/struct.Builder.html#method.http1_writev">this method</a>
in <code>hyper</code>, made the latencies go away.</p>

<p>We now had a solution, but I wasn’t happy about not understanding <em>why</em> that
helped, so I went to dig the rabbit hole and find the root cause. Turns out
there were several little things in just the constellation to make the problem
manifest.</p>

<h2 id="overriding-the-defaults-of-http1_writev">Overriding the defaults of <code>http1_writev</code></h2>

<p>The method controls the strategy in which way data are pushed into the socket.
With vectored writes enabled, it sends two separate buffers (one with headers,
the other with the body if it’s small enough) through a single <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a>
syscall.  If they are disabled, <code>hyper</code> copies all the bytes into a single
buffer and sends that as a whole.</p>

<p>It turns out that the method takes a <code>bool</code>, but there are actually 3 states.
The third (auto) is signalled by <em>not</em> calling the method and <code>spirit-hyper</code> was
calling it always, with the default to turn the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/writev"><code>writev</code></a> on. I don’t know if
leaving it on auto would make the bug go away, but I’ve fixed the problem in the
library anyway.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-vectored-writes">Splitting vectored writes</h2>

<p>Spirit wants to support a bit of configuration on top of what the underlying
libraries provide on their own. One of such things is limiting the number of
concurrently accepted connections on a single listening socket. Users don’t have
to take advantage of that (the types for the configuration can be composed
together to either contain that bit or not and the administrator may leave the
values for the limits unset in the configuration and then they won’t be
enforced).</p>

<p>Anyway, in case the support for the limits is opted in through using the type
with the configuration fields, the connections themselves are wrapped in a
<a href="https://docs.rs/spirit-tokio/0.7.*/spirit_tokio/net/limits/struct.Tracked.html"><code>Tracked</code></a>
type. The type tries to be mostly transparent for use and can be used inside
<code>hyper</code> (which is what the default configuration type alias in <code>spirit-hyper</code>
does), but tracks how many connections there are, to not accept more if it runs
out of the limit.</p>

<p>When implementing the bunch of traits for the wrapper, I’ve overlooked the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.*/tokio/io/trait.AsyncWrite.html#method.poll_write_buf"><code>AsyncWrite::poll_write_buff</code></a>.
It is a provided method, which means it has a default implementation. It is the
one that abstracts the OS-level <code>writev</code>, it can write multiple buffers (the
<a href="https://docs.rs/bytes/0.5.*/bytes/buf/trait.Buf.html"><code>Buf</code></a> represents a
segmented buffer).</p>

<p>The default implementation simply delegates to multiple calls to the ordinary
write. Therefore, this omission combined with the default of enabling vectored
writes results in calling into the kernel twice, each time with a small buffer,
instead of once with two small buffers or once with a big buffer.</p>

<p>That was definitely something to get fixed, because if nothing else, syscalls
are expensive and calling more of them is not great. But I’ve finally felt like
I’m on the right path, because:</p>

<h2 id="nagles-algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</h2>

<p>You probably know that TCP stream is built from packets going there and back.
Optimizing how to split the stream into the packets and when to send them is a
hard problem and the research in that area is still ongoing, because there are
many conflicting requirements. One wants to deliver the data with low latency,
utilize the whole bandwidth, but not overflow the capacity of the link (in which
case the latencies would go up or packets would get lost and would have to be
retransmitted), leave some bandwidth to other connections, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm">Nagle’s algorithm</a> is
one of the older tricks up in TCP’s sleeve. The network doesn’t like small
packets.  It is better to send as large packets as the link allows, because each
packet has certain overhead ‒ the headers that take some space, but also routers
spend computation power mostly based on number of packets and less on their
size. If you start sending a lot of tiny packets, the performance will suffer.
While the links are limited by the number of bytes that can pass through them,
routers are more limited by the number of packets. If a router declares to be
able to handle a gigabit connection, it actually means a gigabit <em>if you use
full-sized packets</em>, but will get to few megabits if you split the data into
tiny packets.</p>

<p>So it would be better to wait until the send buffer contains a packetfull of
data before sending anything. But we can’t do that, because we don’t <em>know</em>
there’ll ever be a full packet of data, or generating more data might wait for
the other side to answer. We would never send anything and wait forever and the
Internet would not work.</p>

<p>Instead, the algorithm is willing to send <em>one</em> undersized packet and then it
waits for an <code>ACK</code> from the other side until sending another undersized one. If
it gets a packetfull of data to send in the meantime, that’s great and it sends
it (it won’t get better by waiting longer), but it won’t ever have two
undersized ones somewhere in flight, therefore won’t kill the network’s
performance by them.</p>

<p>This works, it’ll make progress eventually because once the <code>ACK</code> comes and
all the data that accumulated until then is sent.</p>

<p>But it also slows things down. Like in our case. What happens if we do it using
single syscall, the whole HTTP response forms a single undersized packet (we
have really small answers) and gets sent, no matter if it’s submitted to the
kernel by one big or two small buffers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we split the submission into two syscalls, this is what
happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We write the first part (headers). The kernel sends them out as an undersized
packet.</li>
  <li>We write the second part (the body). But the kernel shelves them into the send
buffer and waits for sending them until it sees the <code>ACK</code>, because there’s one
undersized packet …</li></ul></section></div></div>

              <p>Here’s the reality, billions of credentials have been leaked or stolen and are now easily downloaded online by anyone. Many of these databases of identities include passwords in plain text, while others are one-way hashed. One-way hashing is better (we’ll get to why in a second), but it is only as secure as is mathematically feasible. Let’s take a look at one-way hashing algorithms and how computers handle them.</p>

<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>

<p>A hash by definition is a function that can map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. SHA2 is a hashing algorithm that uses various bit-wise operations on any number of bytes to produce a fixed sized hash. For example, the SHA-256 algorithm produces a 256 bit result. The algorithm was designed specifically so that going from a hash back to the original bytes is infeasible. Developers use an SHA2 hash so that instead of storing a plain text password, they instead only store the hash. When a user is authenticated, the plain text password they type into the login form is hashed, and because the algorithm will always produce the same hash result given the same input, comparing this hash to the hash in the database tells us the password is correct.</p>

<h2 id="cracking-passwords">Cracking Passwords</h2>

<p>While one-way hashing means we aren’t storing plain text passwords, it is still possible to determine the original plain text password from a hash. Next, we’ll outline the two most common approaches of reversing a hash.</p>

<h3 id="lookup-tables">Lookup Tables</h3>

<p>The first is called a lookup table, or sometimes referred to as a rainbow table. This method builds a massive lookup table that maps hashes to plain text passwords. The table is built by simply hashing every possible password combination and storing it in some type of database or data-structure that allows for quick lookups.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a lookup table for SHA2 hashed passwords:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sha2_hash                                                          password</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a lookup table, all the attacker needs to know is the SHA2 hash of the password and they can see if it exists in the table. For example, let’s assume for a moment that Netflix stores your password using an SHA2 hash. If Netflix is breached, their user database is likely now available to anyone with a good internet connection and a torrent client. Even a mediocre hacker now only needs to lookup the SHA2 hash associated with your Netflix account to see if it exists in their lookup table. This will reveal nearly instantly what your plain text password is for Netflix. Now, this hacker can log in to your Netflix account and binge watch all four seasons of Fuller House (“how rude!”). And he can also try this password on Hulu and HBO Go to see if you used the same email address and password for those accounts as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/salt.png" alt="Salt"></p>

<p>The best way to protect against this type of attack is to use what is called a <strong>salt</strong>. A salt is simply a bunch of random characters that you prepend to the password before it is hashed. Each password should have a different salt, which means that a lookup table is unlikely to have an entry for the combination of the salt and the password. This makes salts an ideal defense against lookup tables.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a salt and the resulting combination of the password and the salt which is then hashed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Bad, no salt. Very bland.</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>"password"</span><span>)</span> <span>// 6b3a55e0261b0304143f805a24924d0c1c44524821305f31d9277843b8a10f4e</span>

<span>// Better, add a salt.</span>
<span>salt</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3a"</span>
<span>toHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>";L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword"</span>
<span>sha2</span><span>(</span><span>toHash</span><span>)</span> <span>// f534e6bf84a638112e07e69861927ab624c0217c0655e4d3be07659bcf6c1c07</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have added the salt, the “password” that we actually generated the hash from was the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>. This String is long, complex and contains a lot of random characters. Therefore, it is nearly impossible that the hacker that created the lookup table would have generated the hash for the String <code>;L'-2!;+=#/5B)40/o-okOw8//3apassword</code>.</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/hulk.png" alt="Brute Force"></p>

<p>The second method that attackers use to crack passwords is called brute force cracking. This means that the attacker writes a computer program that can generate all possible combinations of characters that can be used for a password and then computes the hash for each combination. This program can also take a salt if the password was hashed with a salt. The attacker then runs the program until it generates a hash that is the same as the hash from the database. Here’s a simple Java program for cracking passwords. We left out some detail to keep the code short (such as all the possible password characters), but you get the idea.</p>

<p>This program will generate all the possible passwords with lengths between 6 and 8 characters and then hash each one until it finds a match. This type of brute-force hacking takes time because of the number of possible combinations.</p>

<h2 id="password-complexity-vs-computational-power">Password complexity vs. computational power</h2>

<p>Let’s bust out our TI-85 calculators and see if we can figure out how long this program will take to run. For this example we will assume the passwords can only contain ASCII characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation). This set is roughly 100 characters (this is rounded up to make the math easier to read). If we know that there are at least 6 characters and at most 8 characters in a password, then all the possible combinations can be represented by this expression:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result of this expression is equal to <code>10,101,000,000,000,000</code>. This is quite a large number, North of 10 quadrillion to be a little more precise, but what does it actually mean when it comes to our cracking program? This depends on the speed of the computer the cracking program is running on and how long it takes the computer to execute the SHA2 algorithm. The algorithm is the key component here because the rest of the program is extremely fast at creating the passwords.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get dicey. If you run a quick Google search for <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fastest+bitcoin+rig">“fastest bitcoin rig”</a> you’ll see that these machines are rated in terms of the number of hashes they can perform per second. The bigger ones can be rated as high as <code>44 TH/s</code>. That means it can generate 44 tera-hashes per second or <code>44,000,000,000,000</code>.</p>

<p>Now, if we divide the total number of passwords by the number of hashes we can generate per second, we are left with the total time it takes a Bitcoin rig to generate the hashes for all possible passwords. In our example above, this equates to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.0101e16

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = ~230
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that using this example Bitcoin rig, we could generate all the hashes for a password between 6 and 8 characters in length in roughly 4 minutes. Feeling nervous yet? Let’s add one additional character and see long it takes to hash all possible passwords between 6 and 9 characters.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^9 + 100^8 + 100^7 + 100^6 = 1.010101E18

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 22,956
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = ~383
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = ~6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By adding one additional character to the potential length of the password we increased the total compute time from 4 minutes to 6 hours. This is nearing a 100x increase in computational time to use the brute force strategy. You probably can see where this is going. To defeat the brute force strategy, you simply need to make it improbable to calculate all possible password combinations.</p>

<p>Let’s get crazy and make a jump to 16 characters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoinRig = 4.4e13
possiblePasswords = 100^16 + 100^15 ... 100^7 + 100^6 = 1e32

numberOfSeconds = possiblePasswords / bitcoinRig = 2.27e18
numberOfMinutes = numberOfSeconds / 60 = 3.78e16
numberOfHours = numberOfMinutes / 60 = 630,000,000,000,000 or 630 trillion
numberOfDays = numberOfHours / 24 = 26,250,000,000,000 or 26.25 trillion days
numberOfYears = numberOfDays / 365 = 71,917,808,219 or 71.9 billion years
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To boil down our results, if we take these expressions and simplify them, we can build an equation that solves for any length password.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>numberOfSeconds = 100^lengthOfPassword / computeSpeed
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This equation shows that as the password length increases, …</p></div></div>

As it tends to do, time continues to move on.  The project and code in
it eventually becomes legacy code (aka, someone else's problem to
maintain).
</p>

<p>
One day, the business drudges up that old automated cookie creation
idea and requests that it handles a new task - "instead of just cooking
peanut butter cookies, it'd be great if the cookie system could handle
oatmeal raisin as well!".
</p>

<p>
Hah!  You remember that old system, but you're onto newer and better
things.  This is a perfect task for the intern to sink their teeth
into - afterall, it's legacy and not high profile, it's been stable,
and it was so simple to implement the first time around.
</p>

<p>
The new set of requirements/recipe the intern works off of looks very
similar to the initial ones:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Preheat oven to 325F, grease cookie sheet</li>
<li>Step 2: In bowl, stir oats, pumpkin puree and sugar until smooth.</li>
<li>Step 3: Beat in one egg white, then stir in baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Step 4: Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 inches apart on the sheet.</li>
<li>Step 5: Bake for 8 minutes, cool for 5, enjoy!</li>
</ul>

The code comes in, the peer reviews pass it as it meets the
requirements and nothing is obviously wrong.  Still, it has become a
bit harder to understand and you're left with a nagging feeling.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>When I was growing up using computers I was clueless about character sets. Mostly there were just US characters, and everyone converted the umlauts (Ä and Ö) and the A with the overring (Å) used in Finnish to their A, O and A equivalents. I guess you could call that transliteration, and we all did it&nbsp;because we had to. Technology evolved and we got more and more Äs, Ös and Ås in our digital lives. Everyone I knew was using Windows. Life was good. Then came the web and trouble started brewing.</p><div><p>I started my webmaster amateur career sometime in 1996. I still didn't know (or care) much about character sets, and the most common mistakes I made while learning was with images;&nbsp;I accidentally referred to them from my local C: drive or they were so large it would take a fortnight to load with my somewhat outdated 9.6k <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Valley_Products" title="">GVC</a> modem.</p><p>It wasn't until my first "real job" in early 2000 when I got a glimpse of&nbsp;the horrors of character sets. At work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_director" title="">Art Directors</a>&nbsp;were using colorful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_G3" title="">Macintosh G3 tower computers</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9" title="">Mac OS 9</a> that didn't seem to run straight for more than a day. Even worse, sometimes they couldn't even display contemporary words like <a href="https://urbaanisanakirja.com/word/larvilautanen/" title="">lärvilautanen</a> or names like <a href="https://www.mikrobitti.fi/uutiset/jaakko-rytsola-oli-lamborghininsa-kanssa-it-kuplan-kasvot-menetti-miljoonat-ja-haluaa-nyt-opettaa-rahan-arvon-uudella-sovelluksella/dc23a929-db4d-4302-ab7d-3b5a8127d0ff" title="">Rytsölä</a> right. I&nbsp;snickered and crouched over the keyboard of my rock-solid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT" title="">Windows NT</a> workstation to&nbsp;craft some fine artesan HTML with notepad.exe.</p><p>The early 2000s were an intense learning experience for me. I switched over from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad" title="">Microsoft Notepad</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@velmu/is-it-time-to-reconsider-dreamweaver-34d442e5c278" title="">Macromedia DreamWeaver</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_HomeSite" title="">Allaire HomeSite</a>. My career peaked when I worked on&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001019003024/http://www.bomfunk.net/main_first.html" title="">the homepage for Bomfunk MCs</a>.&nbsp;I felt invincible. I ran into trouble with characters occasionally, but the "real developers" working with ASP or Java were always willing to help the front end developer greenhorn&nbsp;navigate the seas of broken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana" title="">Verdana</a> on a manager's&nbsp;screen. Every so often I also had issues with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" title="">line breaks</a> too, but the bearded guy always helped me out. I think he used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)" title="">Solaris</a>.</p><p>I didn't really start my hate-hate relationship with characters until around 2003. At twenty-three I was now a <em>Senior Developer</em>, and had stretched my wings to the server-side as well with mad LAMP&nbsp;skillz and setting up vhosts on Apache. I was, what you would now call&nbsp;a <em>Senior Fullstack Ninja</em>. Or that's how I saw myself. I was&nbsp;the person people came to get advice from, knee-deep in JavaScript, having innovated an <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/pdf/tarvainen_thesis-040428.pdf" title="">amazing client-side bug tracker</a>&nbsp;that would change how we work. Little did I know.</p><p>At this point I was also working on some projects for a well-known (at the time) Finnish mobile phone manufacturer in foreign languages like Hebrew&nbsp;and Hungarian. This is when it all started falling apart. In the past I had been able to solve issues with weird characters by poking them with a stick or the magical&nbsp;<em>charset=iso-8859-1</em>&nbsp;metatag. But things were gradually getting worse. I was increasingly unable to use HomeSite because the characters were garbled. After too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYv4yadRexY" title="">Jallu</a> shots, I&nbsp;opened up to a guru about this and he mumbled something about no support for UTF-8.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I was a man on a mission. I would find out all about this UTF-8 and conquer this land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language" title="">SGML</a>-like markup once again. I armed myself with all the information on the interwebs and even bought a hard copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unicode-explained/059610121X/" title="">O'Reilly mini reference on UTF-8</a>. Then I kind of got it, but things were complicated in the real world. Some things were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" title="">UTF-8</a>, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1" title="">ISO-8859-1</a> and occasionally there was some random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Latin_encoding" title="">Macintosh Latin</a> from a unicorn who could do design and HTML. I read deeper and started seeing nightmares about monsters like the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" title="">Byte Order Mark</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" title="">Endianness</a>. Cumulatively I spent weeks on&nbsp;figuring out character sets from files&nbsp;and parsing out something not fÃ©d.</p><p>I was still quite confused&nbsp;with the prospect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16" title="">UTF-16</a> and what it would mean for me. Gladly that seemed to have been a whole lot of nothing, and with a steady&nbsp;diet of Linux, OS X and Windows on the desktop it seemed the worst was over. There were some cases where I needed to figure out strange issues with broken characters (usually because of using <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/shit/PHP-the-good-parts.png" title="">non-multibyte safe functions</a> on the server), but this was much more of my own fault than random wonky encodings from input data.</p><p>Still, there were some systems not using UTF-8 by default.&nbsp;There was little incentive for that as it wasn't like there were new letters being added to the English alphabet&nbsp;or anything. This changed gradually with the mainstream adoption of smartphones and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji" title="">Emojis</a>. Those cute little&nbsp;🖼️s are essentially new letters to the alphabet. To stay relevant in the age of social media you had to support emoji&nbsp;or you were&nbsp;💀 in the 💧. Fast forward to today and I can't remember the time I wrestled broken characters.</p><p>There are still enterprise&nbsp;systems that can suffer a death by a thousand candy-bar emojis&nbsp;and <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-unicode-utf8mb4.html" title="">UTF-8 quirks in MySQL</a>, but overall I am now in a much happier&nbsp;place. I still don't really know how all this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)" title="">character set black magic</a>&nbsp;works deep down, but I don't need to know. For most part it's now a non-issue in my life. And it's amusing to see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-apple-ios-11-1-new-emojis-security-updates.html" title="">Apple using new emojis as a carrot</a> to get people to install the latest security patches. This was a fun nostalgia trip, but I certainly wouldn't want to go back in time to work on multilingual web development. Or implement designs with rounded corners.</p><p>I'd like to extend a&nbsp;big thank you to everyone for using emoji! You saved my&nbsp;🍑!</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christiannkoepke?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Christiann Koepke</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/peaches-tree?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>"Is C good as first language?" "Is&nbsp;there still future with C?"
"Why should I even bother with C?" "C is old!" …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you heard such words? Well, I have. Countless of times, be it
in direct conversation or on a forum. The response is, as always, "it depends",
but in my humble opinion learning C is really valuable experience.</p>

<p>In this not too long text I hope to show you what I think makes C great.</p>

<h3 id="spirit-of-c">Spirit of C</h3>

<p>Let's start with a quote from document <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf">C99RationaleV5.10</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The C89 Committee kept as a major goal to preserve the traditional spiritof C.
There are many facets of the spirit of C, but the essence is a community
sentiment of the underlying principles upon which the C language is based.
Some of the facets of the spirit of C can be summarized in phrases like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Trust the programmer.</em></li>
    <li><em>Don’t prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done.</em></li>
    <li><em>Keep the language small and simple.</em></li>
    <li><em>Provide only one way to do an operation.</em></li>
    <li><em>Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Above points directly relate to what I will talk further in the article.</p>

<h3 id="mid-level">"Mid-level"</h3>

<p>In regards of level, there are two types of languages: low and high.</p>

<p>Low-level languages are close to the hardware, the only closer thing to CPU
would be electricity itself. Those languages are divided into machine code and
Assembly. The former is a stream of raw, usually binary, data. If somebody is
required to work with it, usually does it using more "readable" hexadecimal form.</p>

<p>Second-generation languages - Assembly - provide one abstraction level on top
of the machine code. Those languages are mostly only a mapping of human-readable
symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants,
strings and so on. Also are different for each processor.</p>

<p>How do high-level languages, providing more abstraction, compare? Quoting Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language
elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of
developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a
lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how
"high-level" a programming language is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: low = more machine friendly, high = more human friendly.</p>

<p>C is high-level, but back when it was created, most of the work was still being
done in low-level Assembly. As a result, C has lower level of abstraction than
other (still) widely used languages, hence I like to call it "mid-level".</p>

<p>You can also easily (with less language bloat) compile C code to Assembly
instead to binary and examine what instructions CPU will execute.</p>

<p>And if it there is a need, popular C compilers offers you the option in C level
down and use inline Assembly to squeeze everything out of CPU. Not really many
other languages implement such a thing.</p>

<h3 id="fairly-simple">Fairly simple</h3>

<p>Low-level languages are harder to program in. Not because they are more complicated,
but because they are more error prone and thus require way more commitment,
memorizing and fiddling.</p>

<p>C is mid-level, so "by definition" it's easier. But there comes the surprise,
learning it is easier compared to higher level languages. Why? Because of really
simple syntax and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">structured paradigm</a>
(don't confuse with <code>struct</code>!). It doesn't take so much to learn the basics.
Loops, functions, structures, pointers, variables, types - the core of language.
Intense week to get the general idea. The rest is "just" maths and CS theorem.</p>

<p>But, but, but, but! Don't get me wrong! To master anything you will
need a lot more practice! <strong>A lot!</strong> And it's truth for anything out there!</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-lightweight">Fast and lightweight</h3>

<p>Standard C library is small compared to other languages (e.g Java). It's small
enough for you to try to memorize all functions successfully (not that it would
be a huge benefit). Yeah, many things should be deprecated long ago, there
obviously is some bloat (try to maintains something without bloat for few years,
let alone few decades), but there is not much enough of it to hinder the performance.</p>

<p>And what if libc is still too much? Nothing stands in the way of not using it
at all. Just don't include any of its headers - not even simple <code>printf()</code> will
be present. Replace it with any other library of your choice.</p>

<p>Maturity, emphasis on proper memory management, inline Assembly, small abstraction
and little bloat gives programmer really good control over the program.</p>

<p>This makes C an ideal choice for OS kernels (Linux, Windows NT or macOS's XNU to
name a few) or other languages (e.g. Python). That's also why C is so popular
on embedded systems, where you cannot afford to waste resources.</p>

<h3 id="ubiquity--portability">Ubiquity = portability</h3>

<p>Does there exist any (still) significant platform with no C compiler available?
Except for those which run only Assembly, I've never heard about one.
C programs are present on your high-end gaming PC, on NASA spacecrafts and
in ticket machines. Literally everywhere. C software runs the world.</p>

<p>In accordance to previous paragraphs, C is peculiarly strong choice for
microcontrollers and other forms of embedded systems, which surround us every day.</p>

<p>And have you heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">FFI</a>?
Turns out many other languages like to have some kind of compatibility with C.</p>

<p>You don't need to worry if you will be able to use this language somewhere as
for 99% you can! (Although it doesn't mean you should…) It means, that while
code may not be 100% portable, you will be a portable programmer.</p>

<h3 id="the-influencer">The influencer</h3>

<p>C has both directly and indirectly influenced innumerous amount of languages.
C++, Java, Go, D, Rust, Perl, even PHP and Python - those are but few examples.</p>

<p>Obviously, knowledge of C isn't needed to learn any of them and sometimes
may even push you to use not the best practices.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think it's important to remember the roots. And if you are
cautious, familiarity with C might give you some foothold. It's especially the
case with C++.</p>

<h3 id="rich-collection-of-libraries">Rich collection of libraries</h3>

<p>I suspect all this talk about fastness, lightness, mid-level, Assembly etc. might
have give you an idea, you will need to implement everything yourself. There may
be not any <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a>
like in Java or other or other functionality like garbage collector…
True, true, except…  not entirely.</p>

<p>C is mature and popular language. Name a thing and believe me, somebody somewhere
already created library for it (although if think about something too obscure,
you won't find it for all the world, but it does exists).</p>

<p>You want garbage collector? <a href="https://www.hboehm.info/gc/">Boehm GC</a> has you covered.
TUI? Nothing like timeless <a href="https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/">ncurses</a>.
Examples can be listed almost infinitely:
<a href="https://gtk.org/">GTK</a>,
<a href="https://pdcurses.org/">PDCurses</a>,

<a href="https://mupdf.com/">MuPDF</a>,
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>…</p>

<p>It's very universal language - you can program basically anything: web server,
video game (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/id-Software">classics from <em>id Software</em></a>),
operating system, other programming language or wrapper forcing Firefox to obey
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory">XDG Base Directory specification</a>,
because when I'm an administrator, the programs will do exacly what I told them to!</p>

<p>However, please, remember - the fact you can, doesn't mean you should. For example,
if you want to create a video game, you really ought to turn your eyes to C++.
And you should know, that…</p>

<h3 id="c-is-highly-backward-compatible">C++ is highly backward compatible</h3>

<p>Why do I even make the whole point out of C++ here? Because it's one of most
widely used languages today and you encountering it is more than certain.</p>

<p>In contrary to other languages embracing C compatibility, C++ was created as its
direct descendant and committee goes to great lengths to keep the "copy-paste"
compatibility with it - in most cases you can compile C code as C++ just fine.</p>

<p>Don't be mistaken, C++ isn't by any means a superset of C - the code isn't always
going to work with C++ and a good C code isn't necessary good C++ code. Consider example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>10</span> <span>*</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>x</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Proper way in C, but in C++ there ought to be <code>(int*)</code> before <code>malloc()</code>,
for it to work, not to mention you should use <code>new int[10]</code> instead.</p>

<p>Although in most cases you can use C library safely in your C++ project.</p>

<p>All examples from the previous point not only <strong>can be</strong>, but <strong>often are</strong>
used in such way. E.g. I myself used <em>ncurses</em> in my C++ code for hex editor
<a href="https://joren.ga/bym/">Bym</a>.</p>

<p>Even libraries already compiled with C compiler can be made compatible with C++,
thanks to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage"><code>extern "C"</code></a>
linkage specifier.</p>

<h3 id="a-blot-on-the-landscape">A blot on the landscape…</h3>

<p>C was created in year 1972 on the foundation of B language, so over the years
it acquired some quirks (<code>memcpy()</code> is defined in string header!), some things
became obsolete, some useless and are kept only for compatibility with old code.</p>

<p>A beginner is likely to burn a lot of time chasing down strange behavior caused
by memory corruption with no idea how to reason about, what may lead actually
big discouraged to programming in general. There is little to none mechanism
to prevent programmer from shooting themselves in the foot.</p>

<p>It's also important to take into account that C is not the introduction to
Computer Science. Learning none of languages is. You need to study it properly
to get a true understanding of this vast field. If not formal education in
university, then online one will be good too. The Internet is full of resources,
some can be found on my <a href="https://joren.ga/urlsList/">list of URLs</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Learning C is valuable experience and it's worth it. If not as your first
language, then as second, third, fourth or whatever. There are a lot of advantages,
but also some disadvantages. At least trying won't hurt. Give it a chance, who
knows, you may truly get to like it, just like me.</p>

<p>And don't believe people saying "C is dead" or "It will soon be replaced"
(I'm looking at you Rust fans). C is fine and will be relevant for few next decades too.
Heck! COBOL, nearly forgotten, yet there are still job openings! How is C supposed
to become obscure when, in the moment I write those words, there is planned new
standard …</p></div></div>

<p>Performance is important for many Rust programs. </p>
<p>This book contains many techniques that can improve the performance—speed and
memory usage—of Rust programs. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/compile-times.html">Compile Times</a> section also contains some
techniques that will improve the compile times of Rust programs. Some of the
book’s techniques only require changing build configurations, but many require
changing code.</p>
<p>Some of the techniques within are entirely Rust-specific, and some involve
ideas that can be applied (often with modifications) to programs written in
other languages. The <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/general-tips.html">General Tips</a> section also includes some general
principles that apply to any programming language. Nonetheless, this book is
mostly about the performance of Rust programs and is no substitute for a
general purpose guide to profiling and optimization.</p>
<p>The book also focuses on techniques that are practical and proven: many are
accompanied by links to pull requests or other resources that show how the
technique was used on a real-world Rust program.</p>
<p>This book is aimed at intermediate and advanced Rust users. Beginner Rust users
have more than enough to learn and these techniques are likely to be an
unhelpful distraction to them.</p>

November 17, 2020 | https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://steampunk.si/blog/getting-started-with-ansible/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>In our <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to tonfiguration management tools post">previous blog post</a>, we looked at what configuration management
tools bring to the table. And in this post, we will take a closer look at
Ansible, our configuration management tool of choice. So if you want to learn
what Ansible is, what it does, and how it works, this is the post for you.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" title="Ansible's home page">Ansible</a> and some of the benefits we gain when
using it. Next, we will describe the differences between three different
Ansible packages and give some advice on picking the right one for our use
case. We will continue with the installation instructions and finally wrap up
with an interactive walkthrough of Ansible’s basic functionality like running
Ansible playbooks and installing extra Ansible content.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ansible">What is Ansible</h2>
<p>We all probably heard about automation systems that suffer from <em>managing the
management</em> and <em>automating your automation</em> issues. Ansible not only brings
order to our infrastructure, but it also does it sustainably.</p>
<p>Because Ansible is <strong>agentless</strong>, dealing with daemons being down,
upgrading agents, and patching agent security vulnerabilities are a thing of
the past.  All we need to do is keep our control node (the computer where the
Ansible runs) updated, and we should be safe.</p>
<p>But what does Ansible do exactly? <strong>Ansible’s primary responsibility is to
reliably enforce the desired state on a set of targets.</strong></p>
<p>We usually keep the state description in a relatively human-friendly and
machine-executable file called an Ansible playbook. We have a bit more
flexibility when it comes to storing information about targets. We can use:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Static inventory files</strong> that contain login information for our targets.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory plugins</strong> that fetch connection information from some
canonical sources like IaaS API.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enforcing the desired state</strong> in the Ansible world can mean almost anything:
writing a configuration file, creating a virtual machine in the cloud, adding
a VLAN to a network switch, etc. All we need is an Ansible module for
performing the task at hand. And there are a lot of them available out there.
We will talk more about how to obtain them in the last part of this post.</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong> (or <strong>host</strong>) is also quite a broad term in the Ansible world.
Historically, the primary target type was a virtual machine that Ansible
managed via the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. But today, Ansible can control
many other things like containers, networking equipment, and various
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms. And because Ansible is
agentless, getting it to work with a specific piece of software or hardware is
usually much easier compared to other configuration management tools.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to start talking about Ansible versions.</p>
<h2 id="what-ansible-package-to-use">What Ansible package to use</h2>
<p>Today, there are three Ansible packages that we can use for our day-to-day
automatization tasks: <code>ansible-2.9</code>, <code>ansible-2.10</code>, and <code>ansible-base-2.10</code>.
Why? Because the monolithic Ansible package was split into a core engine and a
few bundles of Ansible content called Ansible Collections for the 2.10
release.</p>
<p>But fortunately for us, selecting the correct package is relatively simple.
Just answer the following questions in order and stop when you answer “yes”
for the first time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you a Red Hat subscriber or want to purchase support? Use
<strong>ansible-2.9</strong>.</li>
<li>Do you have existing playbooks and no time to learn about Ansible
Collections? Use <strong>ansible-2.10</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>ansible-base-2.10</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We made sure examples from this blog post work with all of the versions
mentioned above, so you should have no trouble following along.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-install-ansible">How to install Ansible</h2>
<p>We only need to install Ansible onto the control node (the computer or virtual
machine you will run Ansible commands on). The most flexible way of installing
Ansible is using <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install --user "ansible==2.9.*"  # For ansible 2.9
$ pip install --user ansible           # For ansible 2.10 and newer
$ pip install --user ansible-base      # For ansible-base
</code></pre>
<p>This will install Ansible only for our user account and not mess up the system
if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>We can also install Ansible using our distribution’s package manager (for
example, <code>dnf</code> on RHEL 8 or <code>apt</code> on Debian-derived distributions).</p>
<pre><code>$ yum install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 7
$ dnf install ansible  # RHEL and CentOS 8
$ apt install ansible  # Debian and Ubuntu
</code></pre>
<p>But bear in mind that most distributions do not package <code>ansible-base</code> and
<code>ansible</code> 2.10 yet, so you might need to resort to the <code>pip</code> method for the
time being. Official <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html" title="Official installation instructions">installation instructions</a> contain even more
installation-related details.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot use a Windows machine as an Ansible control node.
Matt Davis, one of the core Ansible developers, wrote a
<a href="http://blog.rolpdog.com/2020/03/why-no-ansible-controller-for-windows.html" title="Why no Ansible controller for Windows?">blog post</a> about the reasons. Matt also gives some hints about
what Windows users can do to remedy the situation, so make sure you check his
post out.</p>
<p>Once the installation is behind us, we should be able to run the following
command without errors:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.14
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.6 (default, Sep 25 2020, 00:00:00) [GCC 10.2.1 20200723]
</code></pre>
<p>If nothing went awry, we are ready to start playing with Ansible.</p>
<h2 id="taking-ansible-for-a-spin">Taking Ansible for a spin</h2>
<p>In this last section, we will play around a bit with Ansible. We will start by
analyzing a small Ansible playbook and explaining the purpose of its
components, continue with discussing the Ansible inventory, and conclude
our escapade with some custom Ansible content installation.</p>
<p>If you would like to follow along with us, you will need a Linux computer with
Ansible and Docker installed.</p>
<h3 id="ansible-playbook">Ansible playbook</h3>
<p>Let us start with something relatively simple:</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        dest: /tmp/my.cfg
        content: Hello, World!
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you never heard about Ansible playbook or YAML before, you probably
guessed that we want to create the <code>/tmp/my.cfg</code> file with the <code>Hello, World!</code>
inside it on our local computer. Let us test this. When we run the
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command (we assumed that the playbook is stored in the
<code>play.yaml</code> file), we will see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
changed: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>And sure enough, if we open the <code>/tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> file, the hello is there ;)
But how did Ansible know what to do? Explanation time ;)</p>
<p>Ansible playbook is nothing more than a list of plays that Ansible executes
one after another. For the sake of simplicity, our example contains a single
Configure local computer play. The <code>hosts: localhost</code> line informed Ansible
that we will be messing with our local computer. This is the target that we
talked about previously.</p>
<p>All real action happened in the <code>tasks</code> section of the play. The
<code>ansible.builtin.copy:</code> line told Ansible that we want to use the built-in
copy module to create a file. And the <code>dest: /tmp/my-cfg.txt</code> and <code>content: Hello</code> parameter lines provided information to the copy module about our
file’s location and what to place inside it, respectively. The line that
starts with <code>- name</code> serves as documentation for us and is printed to the
output when Ansible starts executing the task at hand.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, Ansible did not create a file. It would be more accurate
to say that Ansible made sure our text file exists and has the correct
content. We can see this technical nitpick in action if we run the same
<code>ansible-playbook</code> command again:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook play.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
  that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'

PLAY [Configure local computer] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create config file] ************************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************
localhost              : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how in the previous run, Ansible reported our file creation task as
changed, and in this last run, the output changed to ok. This happened because
Ansible determined that the file’s current and desired state are precisely the
same, and there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>But our configuration files are rarely entirely static, meaning that we often
need to customize their content based on some external information. And this
is where variables and <code>ansible.builtin.template</code> module come into play - pun
intended ;).</p>
<p>Using variables in templates is reasonably straightforward: we just need to
place the variable name inside double curly braces, and the template module
will replace it with the variable’s value. For example, this is how our
parameterized configuration file could look:</p>
<pre><code>{{ greeting }} from {{ ansible_distribution }}, World!
</code></pre>
<p>But before we can use the variable, we need to define it somewhere. There are
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html" title="Official Ansible documentation in variables">many places</a> where Ansible will look for variable definitions, but we
will keep it simple and provide them as part of the playbook (the <code>vars</code>
section in the listing below).</p>
<pre><code>---
- name: Configure local computer
  hosts: localhost

  vars:
    greeting: Welcome

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      …</code></pre></div></div>

        <p><figcaption>S. Yuvarajaa</figcaption></p></figure><div><p><em>Editor’s note: IRCTC’s response on Twitter has been added to the story.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Kozhikode, KERALA — On the afternoon of October 23, S. Yuvarajaa was at his home in Tirupur, writing software, when the Railway Police Force came knocking on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“Did you develop this app?” the policemen asked, pointing to a phone screen displaying Super Tatkal, a phone app developed by Yuvarajaa that books tatkal rail tickets much faster than Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/irctc/">IRCTC</a>), the Indian Railways’ famously cumbersome website.</p><p>When he said ‘yes’, Yuvarajaa, a 32-year-old alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur, was arrested under the Indian Railways Act 1989 for the “unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets”.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/lsr-student-suicide-lockdown-poverty-hostel-policy_in_5fa8ab81c5b6f21920dd705e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lockdown Poverty And Hostel Policy Push LSR Scholarship Student To Suicide</a></strong></em></p><p>Soon after his arrest, the railway authorities deactivated Super Tatkal and Super Tatkal Pro, which were available on Google Playstore until then. Yuvarajaa spent about a week in jail.</p><p>Now out on bail and faced with mounting legal fees, Yuvarajaa says he just wants the railways to understand that far from “swindling” users — as the railways have alleged — he just wanted to help rail passengers book their tickets with ease.</p><p>“I want them to talk to me and find out how the apps can help IRCTC’s ticket-booking operations. I might have been naïve and unaware of consequences when I developed the apps but I had the best of intentions,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “I have a solution that can effectively address the current issues on the IRCTC website<strong>.</strong> I would like to help them make their website better so that end users, the passengers, can book tickets easily.”</p><p>For now, Yuvarajaa and Super Tatkal have become unfortunate case studies of what happens when the software industry’s ethos of digital disruption crashes into India’s famously prickly bureaucracy as epitomised by the 167-year-old Indian Railways.&nbsp;</p><p>A young coder from a small town who gave up a comfortable job in an aeronautics firm to set up his own business, Yuvarajaa is a poster child for the Indian government’s mission to support digital entrepreneurs of the sort that Prime Minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/narendra-modi/">Narendra Modi</a> exhorts to “take risks” and embark on adventures.</p><p>Yet, as Yuvarajaa’s arrest shows, the biggest impediment to innovation are his government’s many departments. Yuvarajaa saw himself as an entrepreneur’ but the Railways press release announcing his arrest described him as a “tout”.</p><p>&nbsp;“Regulatory frameworks, be that of IRCTC or that of any other government institution, should not be bypassed,” said S. Arunachalam, Academic Director of Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Indian School of Business. “But I think that he should have been warned first to reach an amicable solution.”&nbsp;</p><p>IRCTC responded to <em>HuffPost India</em> on Twitter, saying that the use of “illegal software” is prohibited under the Railways Act.</p></div><div><blockquote data-dnt="true" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The software developed was used illegally to book tkts through the tickets denying genuine users.Use of illegal software is prohibited under Rly act. No faster app as these features were  available with IRCTC which were disabled to ensure level playing field .</p>— IRCTC (@IRCTCofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/IRCTCofficial/status/1328668272032583683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote></div><div><h3><strong>From Tirupur to Super Tatkal</strong></h3><p>The story of Super Tatkal has its roots in Yuvarajaa’s journey from a small town in Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru, India’s self-described Silicon Valley.</p><p>Yuvarajaa comes from a family of farmers—&nbsp;his father worked as one until he died in 2008 and his mother, Eswari, still cultivates the family’s 30 acres of land.</p><p>Yuvarajaa recalls that he first started programming in BASIC as an 11-year-old. Soon, he developed a love for coding and started considering engineering as a career option when he was introduced to Java in Class XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2007, Yuvarajaa signed up for an aeronautical engineering degree at the Madras Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu’s premier tech school. Since he had topped Class XII in his district, he had a three-year scholarship of Rs 3,000 per month from the Indian government’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p><p>At MIT-Chennai, Yuvarajaa met others like him who loved coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We were a group of people who liked programming. When some of us went on to take up jobs, Yuvarajaa went for higher studies as he was passionate about engineering,” said Akilan, a friend and fellow aeronautical engineer who is currently working in New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>After graduating in 2010 from MIT Chennai, Yuvarajaa joined IIT-Kharagpur for an M. Tech in aeronautical engineering. Again, he had a scholarship, this time for topping the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering).&nbsp;</p><p>Once he finished his IIT course, he joined a firm in Bengaluru.&nbsp;</p><p>“In aeronautical engineering there are very few private firms which offer jobs. But he got one of the good jobs available in India,” Akilan said.&nbsp;</p><p>While working in Bengaluru, Yuvarajaa frequently booked tickets to travel home to Tirupur.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was then that I realised that the IRCTC app is terribly slow. Besides, I always wanted to develop apps and this felt like the right time,” Yuvarajaa told <em>HuffPost India</em>. “So Super Tatkal took shape.”</p><p>Super Tatkal, launched in 2016, allowed users to prefill their journey details and paste these onto the IRCTC website. This sped up the booking process by about five times the usual time it takes to book tickets on IRCTC website, said Yuvarajaa.&nbsp;</p><p>The app was buggy at first, he said, but a steady group of users kept sharing their experience.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went about correcting the bugs and realised that the app was gaining traction,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Super Tatkal was free for the first year. Later, as the maintenance cost of servers increased to Rs 10,000 per month, Yuvarajaa asked for user contributions — but this didn’t help much. He then decided to finance the app through in-app purchases where users were asked to buy a stack of 10 virtual coins for Rs 20. After the first three free bookings, the app charged five coins per transaction —&nbsp;ie, a nominal fee of Rs 10 per booking.</p><p>The Railway Police claims Yuvarajaa earned Rs 20 lakh through Super Tatkal between 2016 and 2020. This may sound like a big number, but it works out to about Rs 40,000 per month.</p><p>Yuvarajaa said all his users were aware of the payment model and that he had not cheated anyone into paying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><figure>
        <p><figcaption>A screengrab of the Super Tatkal Pro app before it was deactivated.</figcaption></p></figure><div><h3><strong>‘Didn’t take permission’</strong></h3><p>While Super Tatkal was taking off, Yuvarajaa soon became comfortable in the startup bubble. He quit his job in 2017 and started a truck aggregator app, Speedbird trucks, along with two of his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was like an Ola or Uber for trucks. It took off well in the beginning,” Yuvarajaa said. But before the app could get traction, trouble started. It was difficult to convince people to use the trucks available on the app because existing contracts from known services seemed simpler for users.&nbsp;</p><p>“We took on lease two trucks to run the app but that ended in losses,” said Yuvarajaa. The company was built on the life savings of the three young men and it lacked a business model.&nbsp;</p><p>“To arrive at the business model one has to experiment with various models and this costs money,” said Yuvarajaa. The company also lacked a mentor, an industry insider, who could have offered steady advice and feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is difficult to network and find help when you are a beginner,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn’t have an investor. “We were at the experimental stage and could not win the confidence of an investor,” he said. In the experimental stage, startups built on little resources are mostly on their own and can only dream of reaching the patent filing stage which gets support from the Union government.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Super Tatkal was doing relatively well. “The users kept growing and I launched a second app—Super Tatkal Pro—which allowed booking on IRCTC’s rail connect app in 2019,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep his startup alive and to support his family, Yuvarajaa also worked as a freelance programmer. The income was small but steady. However, unbeknownst to Yuvarajaa, his app was on the Railway police’s radar.&nbsp;</p><p>“RPF Cyber Cell at Southern Railway Headquarters Chennai had played a key role in analysis of data and identification of the fake app developer’s location and also collected digital evidences i.e server source code, application source code, end-users list and bank statements of the offender,” the Railway police said in their press release.</p><p>Yuvarajaa’s mistake, an officer at the security command centre of RPF told <em>HuffPost India</em>, was that “he did not obtain the needed permission from IRCTC and was working like a ticketing agent”.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Railways Act, all those who help passengers with ticketing are expected to register with the IRCTC as an agent. Does this apply for app creators? The officer reserved his comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yuvarajaa, however, said that he was “trying to create something of value for people” and that he “was not aware that the app would be considered illegal”. IRCTC could have sent him a warning or a cease-and-desist order before swooping in, he rued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arunachalam, of the Indian School of Business, said Yuvarajaa’s case points to the need for more mentorship in India’s start-up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“He does not seem to have understood the process well,” Arunachalam said.</p><p>Back in Tirupur, Yuvarajaa said that he hopes to work with the Railways once his legal troubles end.</p><p>Will he revive his apps if he gets the required permission from IRCTC?&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like to,” he said.</p><p><em>This story was corrected to say that Yuvarajaa was arrested on October 23 and spent about a week in jail, not a month-and-a-half.</em></p></div>

You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue. If it's not, have you thought about who is filling this role on your team?</p><p>Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful.

They were writing code the whole time, and I was on the phone the whole time, and being in the office we ended up interrupting each other. So eventually we started working from our homes and only got together when we needed to catch up.</p><p>As the company grew, we were hiring lots of artists and freelancers based everywhere from Los Angeles to Toronto. Even though there were more of us, it didn’t make sense for us to have an office space when most of the team was somewhere else anyway. We could simply hop on Skype, have our conversation, and get back to work. We became addicted to our ability to source really great talent from anywhere in the world, and addicted to the productivity of not having to worry about the overhead of an office, the time wasted commuting every day, or the frustration of having to find a space to meet up.</p><figure id="attachment_11249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11249"><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" data-size="{&quot;w&quot;:1920,&quot;h&quot;:1280}"><img loading="lazy" src="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg" alt="The Mattermost team" width="2560" height="640" srcset="https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-300x75.jpg 300w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1024x256.jpg 1024w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-768x192.jpg 768w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-1536x384.jpg 1536w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-2048x512.jpg 2048w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-716x179.jpg 716w, https://youteam.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/LIBanner2-820x205.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11249">The Mattermost team</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t to say scaling a remote team has been easy. We’ve learned a lot about what makes for a great remote experience. Here are a few of the lessons learned about the challenges of remote work, and how we make it work for our team.</p><h2><strong>Pair design helps remote collaboration run smoothly</strong></h2><p>One of the superpowers of a remote team is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/">embracing the ability to work asynchronously</a>. Unfortunately, this can also make large group collaboration more challenging. There are certain problems you might want a relatively large group to work together — for example, planning our annual onsite. In an office setting, you’d just get those four or five or seven people together camped out in a conference room for a whole week, knocking out the problem. But it can be particularly challenging to wrangle a large group of people to carve out a long chunk of time to work together remotely. Everyone has other priorities they’re trying to juggle.</p><p>We’ve found what works best for remote collaboration is keeping the collaboration smaller. We try to apply <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/benefits-of-design-pairing-2a3ceb0bdfac?gi=df46f7c04818">pair design</a> practices wherever we can; if you can break down and prioritize bigger problems into smaller problems two people can tackle, they can work through the problem, talk through it, and agree on it. Then, when they come back to a broader group, they come in with a much more polished solution and it’s easier to get an idea implemented.</p><h2><strong>Documentation is the secret to great onboarding and culture building</strong></h2><p>There’s a bit of a misconception that companies can only build stronger cultures in-person versus remote. I would say culture is stronger when everything is written down because everyone who joins the company has the same baseline: a consistent onboarding experience and documentation as the shared source of truth.</p><p>Remote onboarding done right can be far more scalable, efficient, and impactful. We get a good deal of positive feedback for our onboarding process at Mattermost because <a href="https://handbook.mattermost.com/operations/workplace/people/working-at-mattermost/onboarding">everything is documented</a>. In-office onboarding experiences are usually a series of person-to-person interactions that mete out information bit by bit — you might talk to 18 different people throughout the day, each with a different piece of the organizational puzzle. When you’re a remote company, onboarding is a lot more focused on reading through information.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong — new hires at Mattermost still talk to a lot of people in their first few weeks —&nbsp;but the interactions they have are more meaningful because they’ve gotten all the administrative stuff out of the way. New hires can get up to speed on the history and context of ongoing projects and initiatives when they join and can start asking much higher quality, deep questions during those first interactions.</p><h2><strong>To find great remote employees, prioritize candidates with strong writing skills</strong></h2><p>One thing that’s become even more clear during the pandemic: there are people who really like working remote and thrive in a remote work environment, but it’s not for everyone. Right now everyone needs to work remotely. While many people have realized working from home is amazing — they love not having to commute, they love the independence, the flexibility — there are others who really miss the office environment.</p><p>One of the biggest indicators that we’ve found around who thrives in a remote environment is strong written communication skills. If you’re a strong writer and you can consume information in written formats really well, you’ll probably have an easier time transitioning to a remote team than someone who prefers face-to-face communication.</p><h2><strong>Want to join Mattermost’s remote-first team?</strong></h2><p>Mattermost is on a mission to connect the world with what matters most, and we’re continually looking for people to help us achieve that goal —&nbsp;no matter where in the world they live.&nbsp;To learn more about what it’s like to work at Mattermost and to see our current open roles, check out our <a href="https://mattermost.com/careers/">Careers page</a>.</p></div></article></div>]]>

            <p>If you’ve ever seen a Kubernetes demo, it probably involved a terminal and someone typing commands using kubectl and arcane yaml configuration files. This might be a powerful workflow for experts, but in an age when everything has a slick web interface, it is not the most accessible user experience. It <strong>steepens the learning curve</strong> for those new to Kubernetes, and <strong>presents a barrier</strong> to occasional users.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several graphical user interfaces available for Kubernetes, including the <em>Kubernetes Dashboard</em> project that is part of upstream Kubernetes itself. However, when we researched the landscape, we couldn’t find a solution that covered everything we were looking for. Specifically, our criteria were:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% open source</li>
<li>Actively maintained</li>
<li>Generic, in the sense of not being tied to a specific vendor’s Kubernetes distro</li>
<li>Modular and extensible</li>
<li>Clean, modern user interface</li>
<li>Implemented using a stack that was familiar to our development team (Go, Javascript/Typescript, React)</li>
<li>An interactive UI that allows read-write operations, not just a read-only dashboard</li>
<li>Multi-cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the good number of alternatives, the reality is that none of the solutions we tested at the time really matched all the points in our criteria or was a good base to start from. So, in the time-honored tradition, we decided to build one ourselves…</p>

<p>Today, I am <strong>proud to announce the general availability of a new UI for Kubernetes</strong>: 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/headlamp" target="_blank">Headlamp</a>
.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_overview.png" alt="Headlamp"></p>
<p>Headlamp is a generic and extensible Kubernetes UI that meets the criteria mentioned above. Of course, coming from Kinvolk, it is 100% open source. We hope many Kubernetes community members will not just enjoy using Headlamp, but also contribute back to the project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick spin through some of its core features.</p>
<h2 id="extensible-ui">Extensible UI</h2>
<p>We want Headlamp to be used for as many different use-cases as possible. That includes not only novice Kubernetes users, but also experienced operators, as well as Kubernetes vendors with very different needs. Often, particularly for UI projects, such a breadth of use cases can only be addressed by downstream users maintaining their own fork. But keeping forks up to date becomes more challenging the deeper the changes are.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have a plugin system. So Headlamp supports out-of-tree UI plugins: Javascript files that are loaded by Headlamp’s backend and passed to the client which dynamically loads them.</p>
<p>This opens up Headlamp to innovation, <strong>fostering a wealth of new functionality</strong>. For example, if you want to add a button to the Pod details view that will redirect the user to a service showing how much the Pod is costing to operate, that should be easy to implement.</p>
<p>We see Headlamp’s plug-in capabilities as a great opportunity for the community. We are eager to collaborate with others who want to develop new Headlamp plugins, or enhance the plugin system itself to support other use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="traceloop">Traceloop</h3>
<p>As an <strong>example of the power of the plug-in system</strong>, and an incredibly useful tool in its own right, we have developed a 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive-web-ui/tree/master/plugins/ig-traces" target="_blank">Headlamp plugin for the traceloop gadget</a>
 of our 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget" target="_blank">Inspektor Gadget</a>
 project.</p>
<p>When Inspektor Gadget is installed in a cluster and the traceloop gadget is enabled, it <strong>records all syscalls from a pod</strong> into a ring buffer. This buffer can be seen in real-time as the pod is running, allowing a lens into what the pod is doing right now, but is also saved for terminated pods. This allows operators to see what caused a crash, after it happens – like a “flight data recorder” for your Kubernetes apps.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/traces.gif" alt="Traces plugin for Headlamp"></p>
<h2 id="role-aware-ui">Role-aware UI</h2>
<p>One problem with many read-write (CRUD) user interfaces is that they are not aware of underlying access controls. For example, displaying the update/delete buttons is misleading if the user has actually no permissions to modify the resource. So Headlamp checks Kubernetes RBAC settings and displays only those controls whose actions can be performed. So, if the user does not have permission to edit a resource, the edit button will not be displayed.</p>
<p>This results in a much better UX, because it is obvious to the operator what actions are available based on their permissions at the time. In particular, this is great for situations where time-limited credentials are granted to operators (e.g. temporary deletion permissions on a resource).</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_permissions.png" alt="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions" title="Pod when the user has update/delete permissions">

<sub>Pod when the user has no update/delete permissions</sub></p>
<h2 id="design--user-interface">Design / User Interface</h2>
<p>We wanted Headlamp’s design to be as <strong>clean and modern</strong> as possible, yet without breaking with a more “traditional” Kubernetes UI or dashboard style. For example, we think that showing a familiar table-based view is very helpful, and we hope other visualizations, such as a graph-based representation of the cluster, can be implemented through plugins.</p>
<p>To implement Headlamp’s frontend, we chose to use React with the 


<a href="https://material-ui.com/" target="_blank">Material UI</a>
 library, because it is modern, clean, and is well maintained with a large user community. It also has the advantage that it is the same technology stack that we use in our 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/nebraska" target="_blank">Nebraska</a>
 project, enabling sharing of expertise and resources, and supporting a consistent UI across all our products.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-vs-in-cluster">Desktop vs In-cluster</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes UIs can be categorized as either a hosted (often in-cluster) backend, such as the original Kubernetes Dashboard, or a local desktop application, such as VMware’s 


<a href="https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant" target="_blank">Octant</a>
 project.</p>
<p>Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, when run as a hosted application, it’s very simple to just share a URL with users, and have them log in through OIDC. It’s available “everywhere”, and it’s easy to keep it up-to-date with the cluster version. Conversely, with a desktop application, there’s no need to host the UI application, keeping things more isolated, but the burden of keeping the app up to date falls on the user.</p>
<p>With Headlamp, you <strong>don’t have to choose</strong> between these two approaches, as we support both. It can be easily <strong>hosted in-cluster</strong> by using/adapting the YAML files we provide, or <strong>installed locally</strong> on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="multi-cluster-support">Multi-cluster support</h2>
<p>Most Kubernetes deployments involve multiple clusters, even if that’s just to separate a development from a production environment. Thus, Headlamp <strong>allows you to access all your clusters</strong> - with the exact method depending on whether you’re running as a hosted, or a local (desktop), application.</p>
<p>When run locally, Headlamp will read the kube config and display the contexts available there, allowing the user to change when needed just by setting the local environment variable to the appropriate cluster.</p>
<p>The way the multi-cluster support works is straightforward: it creates a proxy for each configured cluster, and redirects requests from the UI (with the Kubernetes API calls) to the right cluster address. Shout-out here to the 


<a href="https://github.com/indeedeng/k8dash" target="_blank">K8dash</a>
 project, whose request/API management modules we reused in the development of Headlamp.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to mix this with running in-cluster, though this does require the cluster running the application to have API access to the other configured clusters.</p>
<p><img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/headlamp_cluster_chooser.png" alt="Cluster Chooser" title="Cluster chooser dialog"></p>

<p>You may be aware that Kinvolk also has a Kubernetes distribution, 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive" target="_blank">Lokomotive</a>
. While Headlamp is of course used within Lokomotive as the basis for its web user interface, it is important to note that these are separate and independent projects. True to our goal of being independent of any particular distro, <strong>Headlamp is designed to support any conformant Kubernetes cluster</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy to try out Headlamp</strong>: just apply the deployment manifest to your cluster and point your browser to the Headlamp service, or download and install the desktop application for Windows, Mac, or Linux. For details, see the 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/docs/headlamp/latest/installation" target="_blank">documentation</a>
.</p>
<p>Headlamp is fully open source, released under the Apache 2.0 terms and, as mentioned above, we created it to be a generic and vendor-independent Kubernetes UI that we hope can suit many use-cases. So we encourage anyone interested to take part.</p>

<p><strong>We hope you enjoy Headlamp!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Growing up, the only thing that put me off while learning software development, was the common occurrence of people who cared more about one upping others with their trivia knowledge rather than actually building things.</p>
<p>At the start of my career I had a difficult time differentiating between them and actual top performers because the industry still thought there was a strong correlation between jerks and highly productive people. Employers used to be afraid something will go wrong if they fired a mythical 10x engineer and no one else understood how to fix their systems.</p>
<p>After 15 years what I've learned is that engineers that produce orders of magnitude more than others exist<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, but the way they are talked about is overly exaggerated. They’re usually not jerks either, at least not more than the rest of the population.</p>
<p>If you find a project where only one person know what is going on, chances are that person is not good at writing code for humans, not that is a coding god.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t often consider is that you don’t have to hire the very top of the field to find people that are orders better than the industry average. Even more important than finding great engineers is to avoid bad ones<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Being obsessed with finding a 10x engineer, is to be obsessed with shortcuts and Hail Marys. It will hurt you in the long run if you’re focusing on that instead of building solid fundamentals.</p>
<p>Ultimately I am convinced that focusing on building teams is more important than finding individual outliers. Of course the John Carmacks, the Jeff Deans, the Fabrice Bellards, of the industry exist, but your startup isn’t going to die if you don’t find one. It will die if you don’t build a good team.</p>
<h2>Good reads on individual and team performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Steve McConnell, has a great summary of existing studies that support the 10x theory in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/productivity-variations-among-software-developers-and-teams-the-origin-of-10x/">“Individual Productivity Variation in Software Development”</a>. </li>
<li>McConnell also recognizes the aforementioned studies are not perfect in <a href="https://www.construx.com/blog/the-origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research/">“Origins of 10X – How Valid is the Underlying Research?”</a>. But the lack of studies contradicting the current findings and the abundance of anecdotal stories signals towards confirmation.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415178">“Leadership, Team Building, and Team Member Characteristics in High Performance Project Teams”</a> the authors identify 9 themes<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> as potential predictors of team performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.2002.11415147">“Linking Project Team Performance with Team Health”</a> the authors emphasize that team building is a long term strategy that does not happen overnight by itself. Organizations must invest if they want to build healthy, high performing teams.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1999.11415013">“An Empirical Study of the Relationship Between Team Performance and Team Maturity”</a> the authors measure the impact of changes in team dynamics, and make a correlation of team maturity with high performance teams. They mention how persistance is required to move to higher performance.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10429247.1990.11414554">“Innovative Performance in Research, Development, and Engineering”</a> the authors identify 12 factors<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> that strongly influence innovative work environments:</li>
