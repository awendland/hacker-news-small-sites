<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img src="https://carlschwan.eu/assets/img/heading_hugo.png" alt="Screenshot KDE.org"></p>

<p><a href="https://kde.org/">KDE.org</a> now uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Hugo is a fast and modern static site
generator written in Go. It provides a few improvements over the old system that was
using plain PHP. A large part of the work was done by Anuj during GSoC 2020. This
was a massive work, converting the repository storing more than 20 years of KDE
history.</p>

<p>The website is now generated once and no longer uses PHP to generate itself at runtime.
This improves the loading speed of the website, but the speed boost is not significant,
since the PHP code used before was quite small and KDE’s servers are powerful.</p>

<p>But the biggest improvement is in terms of features. We are now working with markdown
files instead of raw HTML files, this makes the life of the promo team much easier.</p>

<p>The internationalization of the website now creates a unique URL per language, this
should allow Google to link to the version of the website using the correct language.
A <a href="https://kde.org/fr/">French</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/uk/">Ukrainian</a>,
<a href="https://kde.org/ca/">Catalan</a>, <a href="https://kde.org/nl/">Dutch</a>, and a few more languages
are already available. There is also a proper language selector! We also don’t need
to manually tag each string for translations.</p>

<p>There is also now an <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/index.xml">RSS feed</a> with all the
latest announcements. Another big improvement is that the announcements list is
autogenerated and no longer modified by hand and with the help of the release scripts.</p>

<p>Another nice change for website developers is that now the SCSS code for the individual
pages is located in the kde-org repository itself instead of another repository.
Overall the developer experience is much better, there is no need to set up an apache
server and to the PHP configs to include the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/websites/capacity">capacity framework</a>, just to get the
website running locally. Now you only need to download the Hugo binary from their
release page and run it on the repo.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-and-gettext">Hugo and Gettext</h2>

<p>The internationalization of KDE.org was quite a challenge. When working on a multilingual
website with Hugo, Hugo expects a markdown document per language for each translated
page.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plasma-desktop.md
plasma-desktop.es.md
plasma-desktop.fr.md
plasma-desktop.uk.md
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is that traditional translations workflow rely on a string-based approach,
where a document is split in paragraphs and translated individually. So I couldn’t
just put each file markdown file as big blobs in the po files. To solve this problem,
I created a python script splitting the markdown files in paragraphs, simplifying
the markdown syntax (removing leading <code>#</code> and <code>+</code> for heading and list item). This
script also handles Hugo shortcodes transforming:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; img caption="My figure caption" alt="My accessible description" src="..." &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in two strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My figure caption</li>
  <li>My accessible description</li>
</ul>

<p>The script can obliviously put the individual strings back in place. The scripts also
handle the menu translation, and the translations of the strings in the footers.
For now, the script is just a file in the kde-org repository, but I would like to
transform it to a standalone library so that other gettext and Hugo users can
translate their website.</p>

<p>Using Hugo API, the language selector was trivial to write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
&lt;ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto"&gt;
  {{ if .IsTranslated }}
    &lt;li class="nav-item dropdown" aria-describedby="language-picker-description"&gt;
      &lt;p class="sr-only" id="language-picker-description"&gt;{{ i18n "Select-your-language" }}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/Language-Icons/icon20x24px-exported-transparent.png" alt="" /&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;{{ i18n "translations" }}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="dropdown-menu dropdonw-trans" role="listbox"&gt;
        &lt;a class="dropdown-item" aria-selected="true" hreflang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Site.Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Site.Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ range .Translations }}
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" hreflang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" role="option" lang="{{ .Language.Lang }}" href="{{ .Permalink }}"&gt;{{ .Language.LanguageName }}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{ end }}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a bit verbose because this selector is also fully accessible for screen readers.</p>

<p>There are a few more tricks employed in kde.org to improve the internationalization, for
example when a page doesn’t exist in a language, there is an Apache rule redirecting it
to the English version. Another nice trick is that there is a special Hugo shortcode
called <code>i18n_var</code> and used to parametrize the strings. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
{{&lt; i18n_var "Today KDE releases a bugfix update to KDE Plasma 5, versioned %[1]s" "5.20.2" &gt;}}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the extractor is clever and only extract the part that needs to be translated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When we started work on the recently released feature <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/review-changes">Review Changes</a>, we needed a way to keep a significant part of the edit history of a document in the browser memory to be able to respond quickly to different user interface states. As the user picked various document versions to compare we wanted to be able to quickly reconstruct a specific section of the history of a document. </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="false"></div></div><figcaption>Review Changes for Sanity Studio. Powered by Mendoza.</figcaption></figure><p>For text diffs, we use the <a href="https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch">diff-match-patch format</a>, and we just assumed someone would have implemented a similarly efficient and compact diff format for JSON documents, but no such luck. If we wanted a general JSON diff format that was super compact and fast to apply, we would have to invent it ourselves. And thus, Mendoza, the totally non-human readable diff format for structured JSON documents, was born.</p><p>Mendoza is:</p><ul><li>Lightweight JSON format</li><li>A flexible format that can accommodate more advanced encodings in the future</li><li>As a Go library for encoding and decoding</li><li>A JavaScript library for decoding</li><li>Efficient handling of the renaming of fields</li><li>Efficient handling of reordering of arrays</li><li>Not designed to be human-readable</li></ul><p>Mendoza differs (hah!) from normal diffs as they are:</p><ul><li>Made for humans to read and understand and based on simple operations (like keep, insert, and delete text)</li><li>Possible to apply even if the source has changed a bit by including some of the contexts around every part that has changed</li><li>Designed for text, and not structured documents</li></ul><p>Now, this is great when you are collaborating with humans on code development and use something like git to track your changes. What it isnâ€™t great for, however, is expressing differences between structured documents (such as JSON) in a compact manner that can be efficiently transferred over the network and parsed in JavaScript inside of browsers.</p><div data-block-key="27e85758c59a"><h2><a id="most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"></a><a href="#most-diffs-arent-meant-for-machines-27e85758c59a"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Most diffs aren't meant for machines</h2></div><p>Most diff formats are made to be human-readable.

The integers are <em>opcodes</em> (short for â€œoperation codesâ€�), 8-bit numbers that correspond to an operation. Opcodes take parameters as strings, positive numbers, or JSON values (that is: the actual data that is changing). The list of available opcodes is as follows, notice that 10-18 are composites of the preceding ones:</p><ul><li>0 <code>Value<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>1 <code>Copy<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>2 <code>Blank<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>3 <code>ReturnIntoArray<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>4 <code>ReturnIntoObject<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>5 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKey<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>6 <code>PushField<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>7 <code>PushElement<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>8 <code>PushParent<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>9 <code>Pop<!-- -->â€‹ </code></li><li>10 <code>PushFieldCopy</code></li><li>11 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>12 <code>PushElementCopy</code></li><li>13 <code>PushFieldBlank</code></li><li>14 <code>ReturnIntoObjectPop</code></li><li>15 <code>ReturnIntoObjectSameKeyPop</code></li><li>16 <code>ReturnIntoArrayPop</code></li><li>17 <code>ObjectSetFieldValue</code></li><li>18 <code>ObjectCopyField</code></li><li>19 <code>ObjectDeleteField</code>â€‹ </li><li>20 <code>ArrayAppendValue</code>â€‹ </li><li>21 <code>ArrayAppendSlice<!-- -->â€‹</code></li><li>22 <code>StringAppendString<!-- -->â€‹</code></li></ul><p>Mendoza reads these opcodes from the patch and produces the resulting document from them. Depending on the patch, Mendoza might choose not to strictly follow the opcodes but take a simpler path. If every field and value has changed, for example, itâ€™s more efficient just to replace the whole document with the new data without going through all the operations. Or if you have a list of objects where one has moved to another position and changed a key-value, Mendoza will manage to go back to the original and represent the change in a cheap way.</p><p>Mendoza is implemented in Go and can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza">GitHub repository</a>. We have also made <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/mendoza-js">a parser for Mendoza patches in JavaScript</a>, that you can use in your own application. </p><p>Of course, you can dive into <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity/blob/a3f7158016d63728a9b435e6ab444ff2b90fd424/packages/%40sanity/desk-tool/src/panes/documentPane/documentHistory/history/timeline.ts#L421">the source code for the Sanity Studio</a> and explore how Mendoza is used there. If you want a slightly simpler use-case, you can also <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store/blob/main/src/patch.ts">check out how weâ€™re using Mendoza to simulate a part of Sanityâ€™s real-time datastore</a> in the browser to power the <a href="https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity">real-time preview for Next.js</a>. </p><p>Naming a project is always difficult. Since this project is focused on representing changes between <em>JSON</em> documents I naturally started thinking about names like "JSON differ, JSON changes, JSON patch, â€¦". However, most of these names have already been used by existing projects. While I was muttering "JSON, JSON, JSON" it suddenly turned into "JSON, JSON, Jason, Jason Mendoza".</p><p>Jason Mendoza is a character from the show The Good Place, and while this project has little in common with the stupidest DJ from Florida, at least it's short and catchy.</p><p>Since a Mendoza patch is just describing the effect of a change it is also limited to work for the documents it was based on. It doesnâ€™t come with guarantees for consistency if the document you apply it on has changed from the original in meanwhile. This is one of the tradeoffs that we needed to do to make it really compressed. </p></div></div></div>]]>

October 30, 2020 | https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I was a power user of <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for many years, so I had mixed
feelings recently about <a href="https://archive.is/zpx2r">their decision</a> to change
their pricing model. Under IFTTT's new pricing, you can only have 3 “custom”
actions created/enabled at any time – which is quite a downgrade from the
current unlimited free plan. On the one hand, I'm glad to see IFTTT take
necessary steps to ensure it has long-term financial stability, but on the other
hand, I don't personally get enough value from their service anymore to justify
a recurring cost. (The plan will likely be
$4/month<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but if you sign up before a deadline, you
can lock in a price as low as $2/month)</p>
<p>IFTTT was an awesome and uniquely easy-to-use service when it first came out,
but now there are better options for personal automation for people like me, who
like to tinker with this sort of thing. Systems like
<a href="https://nodered.org/">node-red</a> and iOS shortcuts can be self hosted or run on
device, and they provide more sophisticated logic for workflows than IFTTT.</p>
<p>I stayed on IFTTT this long mostly due to inertia, and it's fantastically long
list of supported services. If I needed to throw together a quick
spreadsheet-recording automation, or cron-like trigger, IFTTT was a great
starting place. However, it does have limitations. Until now (though it seems
like this might change with their premium offering), IFTTT basically only did
what its name implied: “if this, then that”. No “if X then Y else Z”, no “if X
and Z then Y”, etc. Often times, you don't need any complicated logic or
filtering, but it was frustrating that there wasn't the option for more advanced
automation. Ultimately, IFTTT had a great “on-ramp”, but once you were on board
with their system, you realize how shallow it is. Excellent breadth, mediocre
depth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the past couple years IFTTT's UI has leaned heavily into the
“applet” metaphor, with these big goofy toggle switches to enable/disable
automations. The site also transitioned towards a focus on community- (or, more
often corporate-) created automations, at the expense of the experience for
creating your own applets. Like seriously, why is 30% of the UI for an applet
<em>details page</em> (!) taken up by the connection status toggle?</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>The settings page, too, is woefully information sparse. As a user, this makes me
feel that desktop-usability was not high on IFTTT's design priorities. You have
to scroll the page to begin to start to see what the automation is doing:</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/ifttt-settings.png">

        </a>
</figure>

<p>Eventually, the UI got to the point where it felt like using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Duplo">Duplos</a> or something. It didn't have
to be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable
interfaces, like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a>.</p>
<figure>
    
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png">
        
            
        
        <img src="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/10/30/Goodbye-IFTTT/scratch.png" loading="lazy"> 
        </a>
</figure>

<p>So, I decided to migrate away, since the move to premium was already going to
substantially limit what I could do with IFTTT. In going through my catalog of
IFTTT “applets”, I identified 3 main patterns of automations that I used IFTTT
for: (1) triggering an action to happen at a specific time, (2) triggering an
action to happen in response to a location change (i.e. geofencing), or (3)
triggering an action to happen in response to an event in a web service.</p>
<p>Of these 3 buckets, iOS shortcuts readily handles the first 2: as of iOS 14,
Shortcuts can be triggered in the background at a specific time of day, or in
response to entering/leaving a geofence. Shortcuts also has a much more
sophisticated integration with iOS than any of IFTTT's apps, so more exciting
mobile automation becomes possible – for example, setting my phone to Low Power
Mode once the battery drops below a certain threshold. Of course, you are
restricted to apps/services that support Shortcuts, and the number of supported
services is considerably smaller than IFTTT.</p>
<p>Node-red handles buckets 1 and 3: it has good support for time-based actions,
and can receive webhooks to respond to events from external services. It also
has a great plugin ecosystem, so it's support begins to rival IFTTT's impressive
selection of supported services. Additionally, node-red has many “escape
hatches” that IFTTT does not: you can use it to make raw HTTP requests and write
your own plugins/logic in Javascript, allowing for much more complex automation.</p>
<p>Neither node-red nor iOS shortcuts are as easy to use as IFTTT for putting
together a simple automation, which is a shame. However, between them (and other
alternative automation frameworks that I've trialed, like <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/huginn/huginn">huginn</a>), I've more than covered my
personal automation needs.</p>
<p>And so, goodbye IFTTT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm not put off by them charging for their service; I
think charging for software is a good thing! It's just that this was the nudge I
needed to move my automations to infrastructure that I have more control over,
which has other benefits outside the scope of this article. I'm thankful that a
service like IFTTT continues to exist; I still think it's a fantastic tool to
“on-ramp” less technical folks into automation and no-code tools.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The other day, I was watching Bryan Cantrill’s 2018 talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wZ1pCpJUIM">Rust, and Other Interesting Things</a>, and he made an offhanded comment while discussing values of different programming languages and communities. He said, “If you get the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">awk programming language manual</a>…you’ll read it in about two hours and then you’re done. That’s it. You know all of awk.”</p>

<p>Only two hours to learn an entire language?! …. Challenge accepted!</p>

<p>I had previously used snippets of awk here and there. Most of them were given to me by Stack Overflow answers when googling for niche data file manipulations. But, I did not know enough to successfully write an awk program from scratch. I definitely did not have a real grasp on the language nor its power. And, a couple of hours sounded like a relatively small time investment to learn what Bryan Cantrill said was a language he used three times a day.</p>

<p>It turns out it takes more than two hours to learn awk, and I am by no means an expert… yet (growth mindset!). But, I now know enough to write a little about the essentials. Here goes!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-awk-useful-for">What is awk useful for?</h3>

<p>Awk is useful for data file manipulation. Already, having used it for a few days only, I wish I had invested time in learning it earlier. My usual workflow when encountering a data file is to import it into Google Sheets and use their builtin functions. If those weren’t enough, I would write little code snippets to somewhat awk..wardly get the information I want. Awk is way more powerful than what I was doing before. Let’s take a look:</p>

<h3 id="running-awk-programs">Running awk programs</h3>

<p>If we’re going to learn awk, we need to know how to run an awk program. The syntax to run an awk program in a shell is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'awk_program_contents'</span> data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We can also write a longer awk program to run instead of writing the awk code inline. We could write a file with awk codeand then pass inline to awk with <code>-f &lt;awk-program-filename&gt;</code></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-f</span> awk-program.awk data-file-1 data-file-2
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="awk-program-contents">awk program contents</h3>

<p>Well, what is an awk program? We know it is best used for simple data reformatting or manipulation. The way it does this is by performing different actions on different patterns within a data file. The basic syntax of an awk program depends on these pattern and actions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
pattern <span>{</span> action <span>}</span>
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can give as many <code>pattern { action }</code> pairs as we want. Each pair will be executed independently of the others. This means if a line matches more than one pattern, it will have more than one corresponding action. In the example above we use newlines to separate distinct pairs. Similar to bash, we can also use <code>;</code> to separate commands and put everything on one line: <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action }</code></p>

<h3 id="awk-with-data-files">awk with data files</h3>

<p>But, it turns out awk is much more useful (and fun!) with a data file. The UN has a few <a href="https://data.un.org/">publicly available datasets</a>. I picked <a href="https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_309_201906_Education.csv">this one</a> on education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to delve into first.</p>

<p>Let’s start by using awk to get a sense of what the data looks like.  <code>NR</code> is a predefined variable which records the number of rows read in a file so far. We can use it to look at the first few lines of a program. In this case, our pattern will be <code>NR &lt;= 5</code>, and by not including an action, the implied action will be <code>print</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>,,,,,
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Students enrolled <span>in </span>primary education <span>(</span>thousands<span>)</span>,<span>"678,991.6070"</span>,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollement ratio - Primary <span>(</span>male<span>)</span>,104.9360,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
1,<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>,2005,Gross enrollment ratio - Primary <span>(</span>female<span>)</span>,99.9214,,<span>"United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Montreal, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database, last accessed March 2019."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Okay, so looks like this is giving us a bit of information about our file. Notably:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are two header rows: a title row, and a row telling us what the fields are</li>
  <li>The file is comma separated</li>
  <li>… except there are sometimes commas within double quoted strings: <code>"Total, all countries or areas"</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s address these one by one!</p>



<p>We can ignore the first two header rows by using our nifty <code>NR</code> moving forward. We can pattern match that <code>NR &gt; 2</code>. Note: awk is 1-indexed.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &gt; 2'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="field-separators">Field Separators</h3>

<p>awk’s <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Default-Field-Splitting">default field separator</a> is a space. We can actually see this by printing the first field. To access the value of a field, we use <code>$&lt;field_index&gt;</code>. So <code>$1</code> is the first field, <code>$2</code> the second, and so on. <code>$0</code> refers to the entire row.</p>

<p>If we try this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07,<span>"Enrolment
Region/Country/Area,,Year,Series,Value,Footnotes,Source
1,"</span>Total,
1,<span>"Total,
1,"</span>Total,
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>we can confirm that we’re splitting on spaces. awk has the option to specify a different field separator with the <code>-F 'separator'</code> flag:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $1 }'</span> education.csv
T07
Region/Country/Area
1
1
1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Great! But…. we had commas embedded within strings with double quotes. Sure enough, if we print the second field (<code>$2</code>), we see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>-F</span> <span>','</span> <span>'NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary

"</span>Total
<span>"Total
"</span>Total
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hmmm. What we want here is to split fields by <em>content</em>. Which awk does not have, but gawk (GNU awk) does: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Splitting-By-Content">FPAT</a>! From the gawk manual: “All properly written awk programs should work with gawk. So most of the time, we don’t distinguish between gawk and other awk implementations.”</p>

<p>Sounds like we can use gawk here instead then. Let’s try pattern matching. I’m not going to go into regex here, but the pattern we want, defined by <code>"[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\""</code> is anything that either starts with a non-comma character, or starts with a double quote, contains only non-quote characters, and ends with a double quote:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gawk <span>'BEGIN { FPAT = "[^,]*|\"[^\"]+\"" } NR &lt;= 5 { print $2 }'</span> education.csv
<span>"Enrolment in primary, secondary and tertiary education levels"</span>

<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
<span>"Total, all countries or areas"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I snuck a <code>BEGIN</code> in there without explaining it. Let’s go on a brief tangent…</p>

<h3 id="begin--tangent-">BEGIN { tangent }</h3>

<p>Beyond the pattern and actions, awk also has a concept of <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> blocks. The <code>BEGIN</code> is executed before any of the data is processed. It can be useful for declaring variables or printing text to appear at the beginning. Analogously, the <code>END</code> is executed after the data is processed. It can be useful for performing manipulations on aggregates of the data, like averaging a sum.</p>

<p>This means if we wanted to write a little “Hello, awk!” program, we could do it without even needing a data file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'BEGIN { print "Hello, awk!" }'</span>
Hello, <span>awk</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="end--tangent-">END { tangent }</h3>

<p>…back to our example. In our case, we used a <code>BEGIN</code> block to declare the <code>FPAT</code> <em>before</em> reading our data file.</p>

<p>But, we’ve only looked at the first 5 lines. For all we know, the rest of the file could look completely different. Let’s use <code>NR</code> again to see some more of the file. First, let’s figure out how long the file is. We can use the <code>END</code> block here. After we’ve parsed the whole file, we can see what the value of <code>NR</code> is, and that’ll tell us how many lines it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'END { print NR }'</span> education.csv
8630
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, so maybe if we print every 500 lines, we’ll get a sense of what data we’re looking at. We can set our pattern to be only if <code>NR</code> is a multiple of <code>500</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>awk</span> <span>'NR % 500 == 0'</span> education.csv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… and I’m going to leave this blog post on a real cliff hanger. Mostly because it already feels too long! There’s <a href="https://jemma.dev/blog/awk-part-2">a second post</a> about awk actually looking at the data and manipulating it to figure out which countries have stark differences in number of males and females that they educate.</p>

<h3 id="tldr-or-tlskimmed-far-enough-to-get-here-please-give-me-the-shorter-version">TL;DR or TL;Skimmed far enough to get here, please give me the shorter version:</h3>
<p>To rehash what we’ve learned about awk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>awk is run using <code>awk 'awk_program' data-file</code></li>
  <li>awk programs have the form <code>pattern { action }; pattern { action };</code></li>
  <li><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are executed before reading data files</li>
  <li><code>END</code> blocks are executed after reading data files</li>
  <li><code>NR</code> is a variable that tells us the number of rows read</li>
  <li><code>-F '&lt;separator&gt;'</code> is how we can define a field separator for a file</li>
  <li>Space is the default field separator</li>
  <li><code>FPAT="..."</code> is a way to use regex to define a pattern for each field</li>
  <li><code>FPAT</code> is only defined in gawk</li>
</ul>

October 30, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/rust-as-productive-as-kotlin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="preamble">
<div>
<p>In this article, we will compare one apple (IntelliJ Rust) to one orange (rust-analyzer) to reach general and sweeping conclusions.
Specifically, I want to present a case study supporting the following claim:</p>
<p>For complex applications, Rust is as productive as Kotlin.</p>
<p>For me, this is an unusual claim to argue: I always thought exactly the opposite, but I am not so sure now.
I came to Rust from C++.
I was of the opinion that this is a brilliant low-level language and always felt puzzled at people writing higher-level things in Rust.
Clearly, choosing Rust means taking a productivity hit, and using Kotlin, C# or Go just makes much more sense if you can afford GC.
My <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">list of Rust criticisms</a> starts with this objection.</p>
<p>What moved my position in the other direction was my experience as the lead developer of rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust.
Let me introduce the two projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust"><strong>IntelliJ Rust</strong></a> is the plugin for IntelliJ Platform, providing Rust support.
In effect, it is a Rust compiler front-end, written in Kotlin and making use of language-support features of the platform.
These features include lossless syntax trees, a parser generator, persistence and indexing infrastructure, among others.
Nonetheless, as programming languages differ lot, the bulk of logic for analyzing Rust is implemented in the plugin itself.
Presentational features like completion list come from the platform, but most of the language semantics is hand-written.
IntelliJ Rust also includes a bit of a Swing GUI.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer"><strong>rust-analyzer</strong></a> is an implementation of
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Rust.
It is a Rust compiler front-end written from scratch with an eye towards IDE support.
It makes heavy use of <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">salsa</a> library for incremental computations.
Beyond the compiler itself, rust-analyzer includes code for managing long-lived multithreaded process of the language server itself.</p>
<p>The projects are essentially equivalent in scope — rust compiler front-ends suitable for IDEs.
The two biggest differences are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IntelliJ Rust is a plugin, so it can re-use code and design patterns of the surrounding platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rust-analyzer is the second system, so it leverages experience of IntelliJ Rust for a from-scratch design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The internal architecture of the two projects also differs a lot.
In terms of <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2020/07/20/three-architectures-for-responsive-ide.html">Three Architectures</a>, IntelliJ Rust is map-reduce, and rust-analyzer is query-based.</p>
<p>Writing an IDE-ready compiler is a high-level task.
You don’t need to talk to the operating system directly.
There are some fancy data structures and concurrency here and there, but they are also high-level.
It’s not about implementing crazy lock-free schemes, it’s about maintaining application state and sanity in the multithreaded world.
The bulk of the compiler is symbolic manipulation, arguably best suited for lisp.
Picking a VM-based language for such task (for example, OCaml), doesn’t have any intrinsic downsides.</p>
<p>At the same time, the task is pretty complex and unique.
The ratio of “your code” vs “framework code” when implementing features is much higher than in a typical CRUD backend.</p>
<p>Now that the projects are introduced, lets take two roughly equivalent slices of history.</p>

<p>Both are about 2 years old, with 1-1.5 developers working full time and vibrant and thriving community of open-source contributors.
There are 52k lines of Kotlin and 66k lines of Rust.</p>
<p>Both delivered roughly equivalent feature sets at that time.
To be honest, I still don’t really believe this :)
rust-analyzer started from zero, it didn’t have a decade worth of Java classes to bootstrap from, and the productivity drop between Kotlin and Rust is supposed to be huge.
But it’s hard to argue with reality.
Instead, let me try to reflect on my experience building both, and to try to explain Rust’s surprising productivity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_learning_curve">Learning Curve</h2>
<div>
<p>It’s easy to characterize Kotlin’s learning curve — it is nearly zero.
I’ve started IntelliJ Rust without Kotlin experience and never felt that I need to specifically learn Kotlin.</p>
<p>When I switched to rust-analyzer, I was pretty experienced with Rust.
I would say that one definitely needs to deliberately learn Rust, it’s hard to pick it up on the go.
Ownership and aliasing control are novel concepts (even if you come from C++), and taking holistic approach to learning them pays off.
After the initial learning step the ride is generally smooth.</p>
<p>By the way, this is the perfect place to plug our Rust courses and tailor-made <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/">trainings</a> :-)
The next <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/training/#package-intro-training">introduction to Rust</a> is happening this December!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_modularity">Modularity</h2>
<div>
<p>This I think is the biggest factor.
Both projects are moderately large in terms of scope as well as in terms of amount of source code.
I believe that the only way to ship big things is to split them in independent-ish chunks and implement the chunks separately.</p>
<p>I also find most of the languages I am familiar with to be pretty horrible with respect to modularity.
More generally, I am amused with FP vs OO debate, as it seems that “why no one does modules right?” is a more salient issue.</p>
<p>Rust is one of the few languages which has first-class concept of libraries.
Rust code is organized on two levels:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>as a tree of inter-dependent modules inside a crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as a directed acyclic graph of crates</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Cyclic dependencies are allowed between the modules, but not between the crates.
Crates are units of reuse and privacy: only crate’s public API matters, and it is crystal clear what crate’s public API is.
Moreover, crates are anonymous, so you don’t get name conflicts and dependency hell when mixing several versions of the same crate in a single crate graph.</p>
<p>This makes it very easy to make two pieces of code <strong>not</strong> depend on each other (non-dependencies are the essence of modularity): just put them in separate crates.
During code review, only changes to Cargo.tomls need to be monitored carefully.</p>
<p>At the time of comparison, rust-analyzer is split into 23 internal crates, with a handful general-purposed ones released on crates.io.
In contrast, IntelliJ Rust is a single Kotlin module, where everything can depend on everything else.
Although internal organization of IntelliJ Rust is pretty clean, it’s not reflected in the file system layout and build system, and needs constant maintenance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_build_system">Build System</h2>
<div>
<p>Managing project’s build takes significant amount of times, and has multiplicative effect on everything else.</p>
<p>Rust’s build system, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a>, is very good.
It’s not perfect, but it is a breath of fresh air after Java’s <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>.</p>
<p>Cargo’s trick is that it doesn’t try to be a general purpose build system.
It can only build Rust projects, and it has rigid expectation about the project structure.
It’s impossible to opt out of the core assumptions.
Configuration is a static non-extensible TOML file.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gradle allows free-form project structure, and is configured via a Turing complete language.
I feel like I’ve spend more time learning Gradle than learning Rust!
Running <code>wc -w</code> gives 182_817 words for Rust book, and 280_506 for Gradle’s user guide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cargo is just faster than Gradle in most cases.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest downside is that custom build logic is not expressible in Cargo.
Both projects needs substantial amount of logic beyond mere compilation to deliver the final result to the user.
For rust-analyzer, this is handled by hand-written Rust script, which works perfectly at this scale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<div>
<p>Language-level support for libraries and top-notch build system/package manager allow for a thriving ecosystem.
rust-analyzer relies on third-party libraries much more than IntelliJ Rust.
Some parts of rust-analyzer are also published to crates.io for other projects to reuse.</p>
<p>Additionally, low-level nature of the Rust programming language often allows for “perfect” library interfaces.
Interfaces which exactly reflect the underlying problem, without imposing intermediate language-level abstractions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_basic_conveniences">Basic Conveniences</h2>
<div>
<p>I feel that Rust is significantly more productive when it comes to basic language nuts and bolts — structs, enums, functions, etc.
This is not specific to Rust — any ML-family language has them.
However, Rust is the first industrial language which wraps these features in a nice package, not constrained by backwards compatibility.
I want to list specific features which I think allow producing maintainable code faster in Rust</p>
<p><em>Emphasis on data over behavior</em>.
Aka, Rust is not an OOP language.
The core idea of OOP is that of dynamic dispatch — which code is invoked by a function call is decided at runtime (late binding).
This is a powerful pattern which allows for flexible and extensible system.
The problem is, extensibility is costly!
It’s better only to apply it in certain designated areas.
Designing for extensibility by default is not cost effective.
Rust puts static dispatch front and center: it is mostly clear whats going on by just reading the code, as it is independent of runtime types of the objects.</p>
<p>One small syntactic thing I enjoy about Rust is how it puts fields and methods into different blocks syntactically:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>first_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
  <span>last_name</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>full_name</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>...</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to see at a glance all the fields makes understanding the code much simpler.
Fields convey much more information than methods.</p>
<p><em>Sum types</em>.
Rust’s humbly named enums are full algebraic data types.
This means that you can express the idea of disjoint union:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum</span> <span>Either</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>A</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>),</span> <span>B</span><span>(</span><span>B</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is hugely useful in day-to-day programming in the small, and some times during programming in the large as well.
To give one example, one of the core concepts for an IDE are references and definitions.
A definition a like <code>let foo = 92;</code> assigns a name to an entity which can be used down a line.
A reference like <code>foo + 90</code> <em>refers</em> to some definition.
When you ctrl-click on reference, you go to the definition.</p>
<p>Natural way to model that in Kotlin is by adding <code>interface Definition</code> and <code>interface Reference</code>.
The problem is, some things are …</p></div></div></div></div>

    <p>
  <strong>Vega-Lite</strong> is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.
</p>

<p><span>
  <span>
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to <strong>properties of graphical marks</strong> (e.g., points or bars).
    The Vega-Lite compiler <strong>automatically produces visualization components</strong> including axes, legends, and scales.
    It determines default properties of these components based on a set of <strong>carefully designed rules</strong>.
    This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization.
    As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both <strong>data transformations</strong> (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and <strong>visual transformations</strong> (e.g., stacking and faceting).
    Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be <strong>composed</strong> into layered and multi-view displays, and made <strong>interactive with selections</strong>.

  </span>
</span></p>

<p>Compared to <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega">Vega</a>, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the <em>primary</em> visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.</p>

<p>Zoom recently announced that they were going to make end-to-end encryption available to all of their users–not just customers.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a good move, especially for people living in countries with <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/02/how-and-why-america-was-hit-so-hard-by-covid-19/">inept leadership that failed to address the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and therefore need to conduct their work and schooling remotely through software like Zoom. I enthusiastically applaud them for making this change.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1333" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-08/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-08" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-08.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>End-to-end encryption, on by default, is a huge win for everyone who uses Zoom. (Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/lynxvsjackalope">Khia</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The end-to-end encryption capability arrives on the heels of their acquisition of <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> in earlier this year. Hiring a team of security experts and cryptography engineers seems like a good move overall.</p>



<p>Upon hearing this news, I decided to be a good neighbor and take a look at their source code, with the reasoning, “If so many people’s privacy is going to be dependent on Zoom’s security, I might as well make sure they’re not doing something ridiculously bad.”</p>



<p>Except I couldn’t find their source code anywhere online. But they did publish <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper">a white paper on Github</a>…</p>







<h2>Disclaimers</h2>



<p>What follows is the opinion of some guy on the Internet with a fursona–so whether or not you choose to take it seriously should be informed by this context. It is not the opinion of anyone’s employer, nor is it endorsed by Zoom, etc. Tell your lawyers to calm their nips.</p>



<p>More importantly, I’m not here to hate on Zoom for doing a good thing, nor on the security experts that worked hard on making Zoom better for their users. The responsibility of security professionals is to the users, after all.</p>



<p>Also, these aren’t zero-days, so don’t try to lecture me about “responsible” disclosure. (That term is also <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2015/11/19/responsible-disclosure-is-wrong/">problematic</a>, by the way.)</p>



<p>Got it? Good. Let’s move on.</p>







<h2>Bizarre Design Choices in Version 2.3 of Zoom’s E2E White Paper</h2>



<p>Note: I’ve altered the screenshots to be white text on a black background, since my blog’s color scheme is darker than a typical academic PDF. You can find the source <a href="https://github.com/zoom/zoom-e2e-whitepaper/blob/d3be2a5a3e16be04f1199b92630f180ba79cb51c/zoom_e2e.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1744" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-02/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png" data-orig-size="784,652" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-02.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>It’s a little weird that they’re calculating a signature over SHA256(Context) || SHA256(M), considering Ed25519 uses SHA512 internally.</p>



<p>It would make just as much sense to sign Context || M directly–or, if pre-hashing large streams is needed, SHA512(Context || M).</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1740" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-01/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png" data-orig-size="1039,788" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-01.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>At the top of this section, it says it uses libsodium’s <code>crypto_box</code> interface. But then they go onto… not actually use it.</p>



<p>Instead, they wrote their own protocol using HKDF, two SHA256 hashes, and XChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>



<p>While secure, this isn’t <em>really</em> using the crypto_box interface.</p>



<p>The only part of the libsodium interface that’s being used is <code><a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/927dfe8e2eaa86160d3ba12a7e3258fbc322909c/src/libsodium/crypto_box/curve25519xsalsa20poly1305/box_curve25519xsalsa20poly1305.c#L35-L46">crypto_box_beforenm()</a></code>, which could easily have been a call to <code>crypto_scalarmult()</code>instead (since they’re passing the output of the scalar multiplication to HKDF anyway).</p>







<p>Also, the SHA256(a) || SHA256(b) pattern returns. Zoom’s engineers must love SHA256 for some reason.</p>



<p>This time, it’s in the additional associated data for the XChaCha20-Poly1305. </p>



<p>Binding the ciphertext and the signature to the same context string is a sensible thing to do, it’s just the concatenation of SHA256 hashes is a bit weird when SHA512 exists.</p>



<h3>Meeting Leader Security Code</h3>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1746" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-03/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" data-orig-size="760,733" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-03" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-03.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Here we see Zoom using the a SHA256 of a constant string (“<code>Zoombase-1-ClientOnly-MAC-SecurityCode</code>“) in a construction that tries but fails to be HMAC.</p>



<p>And then they concatenate it with the SHA256 hash of the public key (which is already a 256-bit value), and then they hash the whole thing again.</p>



<p>It’s redundant SHA256 all the way down. The redundancy of “MAC” and “SecurityCode” in their constant string is, at least, consistent with the rest of their design philosophy.</p>



<p>It would be a real shame if double-hashing carried the risk of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/382">invalidating security proofs</a>, or if <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/kmd5.pdf">the security proof for HMAC</a> required a high Hamming distance of padding constants and this design decision also later <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/684.pdf">saved HMAC from related-key attacks</a>.</p>



<h3>Hiding Personal Details</h3>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1750" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/zoom-e2e-04/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png" data-orig-size="739,603" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom-e2e-04" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=580" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=739" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png 739w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/zoom-e2e-04.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px"></figure>



<p>Wait, you’re telling me Zoom was aware of HMAC’s existence this whole time?</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1202" data-permalink="https://soatok.blog/soatoktelegrams2020-02/" data-orig-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png" data-orig-size="512,512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SoatokTelegrams2020-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=512" src="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=512" alt="" srcset="https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png 512w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=150 150w, https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/soatoktelegrams2020-02.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>I give up!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Enough Pointless Dunking, What’s the Takeaway?</h2>



<p>None of the design decisions Zoom made that I’ve criticized here are security vulnerabilities, but they do demonstrate an early lack of cryptography expertise in their product design.</p>



<p>After all, the weirdness is almost entirely contained in section 3 of their white paper, which describes the “Phase I” of their rollout. So what I’ve pointed out here appears to be mostly legacy cruft that wasn’t risky enough to bother changing in their final design.</p>



<p>The rest of their paper is pretty straightforward and pleasant to read. Their design makes sense in general, and each phase includes an “Areas to Improve” section.</p>



<p>All in all, if you’re worried about the security of Zoom’s E2EE feature, the only thing they can really do better is to publish the source code (and link to it from the whitepaper repository for ease-of-discovery) for this feature so independent experts can publicly review it.</p>



<p>However, they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of the experts on their payroll, so I wouldn’t count on that happening.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>

If you're, for example, contributing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">reddit</a> thread about something which is irrelevant or anything with only a short-term relevance, this article does not apply to you right now.

</p>

<p>

However, as soon as you're helping somebody solving an interesting issue, summarize your experiences with something or write anything that might be cool to be around in a couple of years as well, you do provide potential high-value content. My message to all those authors is: <b>don't use web-based forums</b>.

</p>

<p>

TL;DR: all of the content of closed, centralized services will be lost in the long run. Choose the platform you contribute to wisely now instead of learning through more large data loss events later-on.

</p>

<p>

The longer version is worth your time:

</p>

	  <header><h2>What Do I Mean With Web-Based Forums Here?</h2></header>

<p>

In this article, I'm using the term "web-based forums" as an umbrella term for closed, centralized services like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot">Slashdot</a>, Facebook, or any other web-based forum where you are able to add comments, articles, and so forth in most cases only after creating an account.

</p>

<p>

Typically, those services don't provide any possibility to extract or synchronize content. They don't offer open APIs that allow users to choose among different and open user interfaces. They are owned and operated by private companies.

</p>

<p>

Please note that when I'm going to mention more or less only reddit as an example in the next sections, this is because reddit is the only web-based forum <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/publicvoit">I'm familiar with</a> to a certain level. This does not mean that reddit is worse than other closed, centralized web-based forums. Not at all.

</p>

	  <header><h2>So What's the Issue With Web-Based Forums?</h2></header>

<p>

There is not one issue. There are several things where web-based forums don't qualify for being a platform for quality content. Let's take a look at some of them.

</p>

<p>

I'm glad you're still reading this article and I hope you bear with me until the end of it. Most people will realize and learn about having contributed lots and lots of high-value information only when platforms are down for good. And this is what makes me really sad. It is just like you know that one building of the Library of Alexandria is going to burn down in a few years and people still bring many unique copies of high-quality books into its shelves, unaware of destroying knowledge this way.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Issue: No Backup, No Distribution</h3></header>

<p>

For reasons and examples stated <a href="https://karl-voit.at/cloud">in this article</a>, any centralized web-based service will go offline some day. Some sooner, some later. Popularity is not even a guarantee that a service gets continued, as you can see with <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">hundreds of (partly) very well known and used Google services that were shut down</a>. Nothing will be on the web forever. Most people are not aware of this fact. The books set on this machine are more likely to survive history than all of your reddit/Facebook/... contributions:

</figure>

<p>

So when you begin to be aware of this fact, you might want to think of things you can do to mitigate data loss when services are discontinued or "sunrized" as some marketing experts say.

</p>

<p>

You could, for example, back-up the data of this service. By providing the information on multiple servers, chances are high that not all of them are lost at the same time.

</p>

<p>

This requires certain properties. For example, you need to be able to duplicate the service on multiple servers. To be able to do so, you'll need not only the data but also the software that is providing access to the service. When different organization are running mirrored servers, it is required to openly share the data and software. This can be ensured by using Open Source software or at least open APIs and a business model that does not rely on keeping data and technical things a secret.

</p>

<p>

All major commercial services such as reddit, Facebook and so forth keep everything a secret that is not ultimately necessary to use their services. Their software is a secret, they don't offer open APIs or only very crippled ones, you don't have the possibility to get to the raw data. So no luck there. You do have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">a lock-in situation</a>.

</p>

<figcaption>https://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>

Even with personal blogs, "fragile" as they are, you are able to use the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine of the Internet Archive</a> to back up your blog. For example, every page on my blog contains a link to its archive in the page footer. This ensures that you can not only browse the latest version of all of my blog articles in case of a server breakdown. This also enables you to browse all previous version, probably changed over time. Go ahead, try a few "Archive" links of my articles. If any of my articles start with an "Updates:" section, you know for sure that there are older versions accessible via the Internet Archive.

</p>

<p>

The Wayback Machine does not archive reddit threads. It can not properly back up Facebook pages. <a href="https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360004651732-Using-The-Wayback-Machine">It's blinded by corporate secrecy</a> when it comes to archive content for the upcoming generations:

</p>

<blockquote>Why isn't the site I'm looking for in the archive?<br>
Some sites may not be included because the automated crawlers were
unaware of their existence at the time of the crawl. It's also
possible that some sites were not archived because they were password
protected, blocked by robots.txt, or otherwise inaccessible to our
automated systems. Site owners might have also requested that their
sites be excluded from the Wayback Machine.</blockquote>

<p>

Summarizing the things mentioned above: without very good support for data export, service duplication, open standards, any content you provide in closed web-based services will be lost just as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/business/myspace-user-data.html">MySpace already lost twelve years of content just so</a>, just to mention one big example.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Issue: User Interface Dictatorship</h3></header>

<p>

When you grew up only knowing centralized web-based forums, you can not imagine the many advantages of having the freedom to choose your preferred user interface. While some people might think this is a minor issue, let me explain a few examples where this makes a huge difference.

</p>

<p>

The first example starts with something that might only annoy people. With comments like on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/hfamm7/those_who_have_tried_out_multiple_zettelkasten/fvx9vu5/">this thread</a>, you clutter up other people's interface for personal gain. It's selfish and distracts from the information consumption.

</p>

<p>

The reason why people are using such reminder bots is multi-fold. First, they don't use a proper todo management system that would be able to remind them to read a certain article in a few days. They externalize this inability to the web-based forum and all of its other users. <a href="https://karl-voit.at/tags/pim">I'm working on fixing these educational issues</a>. Secondly, there is no way to have features that you can use that do not affect other people's interface.

</p>

<p>

Consider people with visual impairment do have special needs. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6ncgvjt">The WHO reports</a> an estimate of 285 million people that do are visually impaired, ninety percent of them living in developing countries. Those are not numbers you can simply ignore. It is obvious that they do need different kind of interfaces. Either they have to use a high-contrast interface, highly unusual interface scaling factors, an interface that avoids certain color combinations, text-to-speech systems or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille#Braille_reading">Braille readers</a> that are able to extract the content properly.

</p>

<p>

If a web-based services that - remember from before - does not offer proper open APIs and which does not implement said features, all those people simply can not participate and you can not profit from their knowledge and experience.

</p>

<p>

And even when you think that this is just a minority I can provide examples where everybody profits from choosing his or her own interface.

</p>

<p>

Some services are providing interfaces that aren't working properly on small displays or mobile devices in general. In these cases, without any ability to switch to an alternative app or web-page, you are locked out even with perfect eyesight.

</p>

<p>

When you're using an web-based forum that does not provide the feature that already read articles are marked or collapsed, you need to skim though a thread completely and re-read content to find out new postings when re-visiting the thread after a while. Our time should not spent on senseless tasks like this.

</p>

<p>

Alternative interfaces might provide advanced rating features based on your personal taste and choice so that you are able to filter out the most relevant articles easily and do not clutter your view with irrelevant articles at all. This is also called "scoring". It can be based on keywords, the amount of personal contributions to a longer thread, friendship relationships from your contact management, and so forth.

</p>

<p>

Some people prefer navigating using the keyboard. Either by personal taste or by physical restrictions. If the web-based centralized service only supports mouse-based navigation, you can not use this service.

</p>

<p>

I could continue with examples like that. The common theme is: when one particular centralized web-based forum is not implementing all of those nice features you need or like, you can not use them properly.

</p>

	  <header><h3>Issue: Rule Monopoly and Subjective Censorship</h3></header>

<p>

When you do live in a society with certain set of (legal) rules, providers of relevant web-based forums have to follow and enforce some of them. However, the issue is that this kind of censorship is and will always be related to a particular culture and society at a specific time.

</p>

<p>

For example, in Germany and Austria, being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">Nazi</a> is punishable by law. In the USA, freedom-loving people think fans of the human monsters that tortured and murdered millions of Jews in the Second World War need the possibility to express their personal "opinion". As you can see, there is a different point of view in-between the lines when I write about Nazis compared to an author from the USA who values "freedom of speech" higher than "being a die-hard fan of mass murders". It's a very difficult topic you can not enforce with a world-wide service.

of biometric data, which is a unique and permanent characteristic of our body and a key to our identity."</p>  <p>According to the report, the technology&nbsp;Cadillac Fairview used&nbsp;— known as

malls.</p>  <p>Cadillac Fairview said it&nbsp;used AVA technology&nbsp;to assess foot traffic and track shoppers' ages and genders&nbsp;— but not to identify individuals.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The company

standard for meaningful consent.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"An individual would not, while using a mall directory, reasonably expect their image to be captured and used to create a biometric representation of their face, which is sensitive personal information, or for that biometric information to be used to guess their approximate age and gender," they wrote.</p>  <p>The privacy watchdogs also took issue with the way the&nbsp;five&nbsp;million images were stored.</p>  <p>Cadillac Fairview&nbsp;said the&nbsp;images taken by camera were briefly analyzed then deleted&nbsp;—&nbsp;but investigators found that the sensitive biometric information generated from the images was being stored in a centralized database by&nbsp;a third-party company,</p>  <p>"Our investigation revealed that&nbsp;[Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited's]&nbsp;AVA&nbsp;service provider had collected and stored approximately five million numerical representations of faces on&nbsp;CFCL's behalf, on a decommissioned server, for no apparent purpose and with no justification," notes the investigation.</p>  <p>"Cadillac Fairview stated that it was unaware that the database of biometric information existed, which compounded the risk of potential use by unauthorized parties or, in the case of a data breach, by malicious actors."</p>  <h2>Company&nbsp;says technology couldn't identify people</h2>  <p>The company said the technology was used&nbsp;to detect the presence of a human face and&nbsp;assign it&nbsp;"within milliseconds"&nbsp;to an approximate age and gender category and maintains it&nbsp;did not store any images during the pilot program and was not capable of recognizing anyone.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt=""

Otherwise, why are the customers going to continue shopping there?"</p>  <p>B.C. Information and Privacy Commissioner&nbsp;Michael McEvoy&nbsp;said&nbsp;the fact he and his counterparts can't issue a fine in a&nbsp;case like this should make the case for stronger powers at both the federal and provincial levels.</p>  <p>"Fines in a case like this would have been a consideration. It is an incredible shortcoming of Canadian law," he said.</p>  <p>"We as privacy regulators don't have any authority to levy fines on companies that violate peoples'&nbsp;personal information and that should really change."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

October 29, 2020 | https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/introducing-semgrep-and-r2c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/introducing-semgrep-and-r2c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p>Free, fast, <a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source</a>, offline, customizable. These are not often words that describe code scanning tools, and that's a shame.</p>
<p>We founded r2c to bring world-class security tools to developers based on our conviction that software will run the most exciting parts of the future: everything from medical equipment to robots to autonomous cars. The security process should not be the foe but rather the enabler of rapid software development. If developers lack tooling that is easy to set up and understand—or if a developer has to convince their manager to spend a few million dollars on advanced security tools each time they change jobs, the future is bleak.</p>
<p>Before founding r2c, we worked on security and developer tools for large companies and governments. It was eye-opening to see that despite massive budgets, their security programs were generally a generation or more behind the tech giants. When it came to security tools for developers, most teams were jaded about scanning code for vulnerabilities; they hated the tools they had to use and usually ignored them beyond doing the minimum necessary to satisfy a compliance checkbox.</p>
<p>What about code scanning at places like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google? They don't generally use traditional commercial security tools which ask "how can we find every bug?" Instead, they focus on custom tooling that can build guardrails for developers. This doesn't require million-dollar tools, PhDs in program analysis, or days of compute time. It looks much more like unit tests for security.</p>
<p>We believe there is a gap between traditional compliance tools and simple linters that's ripe for a new approach, and we were fortunate to find partners from Redpoint Ventures and Sequoia Capital who agreed. With them, we raised a $13M Series A round of funding to build a security tool that developers might actually love. We've been working on it quietly for a while now, and we're finally ready to announce it to the world!</p>
<h2>Semgrep</h2>
<p><a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep</a>, our open-source product, is specifically designed for eradicating bug classes.
Developers and security engineers can say "this is the safe pattern we always use for (e.g. parsing XML)", write a rule in a few minutes, and enforce that on every editor save, commit, and pull request.</p>
<p>Semgrep is ideal for building security guardrails: start by using frameworks designed with security in mind, then automatically flag code that strays from the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure-by-default path</a>. This is an approach used by <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/resources/foundationsandprinciples/srs-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/01/designing-security-for-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/continuous-compliance-ase2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, Dropbox, Stripe, <a href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/scaling-appsec-at-netflix-6a13d7ab6043" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix</a>, and others—a topic <a href="https://events.bizzabo.com/OWASPGlobalAppSec/agenda/session/315858" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clint Gibler and I presented on at Global AppSec 2020</a>. This approach increases developer productivity, reduces attack surface, minimizes the areas for human inspection and audit, and allows the security team to scalably protect code written by thousands of developers.</p>
<p>The idea behind Semgrep is simple: it feels like a regular search (grep) but is syntax-aware. You can <a href="https://semgrep.dev/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn Semgrep</a> in a few minutes! And Semgrep can be used for <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than just security</a> issues: performance, internationalization, or just annoyances <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed by accident</a>.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>Semgrep started as an open-source project at Facebook and we're lucky to have its original author, Yoann Padioleau, on our team at r2c. Since we released the first post-Facebook version (0.4) earlier this year, we've released 25 new versions, added support for 8 new languages, reworked the parsers so we could collaborate with Github on <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree-sitter</a>, been joined by thousands of enthusiastic GitHub followers, and seen over 100K pulls of the Semgrep Docker image.</p>
<p>Our roadmap contains more program analysis features to support the sorts of secure-by-default enforcement that large technology companies are already leveraging so heavily (constant propagation, taint tracking, and more), as well as support for many more languages.</p>
<h2>Batteries Included</h2>
<p>Along with this release of Semgrep, we're announcing the availability of <a href="https://semgrep.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep Community</a>, a free, hosted service for managing Semgrep CI as well as Semgrep Teams, a paid service which adds additional features for managing Semgrep that are useful for enterprises. Both these offerrings provide SaaS infrastructure for operating a modern AppSec program. They enable central definition of code standards for your projects and show results where you already work: GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Jira, VS Code, and more.</p>
<p>We're also excited that <a href="https://semgrep.dev/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semgrep Registry</a> already has 900+ rules written by r2c and the community—you can start running on your project right now! Or if you like to DIY, <a href="https://semgrep.dev/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try writing your own</a>.</p></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

<em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-10/">previous</a></em>
</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the Compiling a Lisp series. Last time, we learned about Intel
instruction encoding. This time, we’re going to use that knowledge to compile
procedure calls.</p>

<p>The usual function expression in Lisp is a <code>lambda</code> — an anonymous function
that can take arguments and close over variables. Procedure calls are <em>not</em>
this. They are simpler constructs that just take arguments and return values.</p>

<p>We’re adding procedure calls first as a stepping stone to full closure support.
This will help us get some kind of internal calling convention established and
stack manipulation figured out before things get too complicated.</p>

<p>After this post, we will be able to support programs like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>labels</span> <span>((</span><span>add</span> <span>(</span><span>code</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sub</span> <span>(</span><span>code</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>y</span><span>))))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>sub</span> <span>4</span> <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>add</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>)))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and even this snazzy factorial function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>labels</span> <span>((</span><span>factorial</span> <span>(</span><span>code</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> 
            <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span> <span>x</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>x</span> <span>1</span><span>)))))))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>labelcall</span> <span>factorial</span> <span>5</span><span>))</span>
<span>; =&gt; 120</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are fairly pedestrian snippets of code but they demonstrate some new
features we are adding, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new <code>labels</code> form that all programs will now have to look like</li>
  <li>A new <code>code</code> form for describing procedures and their parameters</li>
  <li>A new <code>labelcall</code> expression for calling procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>Ghuloum does not explain why he does this, but I imagine that the <code>labels</code> form
was chosen over allowing multiple separate top-level bindings because it is
easier to parse and traverse.</p>

<h3 id="big-ideas">Big ideas</h3>

<p>In order to compile a program, we are going to traverse every binding in the
<code>labels</code>. For each binding, we will generate code for each <code>code</code> object.</p>

<p>Compiling <code>code</code> objects requires making an environment for their parameters.
We’ll establish a calling convention later so that our compiler knows where to
find the parameters.</p>

<p>Then, once we’ve emitted all the code for the bindings, we will compile the
body. The body may, but is not required to, contain a <code>labelcall</code> expression.</p>

<p>In order to compile a <code>labelcall</code> expression, we will compile all of the
arguments provided, save them in consecutive locations on the stack, and then
emit a <code>call</code> instruction.</p>

<p>When all of these pieces come together, the resulting machine code will look
something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mov rsi, rdi  # prologue
label0:
  label0_code
label1:
  label1_code
main:
  main_code
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see that all of the <code>code</code> objects will be compiled in sequence,
followed by the body of the <code>labels</code> form.</p>

<s>
Because I have not yet figured out how to start executing at somewhere other
than the beginning of the generated code, and because I don't store generated
code in any intermediate buffers, and because we don't know the sizes of any
code in advance, I do this funky thing where I emit a `jmp` to the body code.

If you, dear reader, have a better solution, please let me know.
</s>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>jsmith45</em> gave me the encouragement I needed to work on this again.
It turns out that storing the code offset of the beginning of the <code>main_code</code>
(the <code>labels</code> body) adding that to the <code>buf-&gt;address</code> works just fine. I’ll
explain more below.</p>

<h3 id="a-calling-convention">A calling convention</h3>

<p>We’re not going to use the System V AMD64 ABI. That calling convention requires
that parameters are passed first in certain registers, and then on the stack.
Instead, we will pass all parameters on the stack.</p>

<p>This makes our code simpler, but it also means that at some point later on, we
will have to add a different kind of calling convention so that we can call
foreign functions (like <code>printf</code>, or <code>exit</code>, or something). Those functions
expect their parameters in registers. We’ll worry about that later.</p>

<p>If we borrow and adapt the excellent diagrams from the Ghuloum tutorial, this
means that right before we make a procedure call, our stack will look like
this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stack illustration courtesy of <a href="https://leonardschuetz.ch/">Leonard</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see the first return point at <code>[rsp]</code>. This is the return point placed
by the caller of the <em>current</em> function.</p>

<p>Above that are whatever local variables we have declared with <code>let</code> or perhaps
are intermediate values from some computation.</p>

<p>Above that is a blank space reserved for the second return point. This is the
return point for the <em>about-to-be-called</em> function. The <code>call</code> instruction will
fill in after evaluating all the arguments.</p>

<p>Above the return point are all the outgoing arguments. They will appear as
locals for the procedure being called.</p>

<p>Finally, above the arguments, is untouched free stack space.</p>

<p>The <code>call</code> instruction decrements <code>rsp</code> and then writes to <code>[rsp]</code>. This means
that if we just emitted a <code>call</code>, the first local would be overwritten. No
good. Worse, the way the stack would be laid out would mean that the locals
would look like arguments.</p>

<p>In order to solve this problem, we need to first adjust <code>rsp</code> to point to the
last local. That way the decrement will move it below the local and the return
address will go between the locals and the arguments.</p>

<p>After the <code>call</code> instruction, the stack will look different. Nothing will have
actually changed, except for <code>rsp</code>. This change to <code>rsp</code> means that the callee
has a different view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stack illustration courtesy of <a href="https://leonardschuetz.ch/">Leonard</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The empty colored in spaces below the return point indicate that the values on
the stack are “hidden” from view, since they are above (higher addresses than)
<code>[rsp]</code>. The called function will <em>not</em> be able to access those values.</p>

<p>If the called function wants to use one of its arguments, it can pull it off
the stack from its designated location.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One unfortunate consequence of this calling convention is that Valgrind does
not understand it. Valgrind cannot understand that the caller has placed data
on the stack specifically for the callee to read it, and thinks this is a
move/jump of an uninitialized value. This means that we get some errors now
on these labelcall tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, when the function returns, the <code>ret</code> instruction will pop the
return point off the stack and jump to it. This will bring us back to the
previous call frame.</p>

<p>That’s that! I have yet to find a good tool that will let me visualize the
stack as a program is executing. GDB probably has a mode hidden away somewhere
undocumented that does exactly this. Cutter sort of does, but it’s finicky in
ways I don’t really understand. Maybe one day <a href="http://akkartik.name/">Kartik</a>’s
x86-64 Mu fork will be able to do this.</p>

<h3 id="building-procedure-calls-in-small-pieces">Building procedure calls in small pieces</h3>

<p>In order for this set of changes to make sense, I am going to explain all of
the pieces one at a time, top-down.</p>

<p>First, we’ll look at the new-and-improved <code>Compile_entry</code>, which has been
updated to handle the <code>labels</code> form. This will do the usual Lisp entrypoint
setup and some checks about the structure of the AST.</p>

<p>Then, we’ll actually look at compiling the <code>labels</code>. This means going through
the bindings one-by-one and compiling their <code>code</code> objects.</p>

<p>Then, we’ll look at what it means to compile a <code>code</code> object. Hint: it’s very
much like <code>let</code>.</p>

<p>Last, we’ll tie it all together when compiling the body of the <code>labels</code> form.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-the-entrypoint">Compiling the entrypoint</h3>

<p>Most of this code is checking. What used to just compile an expression now
validates that what we’ve passed in at least vaguely looks like a well-formed
<code>labels</code> form before picking it into its component parts: the <code>bindings</code> and
the <code>body</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_entry</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>Compile_entry</code> dispatches to <code>Compile_labels</code> for iterating over all of the
labels. <code>Compile_labels</code> is a recursive function that keeps track of all the
labels so far in its arguments, so we start it off with an empty <code>labels</code>
environment.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-labels">Compiling labels</h3>

<p>In <code>Compile_labels</code>, we have first a base case: if there are no labels we
should just emit the body.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_labels</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>bindings</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>body</span><span>,</span>

    <span>// Base case: no bindings. Compile the body</span>
    <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kEntryPrologue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kEntryPrologue</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also set the buffer entrypoint location to the position where we’re going to
emit the body of the <code>labels</code>. We’ll use this later when executing, or later in
the series when we emit ELF binaries. You’ll have to add a field <code>word
entrypoint</code> to your <code>Buffer</code> struct.</p>

<p>We pass in an empty <code>varenv</code>, since we are not accumulating any locals along
the way; only labels. For the same reason, we give a <code>stack_index</code> of
<code>-kWordSize</code> — the first slot.</p>

<p>If we <em>do</em> have labels, on the other hand, we should deal with the first label.
This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pulling out the name and the code object</li>
  <li>binding the name to the <code>code</code> location (the current location)</li>
  <li>compiling the <code>code</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And then from there we deal with the others recursively.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_labels</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>bindings</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>body</span><span>,</span>

<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-walkthrough/">Overview</a>: How Husky AI was built, threat modeled and operationalized</li>
<li><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2020/husky-ai-threat-modeling-machine-learning/">Attacks</a>: Some of the attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out</li>
</ul>
<p>A few weeks ago while preparing demos for my GrayHat 2020 - Red Team Village presentation I ran across “Image Scaling Attacks” in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-quiring.pdf">Adversarial Preprocessing: Understanding and Preventing Image-Scaling Attacks in Machine Learning</a> by Erwin Quiring, et al.</p>
<p>I thought that was so cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-image-scaling-attack">What is an image scaling attack?</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to hide a smaller image inside a larger image (it should be about 5-10x the size). The attack is easy to explain actually:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attacker crafts a malicious input image by hiding the desired target image inside a benign image</li>
<li>The image is loaded by the server</li>
<li>Pre-processing resizes the image</li>
<li>The server acts and makes decision based on a different image then intended</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to hide a husky image inside another image:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescale-attack.gif" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>Here are the two images I used - before and after the modification:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack-schoenbrunn.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the second image does have some strange dots all around. But this is not noticable when viewed in smaller version.</p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/EQuiw/2019-scalingattack">Github</a>. I used Google Colab to run it, and there were some errors initialy but it worked - let me know if interested and I can clean up and share the Notebook also.</p>
<h2 id="rescaling-and-magic-happens">Rescaling and magic happens!</h2>
<p>Now, look what happens when the image is loaded and resized with <code>OpenCV</code> using default settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2020/image-rescaling-attack.png" alt="Image Rescaling Attack"></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see the original sized image, and on the left the same image downsized to 128x128 pixels.</p>
<p><strong>That’s amazing!</strong></p>
<p>The downsized image is an entirely different picture now! Of course I picked a husky, since I wanted to attack “Husky AI” and find another bypass.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<p>This can have a set of implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Training process:</strong> Images that poisen the training data (as pre-processing rescales images)</li>
<li><strong>Model queries:</strong> The model might predict on a different image than the one the user uploaded</li>
<li><strong>Non ML related attacks:</strong> This can also be an issue in other, non machine learning areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess security never gets boring, there is always something new to learn.</p>
<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>
<p>Turns out that Husky AI uses PIL and that was not vulnerable to this attack by default.</p>
<p>I got lucky, because initially Husky AI did use <code>OpenCV</code> and it’s default settings to resize images. But for some reason I changed that early on (not knowing it would also mitigate this attack).</p>
<p>If you use <code>OpenCV</code> the issue can be fixed by using the <code>interpolation</code> argument when calling the <code>resize</code> API to not have it use the default.</p>
<p>Hope that was useful and interesting.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Johann.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Perhaps you've read posts like <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</a>
and <a href="http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time">Falsehoods programmers believe about time</a>.
Maybe you've also read <a href="http://wiesmann.codiferes.net/wordpress/?p=15187&amp;lang=en">Falsehoods programmers believe about geography</a>.</p>

<p>Addressing is a fertile ground for incorrect assumptions, because everyone's used to dealing with addresses and 99% of the time they seem so simple.
Below are some incorrect assumptions I've seen made, or made myself, or had reported to me.
(If you want to look up an address for a UK postcode or vice-versa to confirm what I'm telling you, try the <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/postcode-finder/">Royal Mail Postcode Finder</a>)</p>

<!-- Composition of building numbers -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there is a building number, it will be all-numeric.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p>

<p>4-5 Bonhill Street, London, EC2A 4BX</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No buildings are numbered zero</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at the very least no buildings have negative numbers</strong></p>

<p>Guy Chisholm provided this counterexample: Minusone Priory Road, Newbury, RG14 7QS</p>

<p>(none of the databases I've checked render this as -1)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We can put those funny numbers into the building name field, as no buildings have both a name and a funny number</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Idas Court, 4-6 Princes Road, Hull, HU5 2RD</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a building name, there won't be a building number (or vice-versa)</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building number will only be used once per street</strong></p>

<p>The difference between 50 Ammanford Road, Tycroes, Ammanford, SA18 3QJ and 50 Ammanford Road, Llandybie, Ammanford, SA18 3YF is about 4 miles (<a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=SA18+3QJ+to+SA18+3YF">Google Maps</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's line with a number in an address, it's the building number.</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: Flat 18, Da Vinci House, 44 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8FH, United Kingdom</p>

<p>You also get suite numbers, floor numbers, unit numbers, and organisations with numbers in their names.</p>

<p>Adrien Piérard contributes an address from Japan with fifteen digits in six separate numbers (five if you count the zip code as a single number). The format is: 980-0804 (zip code), Miyagi-ken (prefecture) Sendai-shi (city) Aoba-ku (ward) Kokubuncho (district) 4-10-20 (sub-district-number block-number lot-number) Sendai (building name) 401 (flat number).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, the first line starting with a number then</strong></p>

<p>Counterexample: 3 Store, 311-318 High Holborn, London, WC1V 7BN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building will only have one number</strong></p>

<p>Benton Lam offers this address from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - it has both a number on its road (14) and in its group of buildings (3): 15/F, Cityplaza 3, 14 TaiKoo Wan Road, Island East, HKSAR</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The number of buildings is the difference between the highest and lowest building numbers</strong></p>

<p>Tibor Schütz points out building numbers may be skipped - for example, on a street where even-numbered buildings are on one side, odd numbers on the other; multiple buildings sharing the same number (such as where a new house has been built) and buildings with more than one number.</p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov and Sami Lehtinen tell me in Antibes, France and rural Finland some buildings are numbered based on the distance from the start of the road - such as Longroad 65 for the building 750m from the start of longroad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If the addresses on the left of the road are even, the addresses on the right must be odd</strong></p>

<p>Cyrille Chépélov points out that in places, <a href="https://maps.google.fr/maps?q=48.857415,2.467167">Boulevard Théophile Sueur, Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France</a> has evens-only on both sides. The two sides are also in different cities and Départements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A building name won't also be a number</strong></p>

<p>Ben Tilly reports on Ten Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA - which is not, reportedly, the same as 10 Post Office Sq, Boston MA 02109 USA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Well, at least you can omit leading zeros</strong></p>

<p>Shaun Crampton reports living at 101 Alma St, Apartment 001, Palo Alto - where apartments 1 and 001 were on different floors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A street with a building A will not also have a building Alpha</strong></p>

<p>Douglas Perreault reports he lived in a block within a condo association; it was a large association, with blocks A through Z then Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. Mail and deliveries were often misrouted from block Alpha to block A and vice-versa. His address at the time was: 14100 N 46th St., Alpha 39, Tampa, FL 33613</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Composition of street names -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A street name won't include a number</strong></p>

<p>8 Seven Gardens Burgh, WOODBRIDGE, IP13 6SU (pointed out by Raphael Mankin)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but numbers in street names are expressed as words, not digits</strong></p>

<p>Jan Jongboom reports streets can be numbered in the Netherlands - for example, Plein 1944 in Nijmegen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a numbered street and a house number, there will be a separator between them</strong></p>

<p>Another from Jan Jongboom: Gondel 2695, Lelystad, means area Gondel, street 26, number 95</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names always end in descriptors like 'street', 'avenue', 'drive', 'square', 'hill' or 'view'</strong></p>

<p>They don't always - for example: Piccadilly, London, W1J 9PN</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor there will only be one</strong></p>

<p>A street name can be entirely descriptors: 17 Hill Street, London, W1J 5LJ or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Road">Avenue Road, Toronto, Ontario</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but when they do have a descriptor it will be at the end</strong></p>

<p>French addresses use prefix descriptors like 'rue', 'avenue', 'place' and 'allee'.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but if there's a descriptor it'll be at the start or end of the street name.</strong></p>

<p>Or the middle, like 3 Bishops Square Business Park, Hatfield, AL10 9NA</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK, but at the very least you wouldn't name a town Street</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Street,+Somerset">Actually there's a town called Street in Somerset, UK</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street numbers (and building numbers) don't contain fractions</strong></p>

<p>Dan, Fred Kroon, David Underwood and Daniel Dickison submitted examples of fractional street numbers like <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=43rd%20%C2%BD%20st,%20Pittsburgh,%20PA">43rd ½ St, Pittsburgh, PA</a>, and of fractional building numbers. These can be written in unicode (43rd ½ St), as a fraction with a slash (43 1/2) or as a decimal (43.5)</p>

<p>Gene Wirchenko reports a fractional building number: 1313 1/2 Railroad Ave Bellingham WA 98225-4729</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Street names don't recurr in the same city</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=from:W3+6LJ+to:W5+5DB+to:N8+7PB+to:SE25+6EP+to:E13+0AJ+to:E17+7LD+to:NW10+4LX+to:N1+9TR+to:E1+6PG+to:NW1+0JH+to:W14+8NL+to:SE13+6AD+to:SW19+5DX+to:E11+2AJ+to:SW19+2AE+to:E6+2HJ+&amp;saddr=W3+6LJ&amp;daddr=W5+5DB+to:N8+7PB+to:SE25+6EP+to:E13+0AJ+to:E17+7LD+to:NW10+4LX+to:N1+9TR+to:E1+6PG+to:NW1+0JH+to:W14+8NL+to:SE13+6AD+to:SW19+5DX+to:E11+2AJ+to:SW19+2AE+to:E6+2HJ">Here's a map of the following addresses:</a></p>

<ul>
<li>High Street, London, W3 6LJ</li>
<li>High Street, London, W5 5DB</li>
<li>High Street, London, N8 7PB</li>
<li>High Street, London, SE25 6EP</li>
<li>High Street, London, E13 0AJ</li>
<li>High Street, London, E17 7LD</li>
<li>High Street, London, NW10 4LX</li>
<li>Islington High Street, London, N1 9TR</li>
<li>Shoreditch High Street, London, E1 6PG</li>
<li>Camden High Street, London, NW1 0JH</li>
<li>Kensington High Street, London, W14 8NL</li>
<li>Lewisham High Street, London, SE13 6AD</li>
<li>High Street Wimbledon, London, SW19 5DX</li>
<li>High Street Wanstead, London, E11 2AJ</li>
<li>High Street Colliers Wood, London, SW19 2AE</li>
<li>High Street North, London, E6 2HJ </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>But street names don't recurr in close proximity</strong></p>

<p>Julian Fleischer provides an example from Bocholt in Germany showing several roads in close proximity all called <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=51.853945,6.615334">Up de Welle</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An address will be comprised of road names</strong></p>

<p>Kirk Kerekes spent several years using an address of the form "2 mi N then 3 mi W of Jennings, OK 74038" which regularly got successful deliveries. Mike Riley used to mail the Very Large Array radio telescope at "50 miles (80 km) West of Socorro, New Mexico, USA"</p>

<p>Sam pointed me to <a href="http://www.menomoneefallsnow.com/news/99857214.html">Menomonee Falls</a> where houses are addressed using Milwaukee County's grid system instead of house numbers - giving addresses like N88 W16541 Foobar St.</p>

<p>Andy Monat sent the following address example, from a <a href="http://ciapa.tulane.edu/uploads/1_EE_2012_Acceptance_Packet_INFORMATION-1340749206.pdf">semester abroad program at Tulane University </a>: CIAPA, 50 meters north of the Hypermas/Walmart of Curridabat, San Jose, Costa Rica. Adrien Piérard and Luke Allardyce point out street names are seldom used in Japan - instead, districts and blocks and lot numbers are used (more info on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">Wikipedia entry for the Japanese addressing system</a>).  A <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/592.cfm">2002 World Press Review report</a> gave this sample address: From where the Chinese restaurant used to be, two blocks down, half a block toward the lake, next door to the house where the yellow car is parked, Managua, Nicaragua. Shaun Crampton sent <a href="https://vianica.com/nicaragua/practical-info/14-addresses.html">an article with more details and examples of the Nicaraguan system</a>. Stig Brautaset pointed out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14806350">a BBC article about post in Kabul</a> gives this example: "Hamid Jaan, behind Darul-Aman palace". Nathan Fellman reports similar addressing is used in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.</p>

<p>Paul Puschmann and Tibor Schütz pointed out the city of <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratestadt">Mannheim in Germany is sometimes called Quadratestadt (City of Squares)</a> as the city centre is arranged in a grid, with blocks assigned a letter (along the north-south axis) and a number (along the east-west axis) then buildings numbered by block number. So an example address at numbers 6 to 13 on block R 5 would be: Institut für Deutsche Sprache, R 5, 6-13, D-68161 Mannheim </p>

<p>Leoni Lubbinge gives an example of a South African address: Part 84, Strydfontein 306 JR, Pretoria which means the 84th plot of the farm Strydfontein 306 JR.</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Elements being present or absent -->

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A road will have a name</strong></p>

<p>Plenty of roads like driveways, onramps and the aisles of carparks don't have names. Some roads in Japan also don't have names, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system">the prevalent addressing system works on districts, subdistricts, blocks, lots and lot numbers</a>.</p>

<p>Peter Kenway points out in America some homes are addressed as Rural Routes, where numbers are allocated to boxes on a route covering multiple roads. For example: Box 1234, R.R. 1, Winthrop, ME 04364.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A road will only have one name</strong></p>

<p>Many different roads, from Goswell Road in London to Regent Road in Edinburgh, make up the 410 mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_road_%28Great_Britain%29">A1</a>. And while there may only be one "1 Goswell Road" and only one "1 Regent Road" there are multiple buildings numbered 1 on the road designated A1.</p>

<p>Roads may also be named in multiple languages. For example, in Ireland roads may be named in both English and Irish</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Addresses will only have one street</strong></p>

<p>The Royal Mail have what they call a 'dependent street' - for example: 6 Elm Avenue, Runcorn Road, Birmingham, B12 8QX, United Kingdom (Runcorn Road is the street, Elm Avenue is the stubby 'dependent street' and isn't unique within the city. <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=B12+8QX">Google Maps</a> )</p>

<p>Another counterexample: Rogue Hair, 1 Hopton Parade, Streatham High Road, London, SW16 …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p><span>Written: 28 Oct 2020 by <i>Jeremy Howard</i></span></p><blockquote>
<p><em>Update Oct 20, 2020</em>: NumFOCUS <a href="https://numfocus.org/blog/jeremy-howard-apology">has apologized</a> to me. I accept their apology. I do not accept their assertion that “At the time of the interview, the committee had not determined that there was a violation of the code of conduct, only that there were two complaints filed and being examined.” The email to set up the call said “We would like to schedule a meeting so that we can discuss the results of our investigation with you” - nothing further. During the call, the committee stated the list of violations, and said “that is what the reporters stated, and what we found”. I asked why they didn’t take a statement from me before that finding, and they said “we all watched the video, so we could see for ourselves the violation”. The committee offered in their apology email to me to have a follow-up discussion, and I declined the offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: NumFOCUS found I violated their Code of Conduct (CoC) at JupyterCon because my talk was not “kind”, because I said Joel Grus was “wrong” regarding his opinion that Jupyter Notebook is not a good software development environment. Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a>”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I said that Joel Grus was “wrong”</li>
<li>I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</li>
<li>That I made “a negative reference” to his prior talk</li>
<li>I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996">diversity issues in the tech industry</a>, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience with the NumFOCUS code of conduct raises a few key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</li>
<li>There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</li>
<li>I was held to a different, undocumented and uncommunicated standard</li>
<li>The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</li>
<li>CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p>
<h3 id="my-talk-at-jupytercon">My talk at JupyterCon</h3>
<p>I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://jupytercon.com/">JupyterCon</a>. My partner Rachel gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frc7FgheUj4">talk at JupyterCon</a> a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">exploratory programming environment</a>, using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I Don’t Like Notebooks</a> which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p>
<p>Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time <em>not</em> to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/joel-order.png">
</figure>
<p>I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p>
<figure>
<img srcset="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png 2w" sizes="1px" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/numfocus/jeremy-order.png">
</figure>
<p>Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/1492041130">his book</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-code-of-conduct-violation-notice">The Code of Conduct violation notice</h3>
<p>A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p>
<p>The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a <a href="https://jupytercon.com/codeofconduct/">JupyterCon Code of Conduct</a>, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>. A link was also provided to <a href="https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT">report violations</a>, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p>
<p>I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct/response-and-enforcement-events-meetups">NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual</a>. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to …</p></div></div></div>
