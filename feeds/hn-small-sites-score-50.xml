        <section>
            <p>It’s been a while since we shared the story of an incident with you, and that’s probably a good thing –
most operational incidents we had in the past year were “boring” enough in nature to fix them easily.
This time, we’ve got a story of a data loss, caused by pure and simple human error – and the story of
how we recovered the data.</p>

<p>Even though it is quite embarrassing how the data loss happened, we think it’s worth sharing the story
of its recovery, as it might allow you to learn a few useful things in case you ever end up in a
similar situation.</p>

<p>As you might have seen, over the last 7 months we’ve extended our offerings beyond ticketing to allow
our customers to transform their events into the digital space as long as the global pandemic makes
traditional event formats impossible. The result of our effort is a joint venture called 
<a href="https://venueless.org/">Venueless</a> that you should absolutely check out if you haven’t yet.</p>

<p>One component of the virtual events we run on venueless is <strong>live video streaming</strong>. In this process,
our customers use a tool like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> or <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>
to create a live video stream. The stream is then sent to an <strong>encoding server</strong> of ours via RTMP.
On the encoding server, we re-encode the stream into different quality levels and then distribute
it to our very own tiny streaming CDN.</p>

<p>Venueless currently does <strong>not yet</strong> include a video-on-demand component and usually, our customers record
their content at the source, e.g. with OBS or StreamYard, and process or publish them on their own.
However, just to be safe, we keep a recording of the incoming stream as well. This isn’t currently
part of our promoted service offering, we rather see it as a free backup service to our clients in case they
lose their recording. Given that we already consider it to just be a backup, we currently don’t make any
further backups of this data.</p>

<h4 id="data-loss">Data loss</h4>

<p>Usually, we delete these recordings after a while, but in some cases, our customers ask us to get them, e.g.
because their own recording failed, or because StreamYard only records the first 8 hours of every
stream. Since this doesn’t happen a lot, it’s not yet an automated process in our system. Whenever a customer
requests a recording we SSH into the respective encoding server and move the recording file to a
directory that’s accessible through HTTP, like this:</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-12345.flv public/
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it, we share the link with the customer, and the process is done. One of the simplest steps possible
in all this. Yesterday, a customer asked us for the recordings of the two last streams of their event. Just
before finishing up for the week, I wanted to supply them with the required file, SSH’d into the server,
looked for the correct files and typed…</p>

<pre><code>/var/recordings $ mv recording-16678.flv recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Oops.</strong> I hit return before typing out <code>public/</code>, and therefore replaced the last stream with the
second-last, losing one of the videos.</p>

<h4 id="damage-control">Damage control</h4>

<p>Having a very naive understanding of how file systems work, I knew that the <code>mv</code> command has only
changed the directory listing of the file system, but hasn’t actually wiped the file from the disk,
so I knew there is likely still a chance to recover the file, if it’s not overwritten by something
else in the meantime.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t manage to re-mount the root partition as read-only to avoid further damage softly,
I used the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">big hammer</a> to remount
everything read-only immediately:</p>

<pre><code># echo u &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger
</code></pre>

<p>Uhm, okay, this worked, but how do I install any data recovery tools now? After some experiments,
I decided it would be easiest to reboot into the recovery system provided by our server provider
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. So I configured the boot loader to boot their recovery system
from the network and forcefully rebooted the server.</p>

<p>To be able to perform disk dumps and have some operational flexibility without downloading a 2 TB
disk image to my local machine (which would take rougly a week), I also quickly purchased
a <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box">Hetzner Storage Box</a> with 5 TB space.</p>

<h4 id="failed-attempts">Failed attempts</h4>

<p>Just before I executed my fatal <code>mv</code> command, I executed <code>ls -lisah</code> to get a directory listing
of the files:</p>

<pre><code>3146449 1.1G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.1G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16678.flv
3146113 1.6G -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 1.6G Nov XX XX:XX recording-16679.flv
</code></pre>

<p>This meant I <strong>knew</strong> the inode number of the deleted file! As I mentioned before, my understanding
of file systems was (and is) rather naive, and I was pretty optimistic to be able to recover the
file using that information. Isn’t that sort of what a journaling file system is for?</p>

<p>Recovering the file this way hover appeared to be impossible. <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html">ext4magic</a>
and <a href="http://extundelete.sourceforge.net/">extundelete</a> are powerful tools that did find some 
deleted files on my disk – but not the one I was looking for, even after trying different options
for over two hours.</p>

<p>I did not spend the time to really understand how ext4 works, but from what I gathered from various
blogs, I was pretty much out of luck since the inode did no longer contain the relevant information
and ext4magic also wasn’t able to <a href="http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/howto_en.html#Recovery_process_5">recover the neccessary information from the journal</a>
either.</p>

<pre><code>debugfs:  inode_dump &lt;3146113&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>However, if you’re in a similar situation – the ext4magic how-tos are really helpful and worth a try.</p>

<h4 id="successful-recovery">Successful recovery</h4>

<p>There is this one other approach to file recovery that is often recommended on the internet, usually
for “small text files”: Just <code>grep</code> your whole disk for known parts of its contents! So why wouldn’t
this work on larger non-text files as well?</p>

<p>The first problem is obviously what to grep for. The only thing I know about the missing file, apart
from its rough size, is that it’s a FLV video file. Luckily, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Video#Flash_Video_Structure">all FLV files</a>
that contain video start with the byte sequence <code>FLV\x01\x05</code>. So let’s search our 2 TB disk for
that byte sequence and print out the byte offset of all occurences!</p>

<pre><code>cat /dev/md2 \
	| pv -s 1888127576000 \
	| grep -P --byte-offset --text 'FLV\x01\x05' \
	| tee -a /mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt
</code></pre>

<p>This took roughly 7 hours. The <code>pv</code> command with the (rough) total size of the disk is optional, but gives you
a nice progress bar. Overall, this took a little over 6 hours on our server.</p>

<p><code>grep</code> works line-based, which in a binary file menas “any byte sequence between two ASCII line breaks”. The
log file therefore contained lots of lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>184473878409:&lt;some binary data&gt;FLV&lt;some binary data&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In total, the search found 126 FLV file headers on our disk. This was pretty reassuring, since we had 122 FLV files
still known to the file system – so there are at least four FLV byte sequences without a filename!</p>

<pre><code># find /mnt/disk/var/recordings/ -name '*.flv' -not -empty -ls | wc -l
122
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I needed to find out which of the 126 byte sequences did not have a filename. Since I really didn’t want
to spend all weekend with a deep-dive into the ext4 disk layout, I went for an easier solution: For every file
still known in the file system, I computed a hash of the first 500 kilobytes of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>#!/usr/bin/python3
</span><span>import</span> <span>glob</span>
<span>import</span> <span>hashlib</span>
<span>import</span> <span>os</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>h</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_hashes</span><span>:</span>
            <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"duplicate hash found:"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>known_hashes</span><span>[</span><span>h</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>fname</span>

<span>print</span><span>(</span>
    <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>not_deleted_files</span><span>),</span> <span>"files with"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>known_hashes</span><span>),</span> <span>"hashes"</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Interestingly, two files from the completely different customers shared the same hash of the first 500 kilobytes.
I haven’t tested it yet, but my theory is that those were streams that just did not contain any audio or video
in their first minutes, but only empty frames. However, since I knew this isn’t the case for my missing file,
I felt confident in proceeding with this approach.</p>

<p>Next, I computed the same hash for every byte offest found by grep and compared it to the hashes found in the
previous step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>grep_log</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/mnt/storagebox/grep-log.txt'</span>
<span>disk</span> <span>=</span> <span>'/dev/md2'</span>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Isetta Engine is a student-driven project about demystifying game engine development and providing a roadmap and relevant knowledge for novice developers. To do so, <a href="https://isetta.io/team/">our team</a> will make a game engine by ourselves starting from a collection of base frameworks, and document the process, pitfalls, and advice for our audience with periodic blogs. Besides that, we will conduct interviews with experienced professionals to augment our novice perspective. We believe the novice perspective from our blogs and expert perspective from the interviews will nicely come together and form a complete document to help people get started. </p>
<p>The reason we think more work needs to be done in this field is that too many game engine developers wait until the completion of the engine, typically years, to talk about their development. For studios, this is because they consider the final product to be the game, not the engine. For others, it may be because the engine is what they see as valuable, not the writing. As a result, these talks typically lose the minutiae of the actual daily struggles that took place in the development process. There are others who document their development which has been going on for years, which makes it a daunting task for newcomers to start following along. </p>
<p>Although the project is aimed at helping novice developers, this is not to be used as a sole source of learning engine development. Being new engine developers ourselves, we can't guarantee the way we develop the engine will be correct, which is why interviews will help the project remain grounded. This means others who are learning can use what we've done as a guide and not necessarily the ground truth. The blogs won't be a walkthrough/tutorial/step-by-step instructions on how to develop an engine. We are learning as we go and think our journey is what can be valuable to you. </p>
<h3 id="about-the-project">About the Project<a href="#about-the-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This project is being done as a student-pitched project at the <a href="https://www.etc.cmu.edu/">Entertainment Technology Center</a> (ETC). The ETC is an interdisciplinary Master's degree program at Carnegie Mellon University where students' main focus is working on small teams on a project each semester during a 3-month time period. Throughout the semester, a team's work will be presented to faculty and peers with feedback and critique being presented to help aid in the project development. Our particular project idea has gone through multiple iterations to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplify the engine to be feasible within 3 months and</li>
<li>Deliver content that would be useful, and hopefully enjoyable, to consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>As of writing this, we've learned that creating content that will satisfy both is difficult and time-consuming, so we will be focusing on writing these milestone-type blogs as well as posting various types of content to test which is the best form of presenting our work. The short project duration also forces us to think clearly about our scope and be lean on the features we include before starting. </p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule<a href="#schedule" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the course of this project <strong>(08/26 - 12/16, 2018</strong>), a blog post will be published every week to share our thoughts and process, and an interview will be published every 1-2 weeks. The interview schedule depends on our progress on the engine itself, as each interview's topic will be themed around our current work.</p>

<p>Although we will cover some basic features of engine development, it will profoundly help if you have experience in C++ programming and developing software, especially games, as our project won't provide step-by-step instructions on how to do everything. For a list of resources on how to gain related knowledge, please go to the <a href="#Readings">Readings</a> section. Additional resources will be posted on our <a href="https://isetta.io/resources/">resource page</a>.</p>
<p>Another prerequisite is passion for learning game engine development. As you are still reading this, we assume you are as excited about this as we are. This will be a bumpy ride, but you will have us on your side.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research<a href="#research" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Being a student-pitched ETC project means that the project needed to pass through a pitch process of consulting and convincing faculty in the program. This allowed us to receive feedback about what could be considered a reasonable/manageable scope and where we might hit challenges for a general project. For this project to be a valid ETC project as well as accomplish our mission statement, there needs to be a fine balance between documentation and development. </p>
<p>Before confronting the big monster of engine development and documentation, we thought it would be a good idea to gear up by getting input from people who have actually done this. During our pitch process, we reached out and got the chance to talk to numerous industry professionals and got extremely helpful advice from them. All of these suggestions helped us shape our project into what it is now and provided invaluable knowledge on how to start a game engine. Thus we encourage you, too, to approach professionals and get advice if possible. We've compiled our notes from our conversations with them into a write-up, which will be published soon.</p>
<h3 id="why-another-engine">Why another engine?<a href="#why-another-engine" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using an existing game engine like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal</a> or <a href="https://www.panda3d.org/">Panda3D</a> is always a handy option to make a game. These well-established engines have a strong collection of tools and APIs so that developers can focus on making the game, not the wheels. However, there is the limitation of not having full control over all systems in the engine as well as not knowing how the engine is processing the game logic and assets. These can obstruct the complex systems of an engine, so although you may have an understanding of how a physics or graphics engine works, each engine operates differently and optimizes for different constraints. </p>
<p>In terms of learning about game engines and how to develop one, these established engines aren't a good source. Panda3D, originally developed by Disney and expanded by past ETC projects, has an older codebase in 2018 with limited community involvement. It is also not using the current industry standard language (C++). Unity and Unreal are both too massive and too cutting-edge to be suitable engine learning material for novices. In addition, Unity's source code isn't publicly available so you technically can't learn from it. The huge codebase sets a high threshold for any beginner to get started.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap<a href="#roadmap" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Isetta Engine will support the most primitive form of networked multiplayer twin-stick shooter game. Networked multiplayer was selected to be a part of the engine because it offers significant design and development challenge on every level of the project, and will help differentiate this engine from others being developed. We decided to create the engine in 3D for two reasons: Most AAA engines are 3D, and 3D requires more math and problem solving for us as developers to learn and grow from.</p>
<p>While planning, and before we knew too much about game engines, we had a basic idea of what a game engine would consist of. The image below displays the second/third iteration of what the Isetta engine would look like. We were initially naive thinking we may be able to do both networking as well as physics, however quickly came to grips that would balloon the scope too much. The audio and graphics were and are still planned to be imported from external libraries, and more of the discussion of what is imported and why will be included in a future blog. This diagram of the engine will soon be replaced with more in-depth explanations.</p>
<p><img alt="alt_text" src="https://isetta.io/images/blogs/week-0/pitch_architecture.png" title="Engine Architecture During Pitch"></p>
<h3 id="genre">Genre<a href="#genre" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As for our choice of the twin-stick shooter genre, we came to the decision after lengthy consideration of the components required to build other game types as well as how that genre would utilize multiplayer. Twin-stick shooters can effectively have little to no physics, which is different from collisions (this will be explained in <a href="https://isetta.io/blogs/week-1/">week 1 blog</a>). Likewise, the information passed between networked sessions is relatively minimal and not too strict on latency. What's more, a twin-stick shooter specializes in simplistic gameplay that doesn't need a world editor or too much design. </p>
<p>In a Skype meeting, <a href="https://waltdestler.com/">Walt Destler</a> explained to us that each game -and more particularly, each genre- requires vastly different netcode solutions. This is also one of the reasons why we prefer netcode over physics, as it can greatly narrow down the genre options. For example, multiplayer shooters, specifically PvP shooters, require small amounts of information to be passed (i.e. bullet and player locations) from server to client with relatively low latency. PvP shooters can also feature client-side prediction <sup id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as well as the additional requirement of lobby/matchmaking with usually more than 2 players. On the other hand, genres like turn-based strategy require large amounts of information to be passed (all units, decisions, resources, etc.) to all users without too much concern for latency or prediction.</p>
<h3 id="building-with-an-example-game">Building with an Example Game<a href="#building-with-an-example-game" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The other piece of advice we frequently heard from professionals and our faculty alike was the benefit of developing a game in conjunction with the engine. Doing so, they explained, allows you to prove and demonstrate your engine works as expected. The game can also test features to show immediate edge cases of the engine. </p>
<p>Another nicety of developing an engine is that feature creep can be prevented when you keep expanding certain features that won't be utilized in the final product. What the game built from this engine <em>won't</em> be is something original or necessarily fun. However, that's not to say a fun, original game couldn't be created from this engine. The idea of our sample game is to intentionally be derivative so features of a basic twin-stick shooter will be already included in the engine, rather than only specific …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

	<time datetime="2020-11-28">November 28, 2020</time>
  
	<p>Growl is being retired after surviving for 17 years. With the announcement of Apple’s new hardware platform, a general shift of developers to Apple’s notification system, and a lack of obvious ways to improve Growl beyond what it is and has been, we’re announcing the retirement of Growl as of today.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming. Growl is the project I worked on for the longest period of my open source career. However at WWDC in 2012 everyone on the team saw the writing on the wall. This was my only WWDC. This is the WWDC where Notification Center was announced. Ironically Growl was called Global Notifications Center, before I renamed it to Growl because I thought the name was too geeky. There’s even a sourceforge project for Global Notifications Center still out there if you want to go find it.</p>

<p>We’ve had a lot of support over the years; from our hosting providers at <a href="http://www.networkredux.com/">Network Redux</a>, <a href="http://www.cachefly.com/">CacheFly</a> and others, to all of the apps using our framework, bindings, or any other integration. Special thanks go to <a href="https://adium.im/">Adium</a> and <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>. Without these two projects having developers who wanted different types notifications, Growl wouldn’t have existed. Without Growl I do not know that we would have any sort of decent notification system in OS X, iOS, Android or who knows what else. </p>

<p>Special thanks goes to <a href="https://www.transifex.com/">Transifex</a> who made localizing into 24 languages a lot easier than anything else we tried. It’s a fantastic product, if you make software please try it. Our localizers were fantastic people and should all be commended for their work. </p>

<p>For developers we recommend transitioning away from Growl at this point. The apps themselves are gone from the app store, however the code itself still lives. Everything from our rake build system to our code is available for use on our <a href="https://github.com/growl/growl/">GitHub page</a></p>

</div><p>Swiss public television, SRF, has found a second company besides Crypto AG&nbsp;was involved in manufacturing manipulated devices allegedly used for spying by foreign intelligence.</p>

<time datetime="2020-11-26T11:34:28+01:00">

</time><p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/verschluesselungsgeraete-geheimdienstaffaere-weitere-schweizer-firma-rueckt-in-den-fokus">SRF sources</a>, the Swiss company Omnisec AG had ties to US intelligence services. This follows revelations in February by SRF, German television ZDF and <em>The Washington Post</em> that Zug-based firm Crypto AG was at the heart of a huge international spying operation led by the CIA, and to a lesser extent by the German BND spy agency.&nbsp;Omnisec was one of the largest competitors of Crypto AG.</p><p>Swiss cryptologist and professor Ueli Maurer was a consultant for Omnisec for years and told SRF that in 1989 US intelligence services (National Security Agency) contacted Omnisec through him.</p><p>Of concern are the OC-500 series devices. Devices were sold to several Swiss federal agencies. However, Swiss&nbsp;authorities only noticed the devices weren't secure&nbsp;in the mid-2000s.</p><p>Several Swiss companies also received manipulated devices from Omnisec, including Switzerland’s largest bank, UBS. It is unclear whether the authorities informed UBS about the weak devices in the mid-2000s. UBS told SRF that it does not comment on security matters but that it had no indications that sensitive data were exposed at the time.</p>
<p>Omnisec, founded in 1987, manufactured voice, fax and data encryption equipment. It was dissolved a few years ago. The most recent head of the company, Clemens Kammer, told SRF that Omnisec customers “have and will continue to place great value on security, confidentiality, discretion and reliability in business relationships”.</p><p>Some politicians have called for further investigations into these latest allegations that may reveal who, if anyone, in the federal government knew of Omnisec’s business affairs with foreign intelligence.</p><h2>Crypto affair</h2><p>Earlier this month, a nine-month&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201110183555/https:/www.parlament.ch/press-releases/Pages/mm-gpdel-2020-11-10.aspx">investigation</a>&nbsp;by the Swiss parliamentary audit committee (GPDel), found that the Swiss intelligence service knew that the US Central Intelligence Agency was behind the Swiss-based Crypto AG as far back as 1993. The report says that Swiss intelligence later collaborated with them to gather information from foreign sources.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 100 countries bought encryption devices from the Zug-based company, which did business under the guise of Swiss neutrality. In reality, the firm belonged to the CIA and Germany intelligence service, which could freely read what it encrypted. Information intercepted with the help of Crypto’s devices changed the course of events, including the Iran hostage crisis of 1979.</p> </section>

		<p><span><em>(5 minutes read)</em></span></p>
<p><span>My oldest son Noah turned 7 three months ago. If he could trade his family for a 2 hour session of playing minecraft, he would do it in a heartbeat. The other love of his life is Super Mario Maker, and&nbsp;it’s been a thrill to see him play the same game and levels that I played when I was his age. About 5 months ago, I left my family for my yearly pilgrimage of <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">ludum dare</a>: a game dev competition during which I lock myself away with friends, return to a&nbsp;state of primitive caveman, not sleep for 48h, and create&nbsp;a full game from scratch (play it at the end of this post!) As I proudly showed my revolutionary AAA title to my wife, Noah was naturally intrigued and I introduced him to the world of code, showing him how simple&nbsp;words&nbsp;(he had just learned how to read) produced an actual game. Since&nbsp;that very day, Noah&nbsp;has been asking me repeatedly to teach him how to make&nbsp;his own video games. And for the past 5 months, I have been looking for the holy grail of language/IDE for kids in the hope of turning that spark of interest into a memorable experience…</span></p>
<p><span>My quest has led me to&nbsp;endless forums, through which I have tried countless suggestions: SmallBasic, Pico-8, Smalltalk, Scratch, etc. I have even inquired of the Great&nbsp;Oracles of StackOverflow,&nbsp;to&nbsp;no avail. After 5 months,&nbsp;I&nbsp;ended up with a disappointing conclusion: nothing is even close to what I had back in another era. 30 years later, QBasic is still the best when it comes to&nbsp;discovering programming.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“OMG please don’t teach him GOTOs!!”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>10 PRINT “OH NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!!”
20 GOTO 10</code></pre>
<p><span>Yes, QBasic is a terrible procedural language. It introduces one to concepts widely considered harmful, uses awkward syntax for implicit declarations, is not case sensitive, is non-zero-based, etc. the list goes on… When developing a skill, it is much better to acquire the right reflexes from the start rather than have to correct years of bad practice. Following this advice, I should have probably started off with&nbsp;the basics of the ruby language which I love. Yet, while most of those QBasic concepts are today generally considered&nbsp;as red flags by our peers, they each served a very specific&nbsp;purpose at the time: to keep the language simple and accessible, a notion that every other language has left behind in favor of flexibility, complexity and logic.</span></p>
<p><span>I installed QBasic on my son’s 11” HP Stream today, having to hack a DOSBox manual installation. He double clicked the icon on his desktop and in a split second, we were in the IDE, greeted with the introduction screen which brought back so many memories to my mind:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/QBasic_Opening_Screen.png" alt="" width="640" height="400"></p>
<p><span>I then told Noah that there was a very sacred ritual, mandatory&nbsp;for anyone who enters the secret&nbsp;inner&nbsp;circle of programmers, to start off with a program that greets every other programmer out there. As I dictated the formula, he slowly&nbsp;searched for each&nbsp;key, carefully&nbsp;typing with his right finger&nbsp;the magic words: <code>PRINT “hello world”</code></span></p>
<p><span>He pressed F5 and looked amazed as he saw his code being compiled into text rendered on his black screen. He smiled, gave me a high-five, and then scribbled down the code in his little notebook so that he could remember later.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>We went on to a couple more commands: CLS, COLOR, PLAY, INPUT, and IF. There was nothing to explain: no complexity, no awkward operator, no abstract concepts, no documentation that needed to be read, no notion of objects/class/methods, no framework to install, no overwhelming menu/buttons in the IDE, no special keyword or parenthesis. It was code in its purest simplicity and form.</p>
<p><span>After less than an hour, he wrote his first program on his own – an interactive and incredibly subtle application which lets you know the computer’s feelings towards&nbsp;you as an individual and sensible human being:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_3.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>…which he ran with utmost pride for his cousin and best friend Christian:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>…after which he proceeded to easily explain him&nbsp;</span><span><b>how</b></span><span>&nbsp;it worked and what the code was doing!</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_5.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p><span>And so it was that in a single hour, my 7 year old was able to not only write his first text game, but also to experience the fun and thrill that comes from creating, compiling and executing his own little program. Bonus points, it all fit on a single notebook page:</span></p>
<p><img src="http://nicolasbize.com/blog/images/noah_2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800"></p>
<p><span>I was so glad that he was able to understand why I keep saying that I have the best job in the world.&nbsp;</span><span>My only regret today was to realize that in more than 30 years, we have not been able to come up with something&nbsp;better for our kids: Qbasic has a limited set of simple keywords (the entire help fits on a single F1 screen and is packed with simple examples!), does not distract the coder with any visual artifacts, has a very confined and cosy dev environment, shows errors as early as possible, compiles and executes the code in a heartbeat with a single key, and is extremely straightforward. &nbsp;We have built more robust and more complex languages/frameworks/IDEs (which are of course necessary for any real-life application), but we have never really made a simpler or more direct access to the thrill of programming than QBasic. Even running QBasic today has become dreadful&nbsp;to the novice that uses&nbsp;a modern Mac/PC/Linux machine, whereas it used to simply require inserting a 3,5” floppy in the A:\ disk drive…</span></p>
<p><span>Enough rant, today is all about the celebration of yet another person who discovered the excitement and beauty of programming!</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers!</span></p>
<p><span>(as promised, <a href="http://nicolasbize.com/ld34/">my AAA title</a> for which I await&nbsp;EA’s call to purchase copyrights)</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7dbf04694dfeeec9985b2ebb27cc1faff153111b/75e93/assets/img/2020/m1/m1.jpg"></p><p>The excitement around Apple’s new M1 chip is <a href="https://www.singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">everywhere</a>. I bought a MacBook Air 16GB M1 to see how viable it is as main development machine - here’s an early report after a week of testing.</p><h2 id="xcode">Xcode</h2><p>Xcode runs FAST on the M1. Compiling the <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/">PSPDFKit PDF SDK</a> (debug, arm64) can almost compete with the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro Apple offers to date, with <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332052251712614405?s=21">8:49 min vs 7:31 min</a>. For comparison, my Hackintosh builds the same in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>One can’t overstate how impressive this is for a fan-less machine. Apple’s last experiment with fan-less MacBooks was the 12-inch version from 2017, which builds the same project in 41 minutes.</p><p>Our tests mostly ran just fine, although I found <a href="https://github.com/Aloshi/dukglue/pull/27">a bug specific to arm64</a> that we missed before, as we don’t run our tests on actual hardware on CI. Moving the Simulator to the same architecture as shipping devices will be beneficial and will help find more bugs.</p><p>Testing iOS below 14 is problematic. It seems <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332654247809257473?s=21">WebKit is crashing in a memory allocator</a>, throwing EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (code=EXC_I386_INVOP, subcode=0x0) (Apple folks: FB8920323). Performance also seems really bad, with Xcode periodically <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332348616145563653?s=21">freezing</a> and the whole system becoming so <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1332648748158246922?s=21">slow</a> that the mouse cursor gets choppy. Some Simulators even make problems on iOS 14, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1331628274783543297?s=21">such as the iPad Air (4th gen) which still emulates Intel</a>, so try to avoid that one.</p><p>We were extremely excited to be moving our CI to Mac Mini’s with M1 chip and are <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">waiting on MacStadium to release devices</a>, however it seems we will have to restrict tests to iOS 14 for that to work. With our current schedule, we plan to drop iOS 12 in Q3 2021 and iOS 13 in Q3 2022, so it will be a while until we can fully move to Apple Silicon.</p><p>There is a chance that Apple fixes these issues, however it’s not something to count on - given that this only affects older versions of iOS, the problem will at some point just “go away”.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> We’re working around the WebKit crashes for now via detecting Rosetta2 translation at runtime and simply skipping the tests where WebKit is used. This isn’t great, but luckily we’re not using WebKit a lot in our current project. <a href="https://gist.github.com/steipete/e15b1fabffc7da7d49c92e3fbd06971a">See my Gist for details</a>. Performance seems acceptable if you restrict parallel testing to at most two instances - else the system simply runs out of RAM and swapping is just really slow.</p><h2 id="docker">Docker</h2><p>We use Docker to automate our Website and load environments for our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/web/">Web and Server PDF SDKs</a>. Docker posted a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/">status update blog post</a> about the current state of things, admitting that it currently won’t work but that they’re <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142">working on it</a>. There are more <a href="https://finestructure.co/blog/2020/11/27/running-docker-on-apple-silicon-m1-follow-up">hacky ways to use Apple’s Hypervisor to run Docker container manually</a>, however this needs arm-based containers.</p><p>I expect a solution in Q1 2021 that runs arm-based containers. We’ll have to do some work to add arm-support (something already on the roadmap) so this is only a transitional issue.</p><h2 id="virtualization-and-windows">Virtualization and Windows</h2><p>To test our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/pdf-sdk/windows/">Windows PDF SDK</a>, most folks are using a VMware virtual machine with Windows 10 and Visual Studio. Currently none of the Mac virtualisation solutions support Apple Silicon, however both <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/11/parallels-confirms-apple-m1-support-amid-silence-from-other-virtualization-companies">VMware and Parallels</a> are working on it. I do not expect Virtualbox to be updated <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=98742">anytime soon</a>.</p><p>I expect that eventually we’ll be able to run ARM-based Windows with commercial tooling. Various <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/27/arm-windows-virtualization-m1-mac/">proof-of-concepts</a> already exist, and performance seems <a href="https://twitter.com/imbushuo/status/1332772957609922561?s=21">extremely promising</a>. Microsoft currently doesn’t sell ARM-based Windows, so getting a license will be interesting.</p><p>ARM-Windows can emulate x86 applications, and Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/it039s-official-x64-emulation-is-coming-to-windows-on-arm">x64 emulation</a>, which is already rolling out in Insider builds. In a few months, it should be possible to develop and test our Windows SDK with Visual Studio on M1 in reasonable performance.</p><p>Running older versions of macOS might be more problematic. We currently support macOS 10.14 with our <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-for-macos/">AppKit PDF SDK</a> and macOS 10.15 with the <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/pspdfkit-for-mac-catalyst/">Catalyst PDF SDK</a>, both OS releases that require testing. It remains to be seen if VMWare or Parallels include a complete x64 emulation layer. This would likely be really slow, so I wouldn’t count on it.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bbf100981357e4bc26c49722d31253daf76d293d/5b456/assets/img/2020/m1/memory.png" alt=""></p><p>Lastly, 16 GB RAM just isn’t a lot. When running parallel tests, the machine starts to heavily swap and performance really goes down the drain. This will be even more problematic with virtual machines running. Future machines will offer 32 GB options to alleviate this issue.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/e4313b9c14e968764a52375da41b4278#file-readme-md">How to run Windows 10 on ARM in Qemu with Hypervisor.framework patches on Apple Silicon Mac</a></p><h2 id="android-studio">Android Studio</h2><p>IntelliJ is working on porting the <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-2526">JetBrains Runtime</a> to Apple Silicon. The apps currently work through Rosetta 2, however building via Gradle is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/jx4ntt/apple_macbook_air_m1_is_very_slow_in_gradle_builds/">extremely slow</a>. Gradle creates code at runtime, which seems a particular bad combination with the Rosetta 2 ahead-of-time translation logic.</p><p>I expect that most issues will be solved by Q1 2021, however it will likely be some more time until all Java versions run great on ARM. A lot of effort has been put into <a href="https://bell-sw.com/java/arm/performance/2019/01/15/the-status-of-java-on-arm/">loop unrolling and vectorisation</a>, not everything there is available on ARM just yet.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.azul.com/press_release/azul-announces-support-of-java-builds-of-openjdk-for-apple-silicon/">Azul offers macOS JDKs for arm64</a>, including for <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?os=macos&amp;architecture=arm-64-bit&amp;package=jdk">Java 8</a>.</p><h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2><p><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> currently works via Rosetta 2. Just prefix everything with <code>arch -x86_64</code> and it’ll just work. It is possible to install an additional (arm-based) version of Homebrew <a href="https://soffes.blog/homebrew-on-apple-silicon">under <code>/opt/homebrew</code></a> and mix setup, as <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">more and more software</a> is adding support for arm.</p><p>This is not a problem currently (performance is good) and will eventually just work natively.</p><h2 id="applications">Applications</h2><p>Most applications just work, Rosetta is barely noticeable. Larger apps to take a longer initial performance hit (e.g. Microsoft Word takes <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-will-be-about-20-second-slower-initially-on-apple-silicon-rosetta-2/">around 20 seconds</a> until everything is translated), but then these binaries are cached and subsequent runs are fast.</p><p>There’s the occasional app that can’t be translated and fails on startup (e.g. <a href="https://beamer-app.com/download">Beamer</a> or the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_gh/drive/download/">Google Drive “Backup and Sync” client</a>), but this is rare. Some apps are confused about their place on disk and ask to be moved to the Applications directory, when really it’s just the translated binary that runs somewhere else. Most of these dialogs can be ignored. Some apps (e.g. Visual Studio Code) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1331884524934995968?s=21">block auto-updating</a> as the translated app location is readonly. However, in case of VS Code, the Insider build is already updated to ARM and just works.</p><p>Electron-based apps are slow if they run on Rosetta. It seems the highly optimized V8 JavaScript compiler blocks ahead-of-time translation. The latest stable version of Electron (Version 11) already <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/blog/apple-silicon">fully supports Apple Silicon</a>, and companies like Slack already updated their beta version to run natively.</p><p>Google just shipped <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3597749/google-releases-chrome-87-with-support-for-apple-silicon-macs.html">Chrome that runs on ARM</a>, however there’s still quite a performance gap between it and Apple Safari, which just <em>flies</em> on Apple Silicon.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The new M1 MacBooks are fast, beautiful and silent and the hype is absolutely justified. There’s still a lot to do on the software-front to catch up, and the bugs around older iOS Simulators are especially problematic.</p><p>All of that can be fixed in software and the whole industry is currently working on making the experience better, so by next year, when Apple updates the 16-inch MacBook Pro and releases the next generation of their M chip line, it should be absolutely possible to use a M1 Mac as main dev machine.</p><p>For the time being, the M1 will be my <del>travel</del> secondary laptop, and I’ll keep working on the 2,4 GHz 16-inch MacBook Pro with 32 GB RAM, which just is the faster machine. I’ll be much harder to accept the loud, always-on fans though, now that I know what soon will be possible.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my <a href="https://datagubbe.se/ltmag/">Amiga</a>, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today, I want to address an issue with statements involving chance. To demonstrate, let’s first consider a statement that doesn’t involve chance:</p>

<p>“<em>A cubic die tossed onto a flat surface will come to rest on one of its six sides.</em>”</p>

<p>This claim can be empirically tested, with various dice and surfaces. If any one of our experiments results in the die spinning endlessly on a corner, we will have disproven the claim. We may have to refine the claim’s conditions; for instance, by requiring the presence of gravity. Nonetheless, it’s fairly clear what it means for the statement to be true or false. Now let’s try to make a claim involving probability:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown, the probability of their face-up sides summing to nine will be one in nine (about 0.11 or 11%).</em>”</p>

<p>What does it mean for this statement to be true? Unlike the first statement, this one doesn’t specify which result we’ll actually see. How can we possibly hope to test it, or to make use of its information?</p>



<p>Within the realm of abstract mathematics, we’re free to model probability in a way that fits our intuitions. Imagine a multiverse containing an infinity of possible worlds, whose total <em>measure</em> is 100%. Define the probability of an <em>event</em>, such as that of rolling a nine, to be the measure assigned to the subset of worlds in which the event actually occurs.</p>

<p>In the abstract formalism, we’re allowed to assign the measure however we like, subject to Kolmogorov’s axioms: the measure must be non-negative, countably additive, and total to 100%. By respecting the symmetry of an idealized die,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> we might argue that only one such assignment makes sense; from it, we can calculate the probability of any event involving dice rolls.</p>

<p>There are two shortcomings to this approach. Firstly, we won’t always deal with nicely symmetrical objects for which direct a priori arguments are possible. Thus, we still need a means of testing probabilistic claims using real-life observations. Secondly, such arguments can never be airtight: after all, how can we hope to infer the measure on a hypothetical multiverse, when we only ever experience <em>one</em> world? Indeed, a realist might question if it makes any sense to discuss the chances of an event happening: either it happens or it doesn’t!</p>



<p>You might be more trusting of someone who puts their money where their mouth is. To back up a definite claim, not involving chance, I can simply agree to pay a penalty if it turns out I’m wrong.</p>

<p>This idea can be extended to probabilistic claims in the following manner: consider a lottery that pays a $90 jackpot if the next roll of a pair of dice yields a nine. If the maximum that I’m willing to pay to play is $10, this indicates that I believe a not-nine roll is eight times more likely than a nine roll. This approach is appealing because, after all, the <em>raison d’être</em> of probability theory is to explain the decision-making of individuals facing uncertainty.</p>

<p>If another gambler’s view conflicts with mine, you may aggregate our beliefs by creating a market on which we buy and sell predictions. Consider a contract that pays $100 (plus interest) when a specified event occurs. Its price on the market can be interpreted as the percentage probability of that event. Thus, to say an event is twice as “likely” as another, simply means its market price is double.</p>

<p>Unlike your typical gambler, a frictionless market offers transparent near-identical buy and sell prices. As a result, any violations of Kolmogorov’s axioms become money-making arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrage activity acts as an enforcer of the axioms, creating what economists call the <em>risk-neutral probability measure</em>.</p>

<p>In real markets, however, this probability measure exhibits several inconsistenties. Firstly, it depends on which currency is used: as an extreme example, we wouldn’t buy a dollar-denominated wager that only pays out if the dollar collapses, no matter how likely we imagine the collapse to be. Secondly, this measure is sensitive to (non-diversifiable) risk: if a widely-believed prophecy held that rolling a nine would induce a catastrophic famine, the market would value this outcome a lot more, because everyone wants to buy insurance against such a catastrophe. Thirdly, markets can be misinformed: indeed, one motivation for participating in a market is to try to beat it! And finally, liquid markets are hard to set up.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we abandon this approach. We’ll seek to define probability in terms of actual outcomes instead of human bets. Nonetheless, human bets are what inspired the creation of probability theory: it’s hard to think of any other practical application! Therefore, we should remember to revisit the matter once we’ve found an appealing probability concept. Ultimately, we must be able to explain <em>how</em> individuals and markets behave with respect to our concept, and answer <em>why</em> they should care about it at all.</p>

<p>These questions are incredibly subtle: the theory of evolution by natural selection tells us that individuals are wired to use strategies that enabled their ancestors’ survival; however, the nature of probabilistic beliefs is that a wide range of outcomes are plausible. Indeed, while a coin will always land heads or tails, it’s considered unwise to bet your life savings on either heads or tails. Intuitively speaking, the rationale is that you’re almost certain to lose <em>eventually</em>, if you keep playing this way. This idea of repeated trials inspires our next interpretation, which happens to be the most popular among scientists.</p>



<p>According to the frequentist school of thought, a probabilistic statement is not to be taken literally. Although it refers to a single event, the statement should be taken as shorthand for a claim involving a very large collection of similar events. Imagine rolling the dice over and over. The probabilistic claim that we started with is converted into the following:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown repeatedly, then in the limit as the number of throws goes to infinity, the proportion of nines converges to one in nine (about 0.11 or 11%).</em>”</p>

<p>The short-run probability is replaced by a long-run proportion. Given an infinite sequence of rolls, this statement unambiguously reveals itself to be true or false. In light of the frequentist interpretation, we can even make more sense of our earlier interpretations. While we only experience one world, repeating an experiment under similar conditions is like observing the experiment in a parallel universe: whether we count trials or worlds, the math is virtually identical. In the limit of infinitely many bets, we can make some unambiguous conclusions about the quality of a gambler’s strategy, too: this is how casinos ensure that the house always wins!</p>

<p>Testing our claim is a simple matter: we roll the dice, over and over, and over and over… infinity times. Oops. Of course, there is no such thing as an experiment with infinity trials. Our arms will get tired, the dice will wear out, the Sun will explode, and all the free energy in the universe will be consumed. At best, we can do a very large number of trials. Let’s say we roll dice 9,000 times; one in nine of these would be 1,000. Perhaps we won’t roll exactly 1,000 nines, so let’s interpret our claim with a suitable margin of error, called a <em>confidence interval</em>:</p>

<p>“<em>If a pair of standard dice are thrown 9,000 times, then the face-up sides will sum to nine for between 920 and 1,080 of the throws.</em>”</p>

<p>The probability of obtaining between 920 and 1,080 nines can be calculated to be 99.3%.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we’ve turned a probabilitic statement into a much more certain but still probabilistic statement. If we observe 1,100 nines, we should be able to dismiss the probabilistic claim as false. And yet, if every household on Earth were to independently perform this 9,000-throw experiment, we should expect that a great many of their results would fall outside the confidence interval. They would disagree on the truth of our statement!</p>

<p>There’s no getting around it: despite its intuitive appeal, the frequentist definition of probability is circular, reducing probability claims to probability claims.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> To end the cycle, the frequentist chooses a threshold (say, 99%) beyond which to treat events as objective truths. This grants the claim an empirically observable meaning. And yet, the frequentist must take care not to consider too many such events, for otherwise the probability of <em>at least one</em> of the events failing may ALSO exceed the threshold of certainty: a logical contradiction.</p>

<p>Things only work out nicely in the limit of infinite sample size. Statisticians mainly deal with experiments which can be repeated so many times that, for most practical purposes, their conclusions can be treated as definite. Non-philosophers are usually happy to ignore a sub-1% chance of error; and if that’s not good enough, make it 0.0001%! Confidence can be increased by gathering more data, i.e., increasing the sample size.</p>

<p>This approach turns out to be very powerful. By designing more complex hypotheses in which probabilities vary as a function of context variables, even some phenomena that aren’t easily repeatable can be statistically analyzed. For example, weather forecasts are based on well-tested models that use measurements of variables such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind.</p>

<p>On the other hand, statistical models of sports games, democratic elections, or company stocks tend to be less testable: the interactions are very complex and there are too few outcomes from which to extrapolate. Similarly, when you try to predict which colleges will admit you or which of your friends will start a business, you don’t make your case using repeatable tests. Clearly, the frequentist interpretation cannot apply. One may argue that no conclusions in these cases would hold up to a scientific standard; nonetheless, if we seek a theory of decision-making under uncertainty, there’s no …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><strong>DECODING THE DRUIDIC DODECAHEDRON </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Dodecahedron%20Types.jpg" width="900" height="438"></p>
<p><strong>These bronze artefacts are so-called <em>Roman</em> dodecahedra (plural of dodecahedron)  of which about 120 have been found in the Celtic countries of Europe. Strangely, none of these have been found in Italy, home turf of the Romans.</strong> <strong>To the left is seen a dodecahedron from the Römermuseum Schwarzenacker, Homburg, Germany collection. To the right is seen another pristine example from the Hunt Museum in Limerick Ireland </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Dodecahedron%20Types3.jpg" width="935" height="438"></p>
<p><strong>To the left is a dodecahedron from Archaeological  Service Canton Aargau, Brugg, Switzerland (Vindonissa Museum). To the right is a dodecahedron from the Gallo-Roman Museum, Tongeren, Belgium. </strong></p>
<p>The basic design of these artefacts remains relatively constant (12 pentagonal faces with knop-shaped legs), however, there can be a range of different  incised designs in the layout of the faces<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>The actual function of these artefacts cannot be explained by our historians or archaeologists, although many theories abound,  none of which seem particularly convincing. Also, there is no  mention of these items in old historical records of the Romans or those of anyone else for that matter. They are such an enigma that academics have pretty-much come to the defeatist conclusion that <em><strong>"we will never know what these dodecahedrons were used for". </strong></em></p>
<p>In reviewing the academic literature, one begins to see why the mystery will probably never be solved within that community. Here are some of the impediments and pitfalls our experts create for themselves:</p>
<p>All archaeological measurements are given in metric increments (centimetres or millimetres), which is a modern system that was created as much as 2000-years after some of these dodecahedra were cast in bronze. Earlier exemplars in stone or wood could predate the latter, more refined ones, by yet another thousand years or more. This  metric measurement preoccupation renders the  encoded numbers invisible or unrecognisable. Our academics know a large swathe of the ancient measurements that were in use two thousand years ago or before, so why not apply them to this study? </p>
<p>Most assuredly, the various sized holes in the 12-faces, the concentric circles that circumnavigate them, as well as the additional incised lines or dotted circles, etc, infer that there is something vividly measurable going on and it's evident that each hole or ring  has been very purposely fabricated to represent a known, precise and sought-after measurement.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.celticnz.co.nz/OrgImages/Dodecahedron/Calibrated.jpg" width="900" height="476"> </p>
<p><strong>A number of dodecahedra have calibration marks along their edges or around the holes in their faces. To the left is seen a calibrated dodecahedron from Hereford Museum, Kenchester and to the right is seen another from Goodrich Castle. Yet another one found in Wales shows etched calibration marks. </strong></p>
<p>In their reports,  archaeologists will often round out measurements of the holes in the dodecahedron faces to the nearest millimetre only, which is grossly insufficient. It's much appreciated by researchers when measurements can be supplied to 1/10th  of a millimetre, but  it is nigh on impossible  to acquire more refined measurements undertaken with electronic vernier callipers. Precise measurements and scaling must precede any serious analysis of these artefacts, but our experts don't seem to think there would be anything significant to find anyway, so don't subject the dodecahedra to rigorous measurement analysis.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that 25.4 millimetres (1 British Standard Inch) or fraction expressions of the same will recur repeatedly in the faces of dodecahedra, no-one seems to have arrived at the conclusion that the enigmatic<em><strong> "inch"</strong></em> recurrence is worthy of serious investigation. </p>
<p>Almost anything considered high-art, technically advanced or an engineering feat within ancient European civilisations seems to be automatically attributed to the Romans, which is certainly the case for these dodecahedra artefacts. This  is a hangover of biased, classicist-isolationist historical  interpretations of  European history where, first came the  Roman conquerors, who finally retreated after centuries of domination, only to be replaced by Rome's State church. With the pedigree of the church being Greco-Roman it was in their interests to push the concept that the Roman armies had found everything in the regions they invaded to be backwards, rudimentary or crude until Rome delivered the great-unwashed masses out of their depravity and into  enlightenment and high-civilisation. </p>
<p>This general process of misattribution further hobbles or seriously limits proper investigation into the purpose and function of dodecahedra artefacts, inasmuch as focus is  directed, almost exclusively, to what Roman armies might have used them for as range-finders or other battle related paraphernalia, including club-heads. The druids or others don't get  any serious consideration, despite the fact that they are historically recorded as having been  advanced mathematicians and astronomers.</p>
<p>Within controlled academia the ability to do open-ended, ground-breaking research can be severely curtailed by the requirements of <em><strong>"peer review"</strong></em> by colleagues.  This is largely a racket that ensures one doesn't move too far from the protected consensus opinion upon which academic reputations are built and anyone venturing too far out into left field is considered a maverick who threatens the insulated central body.</p>
<p>By the same token academia, these days, is lumbered with deep-set social responsibilities and crippling political agendas. When it comes to European history, especially, the requirement is to be self-effacing, while lauding and applauding the (often meager) accomplishments of other ethnicities. Under  guises of political correctness and racial sensitivity, the door is opened for antagonistic non-European, prejudiced individuals, to write and interpret  our history for us, while pushing their own  cultural-Marxist or similar wheel-barrows.  All one has to do is sit through lectures in our western universities to see just how far out of kilter the abysmal problem of  European history-misrepresentation has become.</p>
<p>But, with regards to the dodecahedra artefacts,what one person can build, another can generally duplicate or back-engineer, sufficient to make sense of what's going on. </p>
<p>So, let's cut to the chase, bypass all the  confusion of modern-day naysayers and source testimony directly from an observer who lived contemporary to the druids, before they fell under Roman domination </p>
<p>Julius Caesar, who was a very thorough historian, writes the       following regarding the late era druids of his time (circa 55 BC) and        practices within their many universities in Britain, where students from Gaul       and elsewhere, including Rome, went for training:</p>
<p><strong>'They hold aloof from war and do not pay war taxes; they       are excused from military service and exempt from all liabilities. Tempted       by these great advantages, many young men assemble of their own motion to       receive their training, many are sent by parents and relatives. Report says       that in the schools of the Druids they learn by heart a great number of verses,       and therefore some persons remain twenty years under training'. </strong></p>
<p><strong>'They do not think it proper to commit these utterances to       writing, although in all other matters and in their public and private accounts       they make use of Greek characters. I believe that they have adopted the practice       for two reasons- that they do not wish the rule to become common property,       nor those who learn the rule to rely on writing and so neglect the cultivation       of memory; and, in fact, it does usually happen that the assistance of writing       tends to relax the diligence of the student and the action of memory...They       also lecture on the stars in their motion, the magnitude       of the Earth and its divisions, on natural history, on the power and       government of God; and instruct the youth in these subjects' <em>(see De Ballo       Gallico, VII, 15, 16.).</em></strong></p>
<p>Historian, Isabel Hill Elder  writes, <strong>'The students at these       colleges numbered at times sixty thousand of the youth and young nobility       of Britain and Gaul. Caesar comments on the fact that the Gauls sent their       youth to Britain to be educated...It required twenty years to master the complete       circle of Druidic knowledge. Natural philosophy, astronomy,       mathematics, geometry, medicine, jurisprudence, poetry and oratory       were all proposed and taught-natural philosophy and       astronomy with severe exactitude' (Elder refers to <em>Strabo I IV,       page 197. Caesars Comm. Lib V. Sueotonius, V Calegula. E. Campion, Accounts       of Ireland, pg. 18.).</em></strong></p>
<p>Isabel Hill Elder further writes,<strong> 'The education system       adopted by the Druids is traced to about 1800 BC when Hu Gardarn Hysicion       (Isaacson), or Hu the Mighty, led the first colony of Cymri into Britain from       Defrobane, where Constantinople now stands'.</strong> </p>
<p>Further commenting on Hu       Gardarn Hysicion, Isabel Hill Elder writes that he, <strong>'is commemorated in       Welsh archaeology as having made poetry the vehicle of memory'.</strong> Elsewhere       she writes, he <strong>'is said to have mnemonically systematized the wisdom of       the ancients...'.</strong> She goes on to say,<strong> 'The published compositions of       the Druids and Bards form but a very small portion of the extant remains of       their works. The Myvyrian MSS. alone, now in the British Museum, amount to       47 volumes of poetry, in 1600 pages, besides about 2000 epigrammatic stanzas.       Also in the same collection are 53 volumes of prose, in about 15,300 pages,       containing many curious documents on various subjects...' <em>(see Celt, Druid       and Culdee, pages 54 &amp; 55).</em></strong></p>
<p>With the testimony of Julius Caesar ringing in our ears, lets see how the druids would have used the dodecahedron artefacts as <em><strong>"memory"</strong></em>devices for mathematically encoding astronomical cycles,<em><strong> ("the stars in their motion")</strong></em>, navigation systems <em><strong>("the …</strong></em></p></div>

    <h2>htmx 1.0.0 Release</h2>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/htmx.org@1.0.0/">1.0.0 release</a> of htmx.</p>
<p>htmx is now mature enough that I can recommend it as a general replacement for intercooler.js
projects.  I <strong>don't</strong> think there is a strong reason to port an existing intercooler project to
htmx.  I have several large intercooler apps and will not be moving them over any time soon. I can, however, recommend using htmx over intercooler for new projects.</p>
<p>htmx is a different sort of javascript library.  It is an HTML &amp; hypertext-oriented reply to the current dominance of javascript-based SPA libraries.  It is a response to Tom MacWright's question:
<a href="https://macwright.com/2020/10/28/if-not-spas.html">"If not SPAs, What?"</a>.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://htmx.org/">homepage says</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> be able to make HTTP requests?</li>
<li>Why should only <code>click</code> &amp; <code>submit</code> events trigger them?</li>
<li>Why should only GET &amp; POST be available?</li>
<li>Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML-oriented web development was abandoned not because hypertext was a bad idea, but rather because HTML didn't have sufficient expressive power.  htmx aims to fix that &amp; allows you to implement <a href="https://htmx.org/examples/">many common modern web UI patterns</a> using the original hypertext model of the web.</p>
<h3>History &amp; Thanks</h3>
<p>htmx began life as <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a> back in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/intercooler-js/commit/62d3dbdb5c056ee866aba3575e148de649fc3efe">2013</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/commit/e38dea64dd1065003a0e833d7b469d24e6bc2919">april</a> of this year I began work on a jQuery-indepenent &amp; improved version of intercoolerjs, renamed
to htmx.  I chose to rename the library because, in working on intercooler, I had come to appreciate that intercooler &amp; htmx were completing HTML as a hypertext rather than just some funky, idiosyncratic javascript libraries.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/releases/tag/v0.0.1">May</a> htmx reached 0.0.1.  Soon thereafter I had the good fortune of being contacted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_pylo">Ben Croker</a>
who was interested in htmx as a base for his new reactive library, <a href="https://putyourlightson.com/plugins/sprig">Sprig</a>.  Ben was willing to be an early adopter of htmx and pushed the library along
much faster than it would have gone otherwise.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to the have help and feedback from many contributors in <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/graphs/contributors">Github</a> and on <a href="https://htmx.org/discord">Discord</a>.  I'd like to thank, in particular, <a href="https://github.com/benpate">Ben Pate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rschroll">Robert Schroll</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/jreviews">Alejandro Schmeichler</a> for contributing code as well as new ideas and discussions.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="https://devmode.fm/">Devmode.fm</a> for having me on to <a href="https://devmode.fm/episodes/dynamic-html-with-htmx">talk about htmx</a> and for cleaning up all my "uhhs" and "umms".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/jsampson">Justin Sampson</a>, who took a lot of time to explain REST &amp; HATEOAS to me and how intercooler (and now htmx) fit into that model for web development.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I bumped the version number :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <h2 id="i">I</h2><p>I, like many other people, have discovered that it is almost impossible to think seriously without writing. Writing clarifies and sharpens your thoughts in a way that is superior to merely articulating them in a conversation. It allows you to look at your ideas more objectively, almost as if they were from another person. You can then examine them and think about if what you have written down is really true.</p><p>However, more often than discovering that your ideas are wrong, you will discover something different: that you do not know what you think. Sure, you have some vague idea, and you believe that there is a chain of reasoning that leads to a certain conclusion. But what you will discover is that this chain of reasoning is mostly not existent. At best, it has many holes and maybe leads not where you think it does. This discovery is, of course, very unpleasant and sometimes even painful. In a sense, you have lied to yourself by thinking you have thought through this specific topic when, in reality, you have only copied the opinion of someone else.</p><p>This process requires an immense amount of honesty because nobody likes to feel stupid. Either you do not know what you think, in which case you feel stupid. Or it turns out that what you believed to be your opinion does not really make sense, is logically inconsistent, and mostly copied from someone else, in which case you feel stupid as well. However, the reward for all this exhausting work is clarity and simplicity. You now possess a chain of reasoning where you have looked as carefully as you can for holes and problems. The next step is to let others examine your reasoning—publishing.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I am happy when others enjoy my work and when I can offer a new perspective, but for me, the criticism of my ideas is the most rewarding part of publishing. This is why I recently wrote:</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't write to criticize others; write to be criticized by others.</p>— Sven Schnieders (@SvenSchnieders) <a href="https://twitter.com/SvenSchnieders/status/1303074445003812864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>If you care about being less wrong tomorrow than you are today, you have to take this extreme attitude towards criticism. It will show in your writings and in the way you express your ideas. If you want to be perceived as smart and right, you will articulate your ideas in a moderate way so that others agree with it. (This is one of the main problems I have with contemporary intellectuals who always seem to take the middle ground.) If you are searching for truth, you will articulate the most extreme and radical consequences of your ideas, precisely because others will disagree with them and tell you where your ideas are wrong.</p><p>A good example is a discussion about the distribution of intelligence (not IQ) that I often have with my dad. To crudely summarize the discussion: he believes most people are too stupid to understand complex ideas; for him, this even applies to people who do not recognize the importance of free speech (the real free speech without the “but”). On the other hand, I think that the difference between people’s minds is mostly quantitative (speed and memory) and that almost everyone can understand complex ideas if they take the time and put in the effort; for me, this even applies to, e.g., quantum mechanics.</p><p>I do not want to get into the discussion (that’s a different essay, and it is more nuanced than I portrayed it here), but note how radically different our positions are. It is because we both put forward the most extreme consequence of our theories. If he or I cared about finding a consensus and about looking correct, we could have used different examples: he could have said that people cannot understand complex systems like capitalism, and I could have said that people are capable of understanding even classical physics.</p><p>Notice that the disagreement looks way less severe using these examples. Some people might even argue that understanding how capitalism works is more difficult than understanding classical physics. It feels as if we are way closer to a compromise or to finding a common ground. But in reality, were are just further away from finding the truth because our disagreement is not as clear and obvious as it could be, which leads to worse criticism.</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>This way of expressing ideas can sometimes be perceived as rude because, in contrast to most other people, you are not searching for consensus but for the truth. However, it is not a form of arrogance to express the most extreme consequences of your ideas; it is a form of intellectual honesty. In this way, your ideas are widely open to criticism, and you are therefore more likely to learn something. You are also more likely to look stupid, but that is a price you must be willing to pay.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>The inherent fuzziness of conversations makes it difficult to notice gaps in your understanding and reasoning. This applies both to your conversation partner and to yourself.</p><p>Having a conversation with someone else about your ideas is only superior to writing about them under two conditions. First, if you have already thought about your ideas on the topic a lot and have carefully examined your chain of reasoning, which, as I have already explained, is best done in writing. And second, if the other person is smart, has thought about the topic a lot as well, and values truth over consensus. If, and only if, both of these conditions are met, a conversation can be more fruitful in sharpening your ideas than writing about them. There are other advantages to conversations with regards to creativity, thought-provoking impulses, and inspiration, but for thinking deeply about a topic, writing is superior to a conversation.</p><h2 id="v">V</h2><p>Anyone who reads books that are commonly known as <em>the classics</em> will be somewhat discouraged from publishing their writing because these people were so smart. Every idea you come up with has probably been expressed better by someone else (most likely even by Plato because, as some say, <a href="https://www.age-of-the-sage.org/philosophy/footnotes_plato.html">all of western philosophy is merely a series of footnotes to his works</a>). Put differently by Allen Farrington:</p><blockquote>“The classics are classic because those people were a lot smarter than us and we kinda wish they were still around telling the rest of us idiots what to do.”</blockquote><p>Although I whole hardheartedly agree with this sentiment and might one day decide to write up my thoughts on why I think we are “stupider” than our ancestors, it does not have to be demotivating. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recognizing that our contemporary intellectuals are, let’s just say, “not up for the task” should be a motivation for everyone else. I think the question,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have the smart people always been this stupid?</p>— Heather E Heying (@HeatherEHeying) <a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherEHeying/status/1327124783365021696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>should be answered with a resounding no. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, being mostly unworthy of the great works of the past. But it does not mean that we cannot make ourselves worthy. You (and I) may not possess the courage of Nietzsche or the wisdom of Plato, but it is our responsibility to breathe new life into their thoughts—to think them further—and since they are not around, there is no point in being discouraged.</p><h2 id="vi">VI</h2><p>Do not compare yourself to the classics; they are dead and cannot solve our problems for us. If you need confidence, compare yourself to contemporary intellectuals, and you will see that society needs all the help it can get. Remember, “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in_the_land_of_the_blind,_the_one-eyed_man_is_king">in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,</a>” and one thing is certain: there are very few two-eyed men left.</p><p>Every time I get disappointed in my ability to think and articulate my thoughts, which happens frequently, I look at contemporary intellectuals and remember Bukowski’s words:</p><blockquote>“I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good; and I’m still not so good, but they’re still very bad.”</blockquote><h2 id="vii">VII</h2><p>This essay is my way of saying: Start writing! You will learn as much about the topic as about yourself. You will be shocked by how often you trick yourself into falsely thinking that you have understood something. You will write and think, “Oh, is this why I think that? I didn’t know that.” </p><p>The process is exciting, challenging, scary, and sometimes painful, but above all, it is worth it. And one day, you and I might be able to read the great works of the past and feel that we have honored their achievements by keeping their ideas alive, and maybe we have even managed to think some of them further.</p><p>Thank you for reading my essay.</p>

			<p>Published in <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Tea-Leaves/Yukio-Mishima-in-the-21st-century" target="_blank">Nikkei Asia 23/11/2020</a></p>
<p>Can you imagine best-selling novelist Haruki Murakami leading a coup attempt against Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga? Or Booker Prize winner Ian McEwan taking a top general hostage in a British army base and inciting a rebellion against Boris Johnson’s government? Or any of the legions of writers and artists who regularly hammered President Donald Trump on social media choosing to die for their cause?</p>
<p>Probably not, but that would be the modern equivalent of what happened on Nov. 25, 1970, when the brilliant Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima and four accomplices invaded the office of the commander of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces, called on his troops to topple the government of Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, and then committed <em>seppuku</em>, or ritual disembowelment (vulgarly known as <em>hara-kiri</em>).<a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg" alt="NARMishima" width="460" height="612" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-460x612.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-768x1022.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-395x525.jpg 395w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima-436x580.jpg 436w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NARMishima.jpg 1503w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a></p>
<p>Mishima had been nominated three times for the Nobel Prize for Literature, but he was not just a writer. He was a major celebrity in Japan, the first to be described as a <em>supasuta</em> (superstar) by the media, and one of the best-known Japanese writers abroad. In the late 1960s the magazine <em>Heibon Punch</em> nominated him the “coolest male” in Japan in its “Mr. Dandy” awards, ahead of movie star Toshiro Mifune and baseball hero Shigeo Nagashima.</p>
<p>Since his shocking suicide, establishment Japan has preferred not to dwell on the “Mishima incident,” and only ultra-rightwing groups have seemed happy to mark the various anniversaries of his death. For the 50th anniversary, though, the vibe has been different. A few days ago, I managed to catch <em>Mishima: The Last Debate</em>, a documentary that uses recently discovered footage of a face-off between Mishima and hundreds of radical students during violent street protests in 1969.</p>
<p>The film was released in March, but was still screening in Tokyo’s central Shibuya district. I half-expected the audience to be dominated by elderly rightists in combat gear. I was wrong. There were women in their 20s and 30s wearing designer masks, some students, ordinary looking couples and solitary intellectual types. Although the film was advertised as a tense confrontation between violence-prone right and violence left-wing groups, the debate was mostly respectful on both sides, with Mishima’s wit drawing gales of laughter from the students and, indeed, the cinema audience.</p>
<p>Other films about Mishima have been made this century. The late Koji Wakamatsu, a radical left sympathizer once known as the “Kurosawa of pink [erotic] movies,” directed <em>11.25: The Day He Chose His Own Fate</em>&nbsp;(2012). This biopic offers a straightforward factual account of Mishima’s last months. There is also a film version of <em>Spring Snow</em>, the first and best volume in his <em>Sea of Fertility</em>&nbsp;tetralogy.</p>
<p>His books are still popular too. Mishima wrote intense, heavyweight novels conveying his philosophical ideas, but also less serious fare as entertainments for the mass market. Interestingly it is the latter that have been doing particularly well these days. A light novel called <em>Yukio Mishima’s Letter Writing Class</em>&nbsp;has consistently ranked in Amazon Japan’s Top 10 for Japanese literature. &nbsp;Another entertainment called <em>Life for Sale</em>&nbsp;was the top seller of 2016 in the Japanese literature department of Kinokuniya, Japan’s largest bookshop, with total sales topping 250,000.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-460x345.jpg" alt="Mishima display at Maruzen bookshop (photo: Giles Murray)" width="460" height="345" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-460x345.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-700x525.jpg 700w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Mish2-773x580.jpg 773w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a> Mishima display at Maruzen bookshop (photo: Giles Murray)
</p><p>At least 30 novels and essays have been translated into English, including <em>Life for Sale</em>. There are also two more biographies. <em>Persona</em>&nbsp;is a meticulously researched doorstopper by Naoki Inose, novelist and ex-governor of Tokyo, and Hiroaki Sato. <em>Yukio Mishima</em>&nbsp;is by British author Damian Flanagan.</p>
<p>Another British Mishima enthusiast was the rock star David Bowie, who appears to have planned his own death in 2016 with Mishima-like artistic precision. Bowie painted a portrait of Mishima, which he hung on the wall of his Berlin apartment in the late 1970s. In the 1990s, he bought a bronze bust of Mishima by British sculptor Sir Eduardo Paolozzi at Sotheby’s.&nbsp; More recently, he referred to the opening of <em>Spring Snow</em>&nbsp;in his 2013 album <em>The Next Day</em>: “Then we saw Mishima’s dog / Trapped between the rocks / Blocking the waterfall.”</p>
<p>The accent on the lighter, more humorous side of Mishima may have contributed to what seems to be a subconscious reassessment within Japan. There is also the fact that some of his political stances — on validating the constitutional status of the Self-Defense Forces, on protecting Japan’s traditional culture — no longer seem extreme.</p>
<p>Another impression came to me forcefully while watching the debate between Mishima and the radical students who were occupying the Tokyo University lecture hall. The cinema audience was agog at the huge moral issues that were being argued in a way that could never happen in today’s world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR.jpg"><img src="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-460x339.jpg" alt="Mishima engages with student Masahiko Akuta, now a respected theatrical impresario and actor" width="460" height="339" srcset="http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-460x339.jpg 460w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-768x566.jpg 768w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-700x516.jpg 700w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR-787x580.jpg 787w, http://www.petertasker.asia/site/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MishimaNAR.jpg 1447w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></a> Mishima engages with student Masahiko Akuta, now a respected theatrical impresario and actor
</p><p>In his much-misunderstood book, <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>,&nbsp; Francis Fukuyama uses the ideas of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to speculate about what kind of landscape the post-historical “last men” will inhabit, once liberal democracy has triumphed everywhere. The answer is a world devoid of great art, struggle, risk, wisdom and self-knowledge. The last men, Fukuyama posits, “will be concerned above all for personal health and safety … content to sit at home congratulating themselves on their own broadmindedness and lack of fanaticism.”</p>
<p>Mishima’s dislike of Anglo-Saxon liberal democracy came from Nietzsche. According to Flanagan, “Mishima’s bond with Nietzsche was described by Mishima’s father after his son’s death as of an intensity beyond imagination.”</p>
<p>Mishima committed <em>seppuku</em> just 25 years after the end of World War II, much too soon for him to escape being dismissed as an unbalanced reactionary throwback to the age of militarism. Fifty years on, the last man is here, placidly enjoying his lockdown thanks to Zoom, Netflix and Uber Eats, totally comfortable with the prospect of a future controlled by artificial intelligence and big data.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need a Mishima to shock us out of our complacency.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">We left off at booting an ARM Linux virtual machine, and installing &amp; running Docker inside it. This works fine and allows you run containers like for instance a Postgres database. They can expose their ports and instead of connecting to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">localhost:5432</code> on the host, you connect to your VM’s IP address, for instance <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.8:5432</code>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now in case you’re not aware, Docker is actually a service that exposes an API over HTTP and when you run <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> commands, they control the service via these API requests on a local socket. You’ve probably seen the reference to <code data-preserve-html-node="true">unix:///var/run/docker.sock</code> at times.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">What that means is that it’s possible to direct your <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> client to talk to a Docker service over the network, and that’s what we can do as well to enable “regular” docker commands to work with a locally running “Linux Docker VM”.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Incidentally, that’s exactly what “Docker for Mac” is doing under the hood: it is actually a <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://github.com/moby/hyperkit">VM based on Apple’s Hypervisor framework</a> which hosts Docker, not your Mac itself.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Installing “Docker for Mac”</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to get started, we need to obtain the Docker client app. I migrated my existing setup from a Time Machine backup and therefore had Docker installed from the start. If you need to install from scratch, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/">installing the client binaries</a> is probably the easiest way to get started.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Assuming you have a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker</code> binary to hand, you’re good to go. The way we’ll set up the connection is via a “docker context” and all this is <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1332271974719090688?s=21">thanks to a tip by Johannes Weiss</a>.</p>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up SSH in virtual machine</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">First though, we need to configure to connect to our VM via SSH. Install the SSH server:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and copy your public key to the <code data-preserve-html-node="true">ubuntu</code> user’s <code data-preserve-html-node="true">authorized_keys</code> for password-less access.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">In order to connect to the VM, you’ll need to find its IP address (which is on a <code data-preserve-html-node="true">192.168.64.0</code> network if you’ve followed along from the previous blog post).</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Our image comes without <code data-preserve-html-node="true">net-tools</code>, so we’ll install these first:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">sudo apt install net-tools</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and then run</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">which should yield the following</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true"><a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7d081f081309083d081f08130908">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:<span>~</span>$ ifconfig <span>|</span> grep 192.168
        inet 192.168.64.8  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.64.255</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">With all this out of the way, we can test the connection from the host:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">ssh <a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f08592859e8485b0c1c9c2dec1c6c8dec6c4dec8">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code></pre>

<figure data-preserve-html-node="true"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/finestructure-public-images/posts/ssh-login.png"></figure>

<h2 data-preserve-html-node="true">Setting up a Docker context</h2>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">The remaining steps are simple. We create a Docker context:</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="afdacddac1dbdaef9e969d819e999781999b8197">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span></code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">and tell Docker to use it</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context use myvm</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Now all docker commands are targeting the virtual machine, just like they do in Docker for Mac.</p>

<pre data-preserve-html-node="true"><code data-preserve-html-node="true">❯ docker context create myvm --docker <span>"host=ssh://<a href="https://finestructure.co/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d5a0b7a0bba1a095e4ece7fbe4e3edfbe3e1fbed">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
myvm
Successfully created context <span>"myvm"</span>
<span>~</span>
❯ docker context use myvm
myvm
<span>~</span>
❯ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
<span>~</span>
❯ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker<span>!</span>
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the <span>"hello-world"</span> image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</code></pre>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">You can find out more about <code data-preserve-html-node="true">docker context</code> in the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/context/working-with-contexts">online documentation</a>.</p>

<p data-preserve-html-node="true">Bear in mind that this setup does not come with the convenience of Docker for Mac’s bridge networking or support for volumes – but surely these aren’t far off.</p>

November 27, 2020 | https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Not retaining enough</a> is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.</p><p>There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but <strong>the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content</strong>. During the past few years I’ve noticed:</p><ul><li><p>The more seamless the acquisition &amp; ingestion, the more engaged I am with the content</p></li><li><p>Insights are just as likely to be found in a 400-page book as in a 40-minute podcast</p></li><li><p>Notes and their subsequent review are essential for long-term retention</p></li><li><p>Recommendations from other humans are as good, if not better, than algorithmic suggestions</p></li></ul><p>In the rest of this post I attempt to explain the digital tools I wish existed, and how the the currently available tools do not suffice. What are also probably lacking are my <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">habits and workflows</a> around this - but I’m looking at tools specifically here.</p><h2 id="queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">Queue management for inbound digital content&nbsp;<a href="#queue-management-for-inbound-digital-content">#</a></h2><p>Where to begin? Probably the most common problem I see myself and other people dealing with is processing the incoming deluge of articles to read and videos to watch. This isn’t all personal recommendations - it encompasses any and all content I think my future self would appreciate me consuming. A list of issues, roughly by order of appearance:</p><ul><li><p>Content (or links to it) arrive from a variety of sources including text messages from friends, email conversations, tweetstorms and replies, references in books, suggestions in real-world conversations, and more.</p></li><li><p>Every book, article, post, or tweet has the potential to lead to more content.</p></li><li><p>Content is published in a variety of formats including but not limited to images, sound files, videos, Google Drive docs, diagrams, long-form paywalled articles, PDFs, powerpoint presentations, and base 64 encoded blobs.</p></li><li><p>I have little visibility into required time investment and foundational context until I’ve opened it and started thinking about it. Should I sit down with a pen and paper to read this or can I skim it while waiting for my coffee?</p></li><li><p>Learning, work, news, and entertainment all have different priorities in my life (roughly in that order).</p></li><li><p>I would like to batch process content in different “streams” regardless of where they are stored. For example: I have two hours, let me work through interesting text content my friends sent me last week. Or: show me all the interesting/relevant videos I’ve queued over the past month.</p></li><li><p>I’m not always connected to a stable internet connection.</p></li><li><p>If it’s a long piece of content I want my position saved reliably so I can resume at a later point.</p></li><li><p>I often want it in a different format than the one it was originally published in (audio → text, text → audio, pdf → ebook). Automated conversion works but is cumbersome. Listening to text articles requires sending them to a special app and converting articles to ebooks is annoying and loses a lot of formatting and navigation.</p></li><li><p>I love to respond to a person’s recommendation - preferably before they’ve forgotten why they sent me it in the first place.</p></li><li><p>I’d like a centralized history of content tied to my notes and annotations in case I want to find it again later. It feels like every week I’m speaking with someone and I remember a blog post I read a few months ago they might find relevant … or was it a Reddit post? Can I find it my history? Oh no, it’s been replaced with <code>[deleted]</code> … find an archived copy… rinse and repeat.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/icon_swap.png"><figcaption>Relevant XKCD, as is tradition</figcaption></figure><p>Following my curiosity feels like chasing a caffeinated bunny around while real understanding requires time, perspective, and reflection. The internet makes the former much easier - so I find myself constantly balancing the two. Additionally, my energy and attention levels vary throughout the day and it’s far easier to just open Twitter rather than continue reading a long-form article I started on my laptop two days ago. Too often I default to the lower-friction one.</p><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a></p><h2 id="a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">A universal book log, recommendation &amp; sharing system&nbsp;<a href="#a-universal-book-log-recommendation-sharing-system">#</a></h2><p>I love exploring other peoples’ reading lists. Here’s <a href="https://jon.bo/books">my own</a>. I find everyone keeps their reading lists in different formats on different platforms. Plaintext lists are nice but hard to parse. Spreadsheets are easy to parse but a pain to manage. Third-party services aren’t interoperable, require logins, and are not future-proof.</p><p>Part of the problem here is <a href="https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm">metadata is hard</a>. Someone has to sit there and fill out the author, title, subtitle, summary, page count - and they’re probably not going to do it for free. Amazon is a good at it but <a href="https://stallman.org/amazon.html#publishing">is hostile to publishers</a>. Goodreads has much potential but <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/almost-everything-about-goodreads-is-broken-662e424244d5">seems to have stagnated</a>. Linking to the book’s Wikipedia entry would be my preference but very few books have an entry.</p><p>Whatever this tool for managing my ever-growing reading list will be, it should:</p><ul><li><p>Let me compare my reading list with another to see overlap. I find this a wonderful way to spark conversation and find common interests.</p></li><li><p>Allow me to tag books instead of placing them into static lists (think clusters or tag clouds).</p></li><li><p>Be tied to my highlights, annotations, and bookmarks in a non-proprietary, searchable, and shareable format. Make them public if I want to.</p></li><li><p>Save context on where and when I found this book: why I thought it was important to read, when I read it, what I wrote down while reading it, and what other content I discovered through it.</p></li><li><p>Let me query this tool like a relational database. For example: show me all books about scaling startups recommended by people I follow on Twitter or by people they follow. The current Twitter search makes me feel like I’m using a government site created before I myself even knew what a computer was.</p></li><li><p>Help me <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kmch6T2YscMyLFJD9/rational-reading-thoughts-on-prioritizing-books">deal with prioritization</a>. My reading list is a mess and I can’t be alone. Are certain books better read before others? Prerequisites? Could three of them be replaced with one? What are the other books by the this author? Are they worth reading too? Why exactly did I think reading this 800 page book was relevant when I added it? <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/health-fitness/the-checklist-manifesto/">Is 80% of the content attainable from a blog post?</a> Where is that post? Has someone in my network written a rebuttal to the ideas in this book? The list goes on and on.</p></li><li><p>Provide relevant suggestions with the typical recommender approach based on what people interested in the same topics also enjoyed reading and learning from.</p></li></ul><p>Honorable Mentions: None :(</p><h2 id="intelligent-pdf-viewers-ebook-readers-audiobook-podcast-players">Intelligent PDF viewers, eBook readers, audiobook &amp; podcast players&nbsp;<a href="#intelligent-pdf-viewers-ebook-readers-audiobook-podcast-players">#</a></h2><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5aa98bca712e33bc729c180c9a588f4d5ac7e9af/c5011/digital-tools/ebook-concept.png"><figcaption>Functionality I want in my document reader</figcaption></figure><p>Reading is incredible and I love my Kindle. But eBooks today are just a step above OCR’ing a book and slapping on a few basic features which have existed for 30+ years. While I’m reading an eBook I want to:</p><ul><li><p>Have relevant illustrations, graphs, and tables appear for duration of their mentions so I don’t have to flip back and forth between them.</p></li><li><p>See glossary terms and their definitions which appear on this page. Highlighting and searching a term is great but the author may have added important context to the glossary definition.</p></li><li><p>View popular annotations and highlights across <strong>all</strong> mediums - not just by other readers who own an Amazon Kindle readers and purchased this book version and also happened to highlight it enough times. A quote was referenced in 300 blog articles? A two sentence excerpt retweeted 50,000 times? You bet I want to know!</p></li><li><p>Follow referenced information easily. You cited a paper - great, let’s look at the footnotes. Oh, the full reference is in the back of the book. Online list of citations? Of course not! Drop a bookmark, navigate to the back of the book, pull out my laptop, find the paper. Of course, a paywall. Grab a snack. Acquire the PDF. Search for keywords to try to find the referenced information. Sigh, 2019.</p></li><li><p>Not be hindered by the DRM system. Copyright is important and I want to support authors but it’s insane to me all these content licenses I’m acquiring can’t be donated to a library upon account closure. Yes, legal DRM-free eBooks exist but they aren’t without their own issues.</p></li><li><p>Seamlessly switch between devices and formats while retaining my position. Something like Whispersync (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000827761">a neat idea</a> but come on, I’m not made of money. Also, see above points).</p></li><li><p>Let me use a digital or physical keyboard instead of an e-ink keyboard to type my annotations. A possibility here is a companion app, which feels like a notes app but ties my notes to their location/text in the book I’m reading.</p></li></ul><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7bc95c0c51628e5ba06ddb7e688a58c600e503c8/81599/digital-tools/audiobook-player.png"><figcaption>What I want my audiobook player to look like</figcaption></figure><p>Most of these points above also apply to my experience listening to podcasts, audiobooks, and watching Youtube videos and interviews. I find myself wishing I could:</p><ul><li><p>Navigate them more comfortably. Both Libby and Audible leave much to be desired in terms of navigation. Finding a quote I remember hearing to three days ago is basically blindly stumbling around - and I lose my current spot too. Seeing a list of chapter numbers for the book I’m <strong>listening to</strong> has been helpful a grand total of 0 times. And how cool would it be to drop a bookmark from my bluetooth-connected headphones as I’m biking down a street.</p></li><li><p>View an auto-generated transcript of a podcast as I’m listening to it. It should have easy-to-follow links to references to other podcasts, media, books and support searching for key terms. YouTube already transcribes all of their videos and Google Meet now generates live captions as we’re talking - why can’t we do something similar with podcast apps?</p></li></ul><p>Honorable Mentions: <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>, <a href="https://www.weavatools.com/">Weava</a>, <a href="https://www.descript.com/">Descript</a>, <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a>, <a href="https://getpolarized.io/#features">Polar</a></p><h2 id="a-centralized-search-interface-for-my-digital-brain-memex">A centralized search interface for my digital brain (memex)&nbsp;<a href="#a-centralized-search-interface-for-my-digital-brain-memex">#</a></h2><p>I want to be able to open an interface, type three words, and instantly see results from everything my digital self has interacted with.

What makes it stand out in the LISP family?</strong></h2><p id="b428">Let’s distinguish “Racket the language” and “Racket the project”.</p><p id="f2e2">The Racket language is a general-purpose, Scheme-like language with an especially rich set of constructs for extending the language — even by Scheme standards. Racket includes support for writing quick-and-dirty macros, but it also supports nice macros with a good error checking that avoid surprising errors created in the expanded code. The close integration of macros and modules, an enforced phase separation between run-time and compile-time code, and the `#lang` mechanism for selecting the surface syntax all distinguish Racket from other Lisp variants.</p><p id="d48e">Even the main language Racket is written in a simpler language, and that is written in an even more simple language. This tower of languages makes development easier. You can look under the hood and see all the internal languages, or just ignore all of them and get a nice high level language.</p><p id="36f0">Less prominent, but also as important in practice for building language abstractions and composing them into large systems, are Racket’s run-time constructs: first-class control with continuation marks, custodians for simple and reliable task termination, reachability-based memory accounting, message-based parallelism via places, and Concurrent ML-style constructs for event-driven programs. Many of these constructs need support at lower levels of the runtime system, but then they can be used to build a wide variety of languages and libraries that mesh well.</p><p id="cb77">The Racket project synthesizes research, production, and education efforts toward the overall language-building goal. The idea of “A Programmable Programming Language” serves along those directions, from building student-friendly learning environments to domain-specific languages in application to pushing the frontiers of language design and implementation.</p><p id="a39d">The main page is <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" rel="noopener">https://racket-lang.org/</a></p><h2 id="47bc"><strong>What does it mean that you can write your own language?</strong></h2><p id="8534">For example, when you install Racket, it comes with 20 or 30 additional languages. (I’m not sure if someone has counted all of them.)</p><p id="adb8">There are a few “Student” languages that are designed for students. They are less powerful but have more compile time checks to detect common errors in beginners. And they have different levels so once you master one, you can use the next one that includes more features.</p><p id="e7f1">Another language is Typed Racket, that adds types to the Racket expressions, so it refuses to compile unless the types check. And it also uses the type information to optimize the code, so the compilation is slower, but the generated code can be faster.</p><p id="b5fa">There are languages that implement the version of Scheme in R5RS and R6RS and many of the SRFI. And you can install a package that adds the version in the R7RS-small.</p><p id="8dd3">And there are also more different languages with a very different syntax like a complete implementation of Algol 60.</p><p id="d422">All these languages share the same backend and you can call the libraries written in one language from any of the other languages that are included in the distribution, the additional languages you can download as packages, or the languages you create.</p><p id="7932"><strong>What’s the difference between Racket and Scheme?</strong></p><p id="f375">Racket started out as a Scheme implementation, and we would still call it “a Scheme.” Even though it does not fit a Scheme standard, it’s obviously derived from Scheme. There are many specific differences, such as the fact that `cons` always creates an immutable pair in Racket, but the main difference is philosophy: Scheme is meant to be a small language that gives you just enough to express lots of things. Racket is meant to be a big language, and while it gives you the same core pieces (and more) that can express lots of things, it also codifies the way many things are done to enable more cooperating libraries and languages.</p><h2 id="0256"><strong>What is Chez Scheme, how is it different from other Scheme implementations?</strong></h2><p id="1fb3">Chez Scheme is one of the oldest Scheme implementations, and its evolution informed many parts of the Scheme standard through R6RS. (Racket’s influence on the Scheme standard, in contrast, is limited to aspects of the R6RS library design.) Chez Scheme is a relatively small language, but like all instantiations of Scheme, the implementation provides a lot more than the standard specifies.</p><p id="3c1c">Chez Scheme’s biggest claim to fame is its performance. It has always been among the best-performing Scheme implementations. Its object-tagging and allocation regime, its hybrid stack–heap implementations of continuations, and its compiler structure all remain state-of-the-art, even in 2020.</p><p id="3095">For most of its existence, Chez Scheme was a proprietary, closed-source implementation, but it became open source in mid-2016. As it happens, we started considering a new Racket reimplementation around the start of 2017.</p><h2 id="54ea"><strong>Why did you choose Chez Scheme over other Schemes to rebuild Racket?</strong></h2><p id="db07">The biggest weakness of the Racket BC (“before Chez”) implementation are its back-end compiler structure, its inefficient internal calling conventions (over-adapted to C), and its poor implementation of first-class continuations. Those are exactly the strengths of Chez Scheme. Furthermore, Racket’s evaluation model was always closely aligned with Chez Scheme, such as the emphasis on interactive evaluation and compilation.</p><p id="d9a4">It was clear up front that Chez Scheme lacked significant features that Racket needs, such as support for continuation marks and reachability-based memory accounting. However, the high quality of the Chez Scheme design and implementation, in contrast to old Racket’s implementation, made adapting Chez Scheme more appealing than retrofitting Racket’s old implementation further.</p><h2 id="28e7"><strong>Why reimplement with Chez Scheme to reduce the C part instead of implementing the C stuff in Racket?</strong></h2><p id="2658">Mostly, we did reimplement the C stuff in Racket. The I/O subsystem, the concurrency subsystem (which includes the scheduler for “green” threads, Concurrent ML-style events, and custodians), and the regexp matcher were all rewritten in Racket. Those pieces followed the rewrite of the macro expander in Racket. Other things that needed to be moved out of C, such as the compiler and the extensive support for numbers that Racket inherited from Scheme, were already written in Scheme in Chez Scheme’s implementation.</p><p id="b995">A big part of the process was to understand what to implement in Racket, what in Chez Scheme, and what new layers to introduce in translation. This work and reorganization benefits other Racket implementation efforts, such as Pycket and RacketScript.</p><h2 id="de40"><strong>Besides improving maintainability, what are the advantages of building Racket with CS over C?</strong></h2><p id="4952">With the exception of the garbage collector and similar low-level parts of the runtime system, much of Racket’s implementation benefits from higher-level abstractions. Writing a macro expander in C was a particularly poor choice, since higher-level abstractions obviously make tree manipulations easier, but the same reasons apply for the I/O layer or numeric primitives. Even the garbage collector in [the Racket variant of] Chez Scheme is now half implemented by a specification and compiler that are written in Scheme.</p><p id="60db">The other big advantage is that the Racket community has a lot of Racket programmers, not C programmers. It’s easier to convince a fan of Racket to look at some code in Racket or Chez Scheme and try to find some bug or a new feature to contribute. The people that like to read and write code in C are probably making contributions to a C compiler.</p><h2 id="e706"><strong>What were the most challenging parts to implement?</strong></h2><p id="971c">The most challenging part is not really one part, but the overall scale. Racket is a big language, and it all has to work the same in the new implementation. That means not just getting the right result and/or a specific kind of error message, but getting results with the same or better performance characteristics. For example, if a macro generates a giant expansion that nevertheless compiles in reasonable time in Racket BC, then it needs to compile in reasonable time in Racket CS.</p><p id="c985">When it comes to specific pieces that we had to implement, perhaps the most challenging were adding type reconstruction to the compiler, adding support for continuation marks, allowing record values to act as procedures, reimplementing Racket’s I/O, and upgrading Chez Scheme’s …</p></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody"> <p>What’s the midpoint between 0 and infinity? Well the answer differs depending on whether you are asking a mathematician, philosopher, or a Ruby developer. I’m not a mathematician or a philosopher, but I am a Ruby developer, so I can tell you than 1.5 is the midpoint between 0 and infinity.</p>  <p><a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Range.html#method-i-bsearch"><code>Range#bsearch</code></a> performs binary search within a range. For example, lets use it to find the first integer that’s larger than 42 (which is 43) and see the values it inspects to find it.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>
  <span>values</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>i</span>
  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The integer larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And when we run it, we get the following output:</p> <div><div><pre><code>The integer larger than 42 is: 43

</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see typical binary search behavior.</p> <p>A co-worker recently asked me about some odd behavior when we change the starting value to a float. For example, consider the following code, which is the same as the one above but the range is between 0 and <code>Float::INFINITY</code>:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>

<span>found_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>Float</span><span>::</span><span>INFINITY</span><span>).</span><span>bsearch</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>i</span><span>|</span>

  <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>42</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>"The float larger than 42 is: </span><span>#{</span><span>found_value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>"The following values were inspected:"</span>
<span>puts</span> <span>values</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We then get the following output when we run it (note that the output has been truncated because it’s too long):</p> <div><div><pre><code>The float larger than 42 is: 42.00000000000001

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The first few values we inspect in the binary search are rather odd: <code>1.5</code>, <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code>, <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code>, etc. Where do these numbers come from? To explain these values, we first have to understand how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers work.</p>  <p>Ruby floats are double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. If you don’t know the basics about how floating-point numbers are represented in memory, there are plenty of resources on the internet, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/">here’s one</a>.</p> <p>Of special interest to us is how infinity is represented in floating-point. Infinity is a special value where the exponent bits are all 1’s and the significand bits (also known as fraction or mantissa) are all 0’s.</p>  <p>Ruby’s <code>Range#bsearch</code> is implemented in a C function called <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/5512de76033773a77f686f3cb2adc849356f7674/range.c#L680"><code>range_bsearch</code></a>. There are several cases it deals with, and the one of interest is the case when either endpoint is a float. In this case, it performs a clever trick. It reads the C double type of the Ruby float endpoints as 64-bit integers (<code>int64_t</code>)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as casting the double into integer type, this is directly reading the double as a 64-bit integer. Are you confused? I sure was when I first read this code so if you are too, it’ll make more sense later on. Trust me.</p> <p>Let’s revisit how infinity is represented in floating-point. Here’s it visualized (through the help of the amazing website <a href="https://float.exposed/">float.exposed</a>). We can see that the sign is 0 (this is a positive value), all exponent bits are 1, and all significand bits are 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/infinity.png"> </figure> <p>And of course, <code>0</code> is represented in floating-point with all the bits set to 0.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/zero.png"> </figure> <p>So what if we read these bits of the endpoint as if they were integers? Then our range would be between <code>0</code> and <code>9218868437227405312</code>. What’s the midpoint of this range? It’s <code>4609434218613702656</code>. Now let’s plug this value back into <a href="https://float.exposed/0x3ff8000000000000">float.exposed</a>.</p> <figure> <img src="https://blog.peterzhu.ca/assets/ruby-range-bsearch/one_point_five.png"> </figure> <p>Oh look, it’s 1.5!</p> <p>Using this same technique, you can now find out why the binary search examines <code>1.6759759912428246e+154</code> and <code>1.5921412270130977e+77</code> after this. This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>  <p>The reason why this works is simple once you wrap your head around it. It’s because the more significant bits are always in a more significant position (than the bits to the right of it) in floating-point numbers. This is obviously true for the significand. But this is also true for the exponent because the next power of 2 can’t be reached by just increasing the significand, the exponent has to be increased. So thus a larger exponent will always mean that the floating-point number has a larger magnitude.</p> <p>Once this is true, we can see why binary search works using this technique. It works because if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are doubles and <code>x &gt; y</code>, then we have shown that <code>double_as_int64(x) &gt; double_as_int64(y)</code> is also true. This is the requirement for binary search because the values remain strictly increasing (<em>technically</em> binary search only requires monotonically increasing, but strictly increasing is a tighter guarantee than monotonically increasing).</p>  <p>Ruby’s binary search in a range uses a clever technique to perform binary search when the endpoints are doubles while maintaining a worst-case runtime of <code>O(n log n)</code>. In fact, this technique isn’t specific to Ruby and can be used in any language that uses IEEE 754 floating-point numbers.</p>  </div> </article> </div></div>]]>

    <p>As many of us have experienced during school years, late-night learning is not the most effective technique. The information might have stuck around for a short period, but just after the day of the exam, it flew away with us unable to recall it. If you would like to remember more during and after your studies, forget the last-minute learning. Using spaced repetition, a method to rehearse educational material, you will not simply earn better grades, but studying would be an overall easier process and memorized information will be available to recall later in your life.</p>

<p>The spaced repetition system is a learning technique in which the material previously learned is recalled by the learner from time to time at ever-increasing intervals. This method is based on the intermittent repetition effect on how we tend to forget information. The primary goal of the technique is to recall the material learned as infrequently as possible, just before we forget it. By approaching repetitions in this scientific way, time spent learning can be used much more efficiently.</p>
<h2>The neurological background of memorizing</h2>
<p>Learning always begins with perception, the form of how we collect information. This data travels through the nerve pathways to the place where the perception is processed, our brain. Some perceptions cause our bodies to react, which usually does not happen consciously.</p>
<p>Scientists once thought that the brain stores memories in a similar way to computers. It was later proved that the artificial approach is completely different: information is broken down into elements (bits) on the computer and is stored that way. The machines can store up to a certain amount of information on a storage device called a hard disk. If our brain would work similarly, despite having hundreds of billions of cells, our internal storage device would have filled up in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Our brains work in a rather different way: since we always store information in context it is more about capturing the contents of things. That’s why when we recall a memory, related reminiscences come to mind, like smells or the color of the paper, or what we ate for dinner during learning.</p>
<h2>What makes spaced repetition so effective?</h2>
<p>Spaced repetition technique is one of the most effective learning techniques, which you probably use even if you do not know about it. Using this method consciously makes it far superior to standard learning.</p>
<p>There are three key values it provides:</p>
<div>
<p>Delays forgetting learned information by prolonging the forget-curve.</p>
<p>Active recall helps to keep memorized information fresh (as the context layers build-up, it gets easier to remember what you have learned).</p>
<p>Spaced repetition supports long term memory, so you won’t forget the learned information even after the exam.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to get started with the spaced repetition system?</h2>
<p>To put the above in practice, try to remember a movie you’ve seen more than one time. After you’ve watched it first, you understood it well, but a few weeks later you only remembered the title and main story points. You watched it with a friend two months later, and while watching, you have realized that you can recall the story and started to watch out for certain details in the background, or the listening closer to the music. When you watched it for the third time, you probably remembered all the names, a few exact quotes, and the story details too.</p>
<p>Of course, the typical study materials are far from a movie’s excitement, however, learning it works the same. Review your documents and memorize them for the first time. After you have finished, try recalling them in a suitable way: you can write them down or simply rehearse the answers out loud. (Trying to recall it through your inner voice is not the best idea as we all tend to cheat ourselves.)</p>
<p>If you recalled it correctly, put the documents down and start another activity. After an hour try to rehearse it again, maybe using a different method. Then again in a few hours, and on the next day morning. Keep lengthening these intervals until you are ready to face the exam.</p>
<h2>Applications and websites that support you along the journey</h2>
<p>Luckily, today we have multiple choices on how to organize our studies. Different websites, along with applications, will help to study faster and also memorize for the long-term. Let’s see 5 software programs and applications utilizing the spaced repetition system!</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quizlet</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Quizlet-logo.png" alt="Quizlet logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> This is an application that you can use either through your browser or on any mobile device. With one account you can have all your data synchronized, so you can continue your studies away from the computer when it is time to repeat!</p>
<p>The basic idea of Quizlet is that you can search for subjects that already have their case sets and use those, or you can create your own “memorizing cards”. Just enter the term and the definition, and after you are ready, you can start the learning process. Quizlet is also utilized for high-level education and corporate usage, ranging from healthcare studies to Starbucks training programs.</p>
<p>The app is available for students and teachers as well. If you get the vibe of this tool and you want to support it, for a low amount of monthly payment you can also purchase Quizlet Go or Plus for wider and advanced toolkits to create enhanced study sets.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> After creating or choosing your flashcard set, you can start to memorize the information. When you feel ready, you can choose how to check your knowledge. First is the “Learning” phase: Quizlet will show you the term and you will have to answer it from multiple choices or you will have to type it from memory - and the software will immediately review it. Getting it correctly will set the term as “Familiar”, and after multiple times it will be changed to “Mastered”. Furthermore, this spaced repetition app will give you constant feedback based on your answers, where you are in the learning process, and what you should focus on.</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.edapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EdApp</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/EdApp-logo.png" alt="EdApp logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS, Android, web</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Signing up for EdApp will give you a choice if you want to educate others or yourself. The registration is fast, and you can immediately create your topic or search in the content library based on your interest.</p>
<p>The contents will be summarized using texts, gifs, and short videos because visualization had a great positive effect on memorizing capabilities. The presentations also have interactive parts, triggering the mind with the element of surprise, stabilizing the learned information. While you are stepping further, EdApp will give you milestones to know where you are in the process.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> With its sophisticated approach and triggering effects, this spaced repetition software helps to improve memorizing information. On its finalizing page it summarizes the studied content, and based on your answers it gives feedback.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></h3>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.webp"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition/Anki-logo.png" alt="Anki logo"></picture> <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and any device with a web browser</p>
<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Anki is a simple, ad-free software that helps you to create flashcards. After downloading it to your computer or on your mobile phone, the first step is to generate decks, which will include flashcards. All cards have a front- and a backside that you can fill up with information. Also, you can insert pictures and other notes from your classes, so you can memorize those as well. You can also grade the difficulty of the lesson. Anki is mostly used by college students (especially in healthcare). It runs offline, and its ad-free, transparent user interface won’t cause any disturbance during studying.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Based on how difficult you have found the lecture, the program will offer you three choices to choose from: to see the lesson again in one minute or to repeat it in ten minutes or four days.</p>

<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Brainscape is a specialized spaced repetition system where the algorithm focuses on the areas which need improvements, based on your answers and learning patterns. This is a lively web surface because their team is openly active on other social media websites and showing their results and feedback from users and companies, furthermore, a blog, full of content, is available as well.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Brainscape will effectively monitor and check your answers and will support you - if you are honest how well you have known the flash cards’ answers, based on a scale from 1 to 5. It will also measure time during your study phases and help you to memorize information faster.</p>

<p><strong>The basic idea:</strong> Smartcards will support your studies with a learning curve, measure the optimal time, and suggest when to repeat your studies. This spaced repetition app is only available for iOS users.</p>
<p><strong>How it fits with SRLT:</strong> Its classical surface will help you not simply with drag and drop text flashcards, but you can also insert video and audio files to support the memorization process. Furthermore, typing an answer is also an option during the learning phase, and the program will color results to show if you were correct or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Learning accompanies us throughout our entire life, while as we age studying gets harder. Spaced repetition is a good-to-know tactic (or even life-hack) that you might have used before without consciously knowing it. Utilizing the method through one of the above spaced repetition software apps will help you to memorize learning materials more effectively and in less time. The method comes handy in all ages, regardless if you go to school, prepare for college exams, or do corporate training to develop your career.</p>

<![CDATA[SQLite as a Document Database]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>SQLite has had JSON support for a while.</p>

<p>However recently it added a killer feature: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html">generated
columns</a>. (This was added in 3.31.0,
released 2020-01-22.)</p>

<p>This makes it possible to insert JSON straight into SQLite and then have it
extract data and index them, i.e. you can treat SQLite as a document database.
This has been possible with PostgreSQL and obviously is what something like
Elastic provides but having it available in an embedded database is very nice
for lightweight stuff.</p>

<p>Let's get started:</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE t (
   body TEXT,
   d INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.d')) VIRTUAL);
sqlite&gt; insert into t values(json('{"d":"42"}'));
sqlite&gt; select * from t WHERE d = 42;
{"d":"42"}|42
</code></pre>

<p>It's that simple, the <code>d</code> column is extracted from the provided JSON.</p>

<p>(Aside: The hard bit may be getting a new enough SQLite, at the time of writing
Homebrew on macOS has it, else you likely need to use an unstable source like
nixpkgs-unstable.)</p>

<p>There's some nice properties of this. Normally it's encouraged to minifiy and
validate JSON when inserting (via the <code>json()</code> function) as because SQLite
doesn't have a JSON type it will allow anything. However nothing enforces that,
you could add a constraint but will probably forget... Having <code>GENERATED ALWAYS</code>
using <code>json_extract</code> means invalid JSON will get a <code>Error: malformed JSON</code> at
INSERT time.</p>

<p>This can be taken further:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE x (
  body TEXT,
  id TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.id')) VIRTUAL NOT NULL);
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('');
Error: malformed JSON
sqlite&gt; insert into x values('{}');
Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: x.id
</code></pre>

<p>We can enforce items are present in the inserted JSON, here by adding <code>NOT
NULL</code>, but we could also use constraints and other SQLite features!</p>

<p>You'll notice I've used <code>VIRTUAL</code> with the generated column in these examples.
There's also the option of using <code>STORED</code> to essentially cache the values,
although a downside is you can't add those columns via <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.</p>

<p>However you can always create an index on a column, even if it's defined a
virtual one:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX xid on x(id);</code></pre>

<p>Then check that's going to work as expected:
</p><pre><code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM x WHERE id='foo';
QUERY PLAN
`--SEARCH TABLE x USING INDEX xid (id=?)
</code></pre>

<p>Combined with ALTER TABLE we can add a new column and index it:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE x ADD COLUMN text TEXT
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS (json_extract(body, '$.text')) VIRTUAL;
INSERT INTO x VALUES(json('{"id":43, "text":"test"}'));
CREATE INDEX xtext ON x(text);
</code></pre>

<p>
The benefit here is you can start off with a table which could be as simple as
just a single JSON column, and add columns and indexes as you find useful data
in that JSON. For example this can work really well for webhooks, insert all the
data you are sent straight into a table, then pull out the useful stuff later.
Have fun.

It also can detect which user pin code was used to open the door (and when) — great peace of mind when giving cleaners a code to the house.</p><figure><picture><source srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" type="image/webp" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png.webp 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png.webp 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png.webp 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png.webp 768w"><img src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" alt="home assistant motioneye camera" width="947" height="717" title="Home Assistant " srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px" data-eio="l" data-src="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png" data-old-src="https://assets.technicallywizardry.com/wp-content/ewww/lazy/placeholder-947x717.png" data-srcset="https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM.png 1262w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-300x227.png 300w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-1024x776.png 1024w, https://content.technicallywizardry.com/2020/05/17160019/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-9.59.28-AM-768x582.png 768w"></picture><figcaption>Home Assistant connects to MotionEye to show the camera, motion alerts, and other detections.</figcaption></figure><p>But, most importantly, it can be locked/unlocked with a tap in Home Assistant.</p><h2><span id="Source_Code_Recap"></span>Source Code: Recap<span></span></h2><p>I wish I could give you copy-and-paste code for this project, but a lot of it will depend on your exact hardware, speakers, cameras, etc. Instead, I’ll recap each piece involved and link to the articles/code where I explain how to implement them:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/node-red-docker-kubernetes/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Node Red uses gpiod</a> to trigger a flow when GPIO #18 (the doorbell button) fires.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/loudspeaker-network-intercoms-alerts/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">loudspeaker alert flow plays a wav file</a>.</li><li>I have <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/speaker-multi-room-wireless-receiver/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">multiple DIY speakers</a> that play the alert around the house.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/diy-dashcam-raspberry-pi-zero-w-motion-eye/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">MotionEye drives the camera</a>, capturing stills and videos.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/iot/cctv-security-cameras/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">CCTV Security Cameras</a> handle person/object detection.</li><li><a href="https://www.technicallywizardry.com/tag/home-assistant/" data-wpel-link="internal" rel="internal follow noopener noreferrer">Home Assistant’s</a> Yale Lock integration allows us to lock/unlock.

<p>I am writing this post because Thunderbird 78.x has issues for advanced PGP users. But first, I’d like to say a few words to all the frustrated users: I hear you, I too am displeased with this update, but while it’s easy to complain and rant, we should look at the bright side and still be grateful that Mozilla thought of including PGP, as it makes it more accessible to users that are not as tech-savvy. It’s always good to push for privacy and having it built-in, and easy to use! But, there are issues with the new built-in PGP that we should talk about…</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>You know, as I stated in <a href="https://www.sindastra.de/p/1566/open-letter-why-it-security-is-obvious-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my open letter</a>: Security and privacy is important to me. Of course, this means I use PGP, or more specifically, GnuPG with smartcards.</p>
<p>I like FOSS, especially if it’s cross-platform as I use Linux, Mac and Windows (alphabetical order, no preference stated) and it’s great to be able to use your software on all your machines across all systems, and for free! The popular email client, Thunderbird is one such application that meets these criteria, and so is GnuPG (or GPG for short), a popular application that implements the OpenPGP specification.</p>
<p>GnuPG has a ton of features, among those features is the support of smartcards. Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the situation in Thunderbird before, and then since version 78.x and what we can do about it.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>before</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>Before Thunderbird 78.x (namely 68.x), if you had both Thunderbird and GnuPG installed, all you had to do was to install a Thunderbird addon known as Enigmail. This addon basically bridged the gap between Thunderbird and GnuPG, and essentially allowed you to experience full PGP within Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Of course this meant you had to install GnuPG on your system, then an addon, then generate and manage keys, and – although powerful – it was overall not as user-friendly as it could be.</p>
<p>So, even I as an advanced user, was excited that Thunderbird would come with PGP built-in in 78.x as I thought they might ship it with GnuPG, and something like Enigmail but built-in and maybe more user-friendly. At the very least having no third-party things to install sounds better. And convenience is nice, right? But I was wrong.</p>
<h2>The situation <em>since</em> version 78.x</h2>
<p>You see, Mozilla, the people behind Thunderbird did not ship it with GnuPG. Instead, they use a library called RNP. This library does not provide full-featured PGP.</p>
<p>RNP does for example, not support the use of smartcards. Which, basically means no PGP at all for me or any user with smartcards. Thunderbird does currently also not support using subkeys with detached primary key. Which means any advanced user that did a proper, more secure PGP setup, can also not use PGP with Thunderbird for the time being.</p>
<p>So, you might think to yourself: Just install Enigmail! Well, here’s the thing: Enigmail does not work with Thunderbird 78.x!</p>
<p>Thunderbird 78.x has hidden settings in the advanced configuration editor, that you can use to tell it to use external GnuPG, which is great! Except it doesn’t really work…</p>
<p>It did not work for me, and I tried many things, on different systems, followed different guides (including the official Mozilla Wiki), and heard the same from other users through the fediverse. For a friend of mine, setting up Thunderbird to use external GnuPG on Windows made it outright crash whenever trying to open a PGP encrypted email!</p>
<p>And this is basically the problem. On one hand, Mozilla was cool enough to include (some) PGP in Thunderbird which in theory makes it more accessible as you can generate and use keys with a few clicks, which is also good for us advanced users as we can then email privately with friends that would otherwise be unable to use PGP. But on the other hand the execution was bad in such a way that it stabs all the advanced users that were already using (advanced setups of) PGP.</p>
<h2>What to do about it (for now)</h2>
<p>Honestly, my advice to anyone that uses Thunderbird and depends on advanced PGP (smartcard etc.) for now: Just downgrade to Thunderbird 68.x and install Enigmail. It seems it will still receive updates for now and there’s no forced update to 78.x (yet). I just tried, and got an (undocumented) update for the 68.x version (namely 68.12.1).</p>
<p>Let’s hope they will keep providing security updates for 68.x until they have (hopefully) sorted out PGP in version 78.x so that we will eventually be able to upgrade, but without being pushed into a broken environment prematurely.</p>
<p>You can get the latest version of 68.x from here (official download link): <a href="https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/thunderbird/releases/68.12.1/</a></p>
<p>Please note that, Thunderbird will notice that the current configuration is from a newer version after downgrading, which you cannot use. This will result in a little window informing you about that on startup. Your only two options are to quit the application, or to create a new (configuration) profile. This means you will have to set up your accounts again but at least PGP will work again (with Enigmail and GnuPG)!</p>
<p>Thank you and goodnight! :D</p>
<h2>UPDATE 2020-NOV-29</h2>
<p>Hey everyone, this article drew many visitors after it was posted on HN (thanks, kind stranger!) and I did read through the comments (both here and some on HN)!</p>
<p>I’d like to address some things:</p>
<ol><li>I saw a tl;dr on HN which mentioned the downgrade recommendation, but without the details. As I understood it, it got criticized as you need to stay up to day for security reasons. And I agree with that. However, I’d like to make it clear that I only recommended a downgrade for now, as it seems the 68.x branch is still getting updates, as I experienced myself. As long as Thunderbird does not drop support for 68.x, and does not force an upgrade to 78.x, I think downgrading is fine. When Thunderbird finally drops support for 68.x, I would of course not recommend staying on outdated software.</li><li>When Thunderbird 68.x reaches EOL, and if 78.x hasn’t sorted out the issues with PGP by then, an alternative, if you’re on Windows and have MS Outlook, would be the free GpgOL extension for Outlook that comes bundled with Gpg4win. Please note that I don’t have experience with this myself, but I’d like to point it out anyway in case it’s useful. There’s also a (paid) Apple Mail extension that comes with gpgtools, however I do not recommend it unless you don’t mind paying for each new major version every year.</li><li>Thank you for informing me that Thunderbird is not part of Mozilla Corporation anymore, but as I understood it, still part of Mozilla Foundation. So, I guess in that case I’m addressing the Mozilla foundation. If this is still wrong, please let me know.</li></ol>
<p>PS I was exhausted and it was late at night when I originally wrote this article, and I wasn’t fully happy with it but people seemed to like it and had very constructive feedback which really helps. Thank you all for stopping by and reading it! &lt;3</p>

Meanwhile, <a href="http://r00t.cz/">r00t.cz</a> has been working in <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331097492482646016">decoding the frames</a>, which has led him to the amazing achievement of being able to <a href="http://www.r00t.cz/Sats/Change5">retrieve a short video</a> from the signal.</p>



<p>In this post I will look at some of the frames demodulated by USA Satcom and Paul during the first couple of days of the mission. The frame structure has many similarities with Tianwen-1, which I have described in several posts, such as <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-telemetry-framing-and-data/" data-type="post" data-id="8773">here</a> and <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/" data-type="post" data-id="8871">here</a>. However, there are some interesting differences.</p>



<h4>Low data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The low data rate telemetry signal is a PCM/PSK/PM signal with a subcarrier rate of 65536 Hz and a baudrate of 2048 baud. The coding is CCSDS concatenated frames with a Reed-Solomon codeword size of 252 bytes, so that a frame takes 2 seconds to transmit. The Reed-Solomon code uses the dual basis, as specified in the <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/131x0b3e1.pdf">TM Synchronization and Channel Coding</a> blue book. This is very similar to Tianwen-1’s low rate signal. The only differences are that Tianwen-1 uses a baudrate of 16384 baud (so frames take 0.25 seconds to transmit), and the conventional Reed-Solomon basis (which is not standard CCSDS).</p>



<p>Chang’e 5 has been seen to use <a href="https://twitter.com/coastal8049/status/1331782140900503556">a number of different frequencies</a> at X-band. Here I will be looking at some frames received by USA Satcom on 2020-11-24 between 4 and 6 UTC.</p>



<p>The frames are CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/732x0b3e1.pdf">AOS frames</a> coming from spacecraft ID 91. The spacecraft ID is quite relevant, because the spacecraft has different detachable modules: a service module, a return module, a lander, and an ascent module. Most likely each of these modules uses a different spacecraft ID, and we are in fact seeing data from different spacecraft IDs.</p>



<p>Two virtual channels are in use. Virtual channel 1 contains most of the data (a total of 5888 frames), while virtual channel 2 contains only 5 frames.</p>



<p>The AOS frames in both virtual channels have an insert zone that is 8 bytes long. The purpose of the first 4 bytes is unknown, while the last 4 bytes are a little-endian timestamp encoded as the number of seconds elapsed since 2012-08-01 00:00:00 UTC. It is interesting to compare this timestamp format with <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/07/more-about-the-tianwen-1-timestamps/" data-type="post" data-id="8734">that used in Tianwen-1</a>, which uses a 48 bit big-endian timestamp that encodes 100us units since 2016-01-01 00:00:00 Beijing time. The change from big-endian to little-endian is peculiar, since somehow the CCSDS protocols favour big-endian fields, and the change from a Beijing time epoch to a UTC epoch is also an interesting curiosity.</p>



<p>The M_PDU protocol is used to multiplex CCSDS <a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/133x0b2e1.pdf">Space Packets</a> in the AOS frames.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and virtual channel frame counter in the frames from virtual channel 1. The gaps correspond to time gaps between the different files provided by USA Satcom.</p>

<p>The Space Packets in virtual channel 1 use many different APIDs. I have been browsing through the plots of the data in each of the APIDs and they look reminiscent of Tianwen-1. There are many analogue telemetry channels, but I haven’t been able to spot any that has an obvious meaning, and there doesn’t seem to be any floating point data as in Tianwen-1. Here I show a few of the most interesting APIDs.</p>

<p>The five frames in virtual channel 2 were transmitted consecutively, perhaps in response to a telecommand. Each of them contains a single Space Packet from APID 897 that occupies all the frame.</p>



<p>The data from these Space Packets looks like some kind of file download or memory dump. The first 8 bytes contain three fixed bytes that maybe identify the file or the region of memory followed by a 5 byte little-endian chunk counter. The transfer here uses only 5 chunks, and most of the data in the last chunk is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding bytes. The figure below shows the data in this transfer, with one chunk per row. The data clearly shows patterns, but I have no idea what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="187" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-644x187.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-300x87.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2-768x223.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_vc2.png 864w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a><figcaption>Chang’e transfer in APID 897</figcaption></figure>



<p>The code and data used in this part of the post, including the full plots of all the APIDs, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/daniestevez/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/CE5/CE-5%20frame%20analysis.ipynb">this Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>



<h4>High data rate telemetry</h4>



<p>The high data rate telemetry uses 2.5Mbaud BPSK <a href="https://twitter.com/r2x0t/status/1331351055972642818">according to r00t</a>. Coding is, as in the case of <a href="https://destevez.net/2020/08/tianwen-1-high-speed-data-signal/">Tianwen-1 high data rate long frames</a>, concatenated CCSDS frames using four interleaved Reed-Solomon codewords (with 255 bytes each).</p>



<p>The data used here is a short segment received by Paul on 2020-11-24 between 20:52 and 20:58 UTC at 8455 MHz. It is quite interesting to see the errors corrected by the Reed-Solomon decoder, which show large variability but indicate that Paul has more than enough SNR margin to decode the signal.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png"><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs.png 612w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_rs-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></a></figure>



<p>The data consists of AOS frames from spacecraft ID 26 (note this is a different spacecraft ID to the one in the low rate data used in the previous part). Virtual channels 38 and 63 are in use, with 18396 and 51850 frames respectively.</p>



<p>In contrast to the AOS frames used for the low data rate telemetry, here the AOS insert zone is only 6 bytes long, with 2 unknown bytes that always contain the value <code>0xf0f0</code> followed by a 4 byte timestamp using the same format as in the low data rate frames. There is no M_PDU. The data follows directly after the insert zone.</p>



<p>Virtual channel 63 consists solely of idle data. This is a standard feature of the AOS Space Data Link protocol called OID channel (only idle data), which is always virtual channel 63. The data in the frames of this virtual channel is filled with <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<p>The figure below shows the timestamps and frame counter in the OID channel.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The frame loss computed from the jumps in the virtual channel frame counter shows that very few frames were lost. The large jumps near the end correspond to a gap in Paul’s data, which is divided into two files.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png"><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss.png 625w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_oid_loss-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></figure>



<p>Virtual channel 38 is quite interesting. I <a href="https://twitter.com/ea4gpz/status/1331711668045434886">joked on Twitter</a> that it resembles the Inception film, because it has several layers of CCSDS protocols. The timestamps in this virtual channel are quite weird, since comparing with the timestamps from the OID channel they seem to run too fast and extend into the future. There is no way that the 18396 frames in this virtual channel are able to span one hour and 30 minutes as shown here. I’m not sure what’s happening with this.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="385" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-644x385.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc-300x179.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc.png 647w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>This shows the first frames in virtual channel 38. We can discern the AOS headers, then two parts that seem quite similar, and then a large section of <code>0xaa</code> padding.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png"><img loading="lazy" width="644" height="173" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-644x173.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-300x80.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data-768x206.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_sc26_vc38_fc_data.png 877w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>



<p>The data field of each of these AOS frames contains a single Space Packet, which is embedded directly without using M_PDU. The length of the Space Packet is 510 bytes including its header, which explains why the end of the AOS frame is filled with padding. These Space Packets belong to APID 92.</p>



<p>The contents of each of these Space Packets are two back to back AOS frames, which explains the repetition in the figure below. The AOS frames belong to spacecraft ID 197 (yet a new spacecraft!), virtual channel ID 52, and have the replay flag set.</p>



<p>The insert zone of these replayed AOS frames contains three unknown bytes followed by a 32 bit timestamp in the usual format. The timestamps and frame counts are shown below. The replay data is actually from the previous day, starting just 30 minutes after launch.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="631" height="387" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png" alt="" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc.png 631w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_replay_fc-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px"></figure>



<p>These AOS frames have a CRC-16, in contrast with the usual AOS frames, which rely on the Reed-Solomon parity check bytes for error detection. The CRC of all the replay frames I’ve decoded is correct.</p>



<p>These replay AOS frames use M_PDU, and contain Space Packets from APIDs 301 and 2047 (the idle APID). As expected, the idle APID packets contain only zeros. The data in APID 301 is shown in the figure below. I am not sure how to interpret it, but some of the structure is evident.</p>



<figure><a href="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png" alt="" width="644" height="640" srcset="https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-644x640.png 644w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-300x298.png 300w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-150x150.png 150w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-768x763.png 768w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301-100x100.png 100w, https://destevez.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ce5_apid301.png 923w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></figure>
