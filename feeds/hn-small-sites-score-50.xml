<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After our team successfully <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/T8012#Bootrom_Exploits">ported</a> the <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit">checkm8</a> exploit to the AppleSilicon T2 chip, we began exploring methods for closed-case hardware debugging, or CCD, as found on other iDevices. On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

<center>Segger J-Link Probe output when attached to ACE2 (CD3217).</center><h2 id="ace-overview">ACE Overview</h2><p>To better understand the inner-workings of ACE, we began looking for identifying information within the dumped firmware. We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

        <p>
          Did you ever wonder how 3D engines render objects on the screen? Or how graphics APIs such as OpenGL or DirectX are written? This course is a complete immersion on how CPU-based 3D engines work. We will use C to develop a complete 3D engine from scratch, pixel by pixel, triangle per triangle. This is a basic course that requires no prior knowledge, but you will probably make the most of it if you know already the basics of programming.

                  <p>Been waiting for a course like this for years.  A lot of the theory of 3d graphics is availablein books and online , but none that put it into practice in such a clear way (if at all) . Also using C which I am more comfortable using than OOP (i'm a bit old school) .  It is a great refresher on C too, its a big project so far (only a bout 1/3 of the way through), but loving it so far.  </p>

                  <p>This course going into details which are usually if not always omitted by other courses in this category. I liked that the math and actual algorithms were discussed before implementing them and student own problem solving opportunity was encouraged throughout. This course has enabled me to fill in the critical gaps in some of the most important fundamental concepts in 3d graphics programming. Hope to see more!! Thank you.</p>

I bought it because I want to support those kind of materials! I basically learned all this stuff by myself through books and articles, but this course is a all in one place to learn them all at once, in a fun/approachable and motivating way that will make you save some precious time. Even if this is a good refresher for me and I already had the "clicks" before, I'll recommend it for anyone wanting to become a graphics/game/programmer !</p>

	<div>
		<p>Let’s come back, more directly, to a theme in my writing — what happens when something small becomes a tipping point for change. <strong>When the seemingly innocuous becomes unpredictable.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve only casually followed the <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/why-are-there-so-many-protests-in-hong-kong/">Hong Kong protests</a> and reaction from the Chinese mainland and overseas Chinese communities, you might wonder about the importance and meaning of the covered eye. Specifically, the right eye.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters found one of their many symbols (and there are many) when police shot and injured the right eye of a protesting woman in August. The injured eye is a more powerful symbol than even that of the man police shot on October 1 (Chinese National Day) in the chest (that is, <em>the heart</em>).</p>
<p>But since the now famous protester’s eye injury we’ve seen company ad campaign apologies and even an individual arrest all because of missing eyes.</p>
<p>But the eye I was reminded of was none of these. It was a different eye — also a right eye and in China — that over 40 years ago had results reminiscent to those eyes of today.</p>

<p>If you are a student of Chinese Cultural Revolution artwork, you might recognize this painting of an owl by Huang Yongyu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg" alt="Huang Yongyu's owl with one closed eye" width="400" height="607" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Huang-Yongyu-Owl-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Huang served three and a half years in a labor camp for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/huang-yongyu/owl-1973">painting was interpreted</a> as a “portrayal of public officials turning a blind eye to wrong doings.” It’s not clear if he meant it as such.</p>
<p>Huang’s owl was one of many works of art gathered for a “black painting” (meaning counter-revolutionary) <a href="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6w1007nt&amp;chunk.id=d0e11683&amp;toc.id=d0e10324&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;anchor.id=bkd0e11803#X">exhibition and criticism</a> meeting in the 1970s. In some cases, officials had to scrounge around to find more “black painters” to have enough art to criticize. If you read some of the art descriptions, it seems like at least some of the artists were just unlucky rather than counter-revolutionary.</p>
<p>And while I haven’t seen anyone publicly connect Huang’s winking owl with the protests of today, I imagine people with longer memories think about it.</p>
<p>Next in chronology we have of course the event from this summer in Hong Kong. A woman attending a protest was shot in her right eye. Covering one’s <a href="https://www.thelily.com/an-eye-for-an-eye-how-one-womans-eye-patch-became-the-symbol-of-the-hong-kong-protests/">right eye</a> soon became a symbol.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1496"><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Hong-Kong-eye-e1572126020800.png" alt="Covering the right eye" width="600" height="309"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1496">from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/08/13/how-bloody-eye-patches-became-latest-symbol-escalating-hong-kong-protests/">Washington Post</a> article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And as a good symbol, it is impossible to ignore (you can’t look away from someone’s eyes and still talk). As a good symbol it also brings the eye-patch wearers themselves into some discomfort.</p>
<p>The eye symbol became even better known when a foreign company felt pressure to remove and apologize for an old ad that predated the Hong Kong protests, but which happened to include a covered right eye.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/742601426037240952/">Tiffany ad</a> (since removed) that pre-dates the protests.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - one covered eye" width="474" height="554" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1.jpg 474w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-1-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"></p>
<p>And here’s <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/08/tiffany-removes-advert-hong-kong-controversy/">another Tiffany ad</a>, also removed following complaints to the company for stirring up social disorder.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg" alt="Tiffany ad - covered right eye" width="525" height="273" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-300x156.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2-768x399.jpg 768w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tiffany-eye-2.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>And to compare, here’s another picture of Sun Feifei (the same model in the second Tiffany ad) covering her right eye in another photo shoot, also months before the protests in Hong Kong. And actually shown on a <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/photos/2010-04/20/content_19863707.htm">government-run website, even today</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg" alt="Tiffany model covering her right eye" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye.jpg 400w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sun-Feifei-eye-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>So eye covering can look like a matter of intent. The china.org.cn right eye picture can obviously have no connection to the Hong Kong protests. But a foreign company is different, even with ads shot months before the covered eye became a protest symbol.</p>
<p>Of course, the covered eye — again, the right eye — has been used famously before in an ad campaign: “The Man in the Hathaway Shirt.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg" alt="Man in the Hathaway shirt" width="525" height="706" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-595x800.jpg 595w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt-223x300.jpg 223w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hathaway-shirt.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>No political meaning. Just an Ogilvy ad with the eyepatch used as a gimmick.</p>
<p>But there’s more again.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://shanghaiist.com/2019/10/08/houston-rockets-fan-detained-for-posting-photo-of-himself-about-to-burn-chinese-flag/">Houston Rockets fan in China</a> (the same team whose manager posted a “Stand with Hong Kong” tweet) was much too cynical on the ability of his government to track him down.</p>
<p>The first line (after the hashtag) says: “I live and die with my team.” The second line: “Come and catch me.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-1024x546.jpg" alt="Covered right eye, now in jail" width="525" height="280" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest.jpg 1024w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-300x160.jpg 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rockets-fan-arrest-768x410.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"></p>
<p>They caught him, just a few hours later. And it appears he covered an eye to make facial identification more difficult. But again, what if he hadn’t covered his eye?</p>
<p>The apology from Tiffany strikes an international audience as the exportation of anti-protester values. The above picture of the NBA fan chained in a “tiger chair” strikes an international audience as not the future they want for themselves. <strong>Has the visual symbol of the eye — uncontrollable once the injury and advertisements happened — helped spread this message further?</strong></p>
<h2>Wearing of Masks</h2>
<p>Should protesters anywhere be allowed to wear masks? While a number of US states already had <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/10/22/boston-and-hong-kong-debate-over-masks/JYajFCkul7UMw7PaXyZ5vL/story.html">mask bans in public spaces</a>, general public opinion seemed even more in support of the bans after a number of mask wearing Antifa members beat up a reporter in Portland earlier this year. The argument against masks was that covering one’s face minimize the feeling of social disapproval and led to worse behavior.</p>
<p>The US has at times overturned mask bans, famously after the Iranian Revolution as a way to protect Iranian protesters in California. But those masked were protesting a government from which they had fled to the US. It’s a different story when the protesters are domestic.</p>
<p>But a different explanation emerged in the Hong Kong protests now that we have <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/emergence-of-omniscience-part-1-images/">identity at scale</a>. Protesters had already taken cautions to avoid identification by using single-use MTR (metro) transit cards and paying in cash. But faces could be identified at scale either live or in the near future by capturing records of protest attendance, assessing behavior, and following up with repercussions.</p>
<p>Hong Kong protesters also try to take down eyes on the crowd in the form of smart lampposts. There are a number of videos of them <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/24/tear-gas-kwun-tong-hong-kong-protesters-surround-police-station-dismantle-surveillance-lampposts/">dismantling these lampposts</a> out of fear of surveillance.</p>
<p>For me it’s interesting to reflect on the news from Hong Kong because Hong Kong is a place I have visited over almost 30 years. During that time, I also lived there for around six years. Five of the visits and about one year of the living there was pre-Handover. In the time leading up to 1997, I observed (can’t really say I demonstrated) in a few events. These fell into a few types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marches, often along Queen’s Road, in crowds in the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.</li>
<li>Sit-down demonstrations outside of the New China News Agency (the NCNA was the de facto Chinese embassy pre-Handover).</li>
<li>June 4th remembrances in Victoria Park (including the last pre-Handover one), often culminating in the crowd holding lit candles. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYwsPt854Xo">Cui Jian’s <em>Nothing To My Name</em></a> would always be played (a song popular at 1989 Tiananmen).</li>
</ul>
<p>No one wore a mask, because there wasn’t any need to do so. The protest leaders were already known. The crowd was safe in numbers. I never heard anyone fear identification, even post-Handover.</p>
<p>If you contrast the protesters of back then with those of the last six months, they are unrecognizable.</p>
<p>That protesters hide their faces and cut down smart lampposts makes sense. Like the eyes in the advertisements above, the lampposts may not have any intent to use facial recognition to identify protesters, but there is no trust. Anything can look suspicious. If the capability is there to help your adversary, then you assume they use it. Especially if there are examples of mass surveillance already in place, for example in the Chinese province of <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/uyghurs-xinjiang-onward-to-the-inevitable/">Xinjiang</a>.</p>
<h2>Consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identity at scale can weaken trust.</li>
<li>Visual symbols can spread a message.</li>
<li>Huang Yongyu’s owl paintings now sell at auction.</li>
</ul>

    <p>An agora, in its broadest sense, is a conceptual space where people attempt to bring an increased level of intentionality, explicitness, and mutual agreement to the principles and protocols for interacting in that space. A further aspect of the idea of an Agora is that it is a space which enables collaboration. In particular, it is a space that allows for collaboration guided by specific shared interests, without requiring the co-consitutients of the agora to be aligned more fully or generally in terms of their intentions, values, etc. </p>
<p>Some topics that the idea of an Agora is related to: <a href="http://anagora.org/node/transparency" rel="nofollow">transparency</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/decentralized-structures" rel="nofollow">decentralized structures</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/egalitarian-principles" rel="nofollow">egalitarian principles</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/judgement" rel="nofollow">judgement</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/algorithms-of-interaction" rel="nofollow">algorithms of interaction</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/communication" rel="nofollow">communication</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/collaboration" rel="nofollow">collaboration</a> <a href="http://anagora.org/node/knowledge-sharing" rel="nofollow">knowledge sharing</a></p>
<p>There are (infinitely) many possible variants of how this idea might be implemented in concrete, real-world situations. For example, an agora could be a space that is opened up inside a conversation between two people. Or it could be a collaborative project that is accompanied by specified rules. Or it could be a collective agreement about how to handle certain types of situations. </p>
<p>One variant of the idea of an Agora is a place where personal notes are shared, with the common goal of pooling information and sharing knowledge. One implementation of this idea is <a href="https://anagora.org/" rel="nofollow">https://anagora.org</a>. See also <a href="https://flancia.org/go/agora" rel="nofollow">https://flancia.org/go/agora</a>.</p>
<p>The term "Agora" and the basic idea come from <a href="http://anagora.org/node/flancia" rel="nofollow">Flancia</a>. </p>

<p>Below is a loosely-categorized collection of links to CS textbooks in a variety of areas that are
freely available online, usually because they are one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An open textbook (such as PLAI, SF, or the HoTT book)</li>

<p>Most of these I’ve only used for brief personal reference, and have not read in depth.  The exceptions, those books I’ve spent considerable time with and highly recommend, are marked with asterisks.</p>

<p>I also include below a list of papers I consider good stand-alone introductions to certain topics, and a list of links to thorough special topics courses.</p>

<p>If you find one of the links below is broken or has moved, feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>Those with time to spare and looking to have less of it may enjoy browsing the QA call numbers in <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">UPenn’s extensive listing of online books</a>.  Most of those listed here were found independently over the years, but I’ve just now (June 2020) learned of this excellent repository of links.  I’ll add to the links below as I find promising books.</p>

  <section>
    <p>One of the biggest disadvantages of static site generators is that
they are static and can’t include comments.</p>
<p>There are multiples solutions to solve this problem. You could add
a third party blog engine like Disqus, but this has the drawback
of including a third-party tool with a bad privacy record in your
website. Another solution would be to host an open-source alternative
but this comes at the cost of a higher maintenance burden. Having
to host a database was something we wanted to avoid with a
static site generator.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a better solution is to leverage the Mastodon and
Fediverse platform. Mastodon is a decentralized social network
and it allows people to communicate with each other without
being on the same server. It is inspired by Twitter, but instead
of tweeting, you write toot.</p>
<p>When publishing an article, you now only need to also write a
simple toot linking to your article. Then Mastodon has a simple
API to fetch the answer to your toot. This is the code I made for
my Hugo powered blog, but it is easily adaptable for other static
site generators. It will create a button to load comments instead
of loading them for every visitor so that it decreases the load on your
mastodon server.</p>

        <div><p>A <span><a title="Longitudinal Study into Violent Video Games" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2020.0049">ten-year longitudinal study</a></span>&nbsp;published in the Journal of <em>Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking</em> on a group in early adolescence from as young as ten years old, investigated how playing violent video games at an early age would translate into adulthood behavior (23 years of age). Titled "Growing Up with Grand Theft Auto: A 10-Year Study of Longitudinal Growth of Violent Video Game Play in Adolescents" the study found no correlation between growing up playing video games and increased levels of aggression ten years later.</p><p>This particular study utilized a more contemporary approach for analyzing its data, known as the person-centered approach. Traditional studies use a variable-centered approach whereby researchers treat each variable, or characteristic, as related to another variable. An example would be that exercising is related to a reduced incidence of heart disease. This has been particularly valuable when comparing groups. In a person-centered approach researchers combine various algorithms across variables to determine how these variables compare among individuals. This approach provides a more accurate depiction of how variables relate to the individual.</p><p>As such, this study “accounts for heterogeneity, grouping individuals who are similar and who share a set of characteristics that vary similarly over time.” Participant families were recruited through “a large north-western city” beginning in 2007 (Wave 1) via telephone directories and required to complete questionnaires. 65% were Caucasian, 12% black and 19% multi-ethnic, 4% other. Families of lower socioeconomic status were underrepresented as part of the initial sample group and therefore needed recruitment via referrals and fliers to add to and diversify the sample group.</p><p>Video game violence ratings were assessed through the Common Sense Media, known to be a viable rating body for media. Participants were assessed through various behavioral characteristics such as aggression, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and prosocial behavior.</p><p>Results showed that boys played more violent video games than girls. Groups displayed three forms of video game play, according to the study: high-initial violence (4%) which indicated individuals played a high-level of violent video games at an early age, moderate initial violence (23%) whereby violent video game play was moderate at an early age, and low initial violence (73%).</p><p>The study concluded that group with low initial violence “was no higher in aggressive behavior than the high initial violence group at the final time point.” Therefore, it is determined that adolescents who played a high-level of violent video games at an early age did not show more aggressive behavior later in life than those who played fewer to no hours of violent video games at an early age.</p></div>

				<p>We’re very excited to be making a <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">Flow preview</a> available for public download for the first time. Flow has a fast, modern, architecture that doesn’t share its layout engine with any other browser. While able to render most websites well, many perfectly, Flow still has some way to go. Each month more pages work, as more JavaScript APIs are added or additional CSS functionality created.</p>

<p><span id="more-4917"></span>We have chosen to release on just one platform initially, and there are a couple of reasons why. The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 400 has very similar performance to many set-top box chips, so a release that demonstrates Flow’s animation performance on embedded hardware is more useful than on a PC where all browsers can easily get 60fps.</p>
<p>It’s been a year since our <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/">Google Mail</a> blog post was picked up on <a href="https://twitter.com/FlowBrowser/status/1200070712121348096" data-wplink-edit="true">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Our unexpected sudden fame meant we weren’t prepared for a public browser release, and expectations were (and probably still are) unrealistically high. Most of the HTML user interfaces that we had tried rendered well, and Flow regularly outperformed other browsers on set-top boxes. But, websites never looked quite right.</p>
<p>Last September, we detailed <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/can-we-fix-it/">our work</a> on tracking down and fixing the rendering of various major websites. No one bug was particularly tricky to fix once we had narrowed it down, but the end result made the browser engine feel much more like an actual browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some previously working sites have stopped working due to improvements in their content, for instance, Amazon now requires Web Cryptography to log in. This is a feature currently in progress.</p>
<p>This preview has many features missing that you would reasonably expect from a browser. Media source extensions, cryptography, and CSS Grid are being actively worked on. We have plenty more to get on with, including a UI, accessibility, and better text editing functionality.</p>
<p>We generally know which sites work and which don’t, but prioritise our commercial customers. Bug fixes that impact them usually fix websites, just not necessarily your favourite website. If you are able to help us track down why a particular website (or library) fails to work, we would be very appreciative of a small test case demonstrating the bug. The more simple the test case is, the more likely we are to fix the bug. We will read all emails but, sadly, may not be able to reply.</p>
<p>And finally, while the preview is for the Raspberry Pi 400, it also works on the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous models use a different GPU with different GPU drivers, so we are holding off releasing for those until we have optimised the graphics support.</p>
<p>We hope this preview demonstrates where we are with a brand new browser engine. The feedback we get for this public preview will directly affect the prospects for desktop platforms. Enjoy it, be critical, but please don’t expect Flow to be usable on your favourite websites right now.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!
Cheers!</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.</p>

<p>While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it "initimidation surveillance" as it lacks the aspect of "covert" type of actions.</p>

<p>On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.</p>
