<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content">
<p>Recently I have become curious about <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">the Gemini
Project</a> and the content that people have
made available to be retrieved over the gemini:// protocol.  I’m not convinced
by the arguments for not just using http, and mostly it’s just that I
typically find more things that I am interested in casually reading through on
people’s gemlogs than I would on, say, reddit, and similar aggregators.  But
presumably advocates of gemini:// and the text/gemini format would argue that
it’s various respects in which it differs from the web that makes geminispace
conducive to the production of the sort of content you find there.  So I’m
remaining open minded about the possibility that having a completely separate
protocol is important, and not just an annoyance because rss2email doesn’t
work and I had to spend time writing
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/gmi2email">gmi2email</a>.</p>

<p>I now have a games console at home for the first time in some years, which I
bought in response to the ongoing pandemic, and one thing that I have noticed
is that using it feels like being offline in a way that playing games on a
regular computer never would.  It has a WiFi connection but it doesn’t have a
web browser, and I am glad that using it provides an opportunity to be
disconnected from the usual streams of information.  And perhaps something
similar ought to be said in favour of how the Gemini project does not just use
http.  There is, perhaps, a positive psychological effect induced by making
the boundary between text/gemini and the web as hard as it is made by using
gemini:// rather than http.</p>

<p>Something about which I find myself much more sceptical is how the
specification for gemini:// and text/gemini is not extensible.  Advocates of
Gemini have this idea that they can’t include, say, a version number in the
protocol, because the extensibility of the web is what has led to the problems
they think it has, so they want to make it impossible.  Now on the one hand
perhaps the people behind Gemini are in the best position that anyone is in to
come up with a spec which they will finalise and render effectively
unchangeable, because a lot of them have been using Gopher for decades, and so
they have enough experience to be able to say exactly what Gopher is missing,
and be confident that they’ve not missed anything.  But on the other hand,
Gemini is one technological piece in attempts to make a version of the
Internet which is healthier for humans – the so-called “small Internet”
movement – and maybe there will be new ideas about how the small Internet
should be which would benefit from a new version of the Gemini specification.
So it seems risky to lock-in to one version.</p>

<center><b>Counterfeiting Stock 2.0</b></center>

<p>
Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.
</p>
<p>
<span>Why is This Important?</span> This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock — it touches the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to “market forces” when they are often market manipulations.
</p>
<p>
The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start–up capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers. 
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed—the company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off–shore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span>A Glossary of Illogical Terms</span> — The securities industry has its own jargon, laws and practices that may require explaining. Most of these concepts are the creation of the industry, and, while they are promoted as practices that ensure an orderly market, they are also exploited as manipulative tools. This glossary is limited to naked short abuse, or counterfeiting stock as it is more correctly referred to. 
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Broker Dealer or Prime Broker</b> — The big stockbrokers who clear their own transactions, which is to say they move transacted shares between their customers directly, or with the DTC. Small brokers will clear through a clearing house — also known as a broker's broker.
</li>
<li><b>Hedge Funds</b> — Hedge funds are really unregulated investment pools for rich investors. They have grown exponentially in the past decade and now number over 10,000 and manage over one trillion dollars. They don't register with the SEC, are virtually unregulated and frequently foreign domiciled, yet they are allowed to be market makers with access to all of the naked shorting loopholes. Frequently they operate secretively and collusively. The prime brokers cater to the hedge funds and allegedly receive eight to ten billion dollars annually in fees and charges relating to stock lend to the short hedge funds.
</li>
<li><b>Market Maker</b> — A broker, broker dealer or hedge fund who makes a market in a stock. In order to be a market maker, they must always have shares available to buy and sell. Market makers get certain sweeping exemptions from SEC rules involving naked shorting.
</li>
<li><b>Short Seller</b> — An individual, hedge fund, broker or institution who sells stock short. The group of short sellers is referred to as “the shorts.”
</li>
<li><b>The Securities and Exchange Commission</b> — The SEC is the federal enforcement agency that oversees the securities markets. The top–level management is a five–person Board of Governors who are Presidential appointees. Three of the governors are usually from the securities industry, including the chairman. The SEC adopted Regulation SHO in January 2005 in an attempt to curb naked short abuse.
</li>
<li><b>Depository Trust Clearing Corp</b> — Usually known as the DTCC, this privately held company is owned by the prime brokers and it clears, transacts and holds most stock in this country. It has four subsidiaries, which include the DTC and the NCSS. The operation of this company is described in detail later.
</li>
<li><b>Short Sale</b> — Selling a stock short is a way to make a profit while the stock price declines. For example: If investor S wishes to sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes some of the money from his account and buys a share, called “covering”, which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and investor L has his share back.
<p>This relatively simple process is perfectly legal—so far. The investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level. If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.
</p></li>
<li><b>Disclosed Short</b> — When the share has been borrowed or a suitable share has been located that can be borrowed, it is a disclosed short. Shorts are either naked or disclosed, but, in reality, some disclosed shorts are really naked shorts as a result of fraudulent stock borrowing. 
</li>
<li><b>Naked Short</b> — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. 
<p>
Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.
</p></li>
<li><b>Fails–to–Deliver</b> — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
<p>
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).
</p></li>
<li><b>Options</b> — The stock market also has separate, but related markets that sell options to purchase shares (a “call”) and options to sell shares (a “put”). Options are an integral part of short manipulations, the result of SEC promulgated loopholes in Reg SHO. A call works as follows: Assume investor L has a share in his account that is worth $25. He may sell an option to purchase that share to a third party. That option will be at a specific price, say $30, and expires at a specific future date. Investor L will get some cash from selling this option. If at the expiration date, the market value of the stock is below $30 (the “strike price”), the option expires as worthless and investor L keeps the option payment. This is called “out of the money.” If the market value of the stock is above the strike price, then the buyer of the option “calls” the stock. Assume the stock has risen to $40. The option buyer tenders $30 to investor L and demands delivery of the share, which he may keep or immediately sell for a $10 profit.
</li>
<li><b>Naked call</b> — The same as above except that investor L, who sells the call, has no shares in his account. In other words, he is selling an option on something he does not own. The SEC allows this. SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.
</li>
</ol>

<p>In a previous <a href="https://onurgumus.github.io/2020/12/26/Functional-Programming.html">post</a> I have explained my motivations for functional programming.
It’s no secret I love F# because F# makes me sleep better. In this post, I would like to discuss some different aspects of F#.</p>

<h2 id="f-is-gaining-independence-from-net">F# is gaining independence from .NET</h2>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/platform.png" alt="F# platforms"></p>

<!--more-->

<p>F# is mostly known to the developer community as the small ignored brother of C# running on the .NET platform. However, what is less known about F# is that it
has come to a level to be .NET independent. Thanks to <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>, today F# can be considered as a complete replacement of TypeScript. Yes,
people do write full-blown SPA, React, Svelte applications by using F# instead of TypeScript. If you think Fable is just a transpiler, think again:  https://github.com/kunjee17/awesome-fable . I would say Fable is on the way being an ecosystem by itself.</p>

<p>There is also a new prototype target for Fable that allows F# code to transpile to Python developed by Dag Brattli.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/python2.gif" alt="Python"></p>

<p>F# also works as on WebAssembly with <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a> which is still based on .NET. And not to forget another F# web platform called <a href="https://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a> from the same people who developed Bolero.</p>

<p>Just like JavaScript people were using NodeJs to bring the front-end devs to the backend zone, F# also can be used to bring the backend-devs to the front-end realm. I am a living example myself. By using F# in the font-end you can practically share the code between your .NET/Node backend and the browser, giving you an isomorphic development experience.</p>

<p>This somewhat puts F# in an interesting position as historically most dotnet has been languages are managed by Microsoft. But Fable simply liberates
F# from Microsoft and .NET.</p>

<h2 id="the-f-fanboys">The F# fanboys</h2>

<p>You might have heard “one of those guys” like me who is talking about how great functional programming and/or F# is. And from that point, it looks like below</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/music.png" alt="music"></p>

<p>I know it’s annoying, however, let’s look at it from the side and this is how an F# developer feels when he or she is suggesting you using F#:
<img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/wheel.png" alt="wheels"></p>

<h2 id="microsofts-and-communitys-stance">Microsoft’s and community’s stance</h2>

<p>From Microsoft’s point of view, F# is actively supported and maintained. There are Microsoft developers actively fixing things and adding new features however as a general Microsoft’s point of view .NET == C# and that is that. From .NET developer community’s
point of view, things are even worse. Since all Microsoft docs and tools geared towards C#, adding up unfamiliarity with the functional paradigm, most people follow C# way and completely ignore its little brother F#. I still think this is a missed 
opportunity for the .NET community. For example, let’s look at the excellent server side F# web framework <a href="https://giraffe.wiki/">Giraffe</a>. 
While C# and asp.net developers are busy memorizing the Microsoft way of handling requests, learning what attributes to decorate their
classes and members, the F# developers who use giraffe, simply rely on functional composition:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>route</span> <span>"/"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setHttpHeader</span> <span>"X-Foo"</span> <span>"Bar"</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setStatusCode</span> <span>200</span>
    <span>&gt;=&gt;</span> <span>setBodyFromString</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As HTTP processing is usually treated as a pipeline by itself on the server-side, it’s an excellent target for functional programming. Just like lego, plug-in your pipes, and you are good to go.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most developers worry about if they could find an F# job whereas companies who consider making the switch worry if they could find an F# developer.
As of today on linked in there are approximately 700 F# jobs and even most of these are not F# specific rather than they are like “C# or F# developers wanted”.</p>

<p>And most non-.NET people are not willing to touch anything related to Microsoft even with a 10 foot pole. (Of course, the major exceptions to this are TypeScript and Visual Studio Code which both are widely popular). The  Functional programmers’ camp also dismisses F# at sight blaming it’s not like Haskell as in for example F# does not support type classes.</p>

<h2 id="couple-of-unique-features-of-f">Couple of unique features of F#</h2>

<p>I am not going to talk about the features of F# but just wanted to highlight a couple of them.</p>

<p>The first one is the file order. Please look at the below photo:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/files.png" alt="file-order"></p>

<p>In F# the order of the files matter. It is somewhat a disliked feature by the newcomers, but it makes the dependencies immediately visible.
So the code in the top file has no dependency on any others below and the 2nd file from the top only depends on the first. When you open a project which you are not 
familiar, file ordering helps to find your way.</p>

<p>The second one is Type Providers:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/sqlprovider.gif" alt="type-providers"></p>

<p>Type providers are somewhat code generators but they do that non-intrusively. Very roughly similar to LISP style macros they expand at compile time. Type providers make it very easy to discover HTML or JSON documents read database rows, file system, and discover DDL and rows within the coding screen without leaving your editor. And everything becomes so type-safe.</p>

<h2 id="develop-fantastic-ui-apps-with-f-and-elmish">Develop fantastic UI apps with F# and Elmish</h2>

<p>Well they say seeing is believing, so let’s see how well F# handles UI development. While React devs on Facebook trying to solve the state problem over and over again by using hooks and perhaps new experimental
recoil and contexts IMHO, all are horrible options as they encourage rendering code inter-mix with business code reminding me asp.net web forms times where you could write your SQL statements right into the page itself.</p>

<p>F# developers have ported elm architecture to something called elmish and it flourished well among F# community.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of things you can do with Elmish as you can write your business code once and port it to any UI platform below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>React: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/react">Elmish React</a></li>
  <li>Windows Desktop: <a href="https://github.com/elmish/Elmish.WPF">Elmish WPF</a></li>
  <li>Gaming: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Xelmish">Xelmish</a></li>
  <li>Cross platform UI: <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Avalonia.FuncUI">Avalonia.FuncUI</a></li>
  <li>Mobile development: <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/Fabulous">Fabulous</a></li>
  <li>Terminal: <a href="https://github.com/DieselMeister/Terminal.Gui.Elmish">Terminal.Gui.Elmish</a></li>
  <li>Web Assembly: <a href="https://fsbolero.io/">Bolero</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They all share the same single architecture: Elmish. So you can write your code for one and port it to another.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-some-resources">Getting started and some resources</h2>

<p>If you want to get started to F#, the first place you should check out is <a href="https://fsharp.org/">F# Software Foundation</a></p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-31-What-the-F/fsf2.png" alt="fsharp-foundation"></p>

<p>As you can see FSharp Software Foundation offers mentorship programs periodically, which means you can have a free weekly 1 on 1 session with an experienced F# developer! As of today the program is open for people who want to have an F# mentor or want to be
an F# mentor. You can apply from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKgZaAcjf7ZxVqBZzyZcBi609BOc0etBnV5XhR6BMihdyYRw/viewform">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are sold with F# there is one important point to highlight. Do not treat F#, just another language with different syntax especially if you are familiar
with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, etc. You have to embrace functional programming as a paradigm. F# is a functional-first programming language. In other words,
although F# has OOP syntax as well, it mostly makes sense to use F# when you want to get benefit from functional programming concepts. If you try to program
F# the same way you program other imperative languages you won’t get much benefit.</p>

<p>If you are a C# develeoper and you want to start functional programming with F# this is the go-to book:
<em>Disclaimer: I do not know the author nor I am affiliated with the publisher by any way</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp">Functional programming in C#</a></p>

<p>Although the book is mostly about C#, it will show you how painful to do functional programming with C# and only perhaps then you can develop
some love for F#. Having that said it will also help you to understand some more new coming but confusing features of C# 9 like Records and Pattern matching.
If you think  C# records are for immutability, no they are not. They are for Value semantics and <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-referential-transparency/#:~:text=In%20functional%20programming%2C%20referential%20transparency,the%20result%20of%20the%20program.">referential transparency</a>.</p>

<p>To try F# right away you may use the following links:</p>

<p>https://try.fsharp.org/</p>

<p>https://fable.io/repl/</p>

<p>https://tryfsharp.fsbolero.io/</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>When you are unfamiliar with F# syntax, it might look a bit cryptic. And I have seen some people complained that it is very verbose. On the contrary, I would make a bold claim that F# beats most other languages when it comes to conciseness. You don’t believe me? see it your self (make sure you check all implementations)</p>

<p><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:F_Sharp">F# problems on Rosetta Code</a></p>

<h2 id="a-couple-of-toy-projects-of-mine">A couple of toy projects of mine</h2>

<p>I have developed commercial applications with F#, but as public stuff here are a couple of projects I have built. One is a full blazor/web assembly project:</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/FBlazorShop</p>

<p>And the actual app for the 3D bin packing problem, in which items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used.</p>

<p>https://github.com/OnurGumus/BinDrake</p>

<p>Trying and learning F# really requires you to dismiss your prejudices and be patient. But in the end, once you master the functional paradigm,
it makes you sleep better as a developer.</p>

			<p>I have never used WhatsApp, and never will. Despite this, I still feel the need to write an article about WhatsApp since it’s the perfect case study to help understand a class of businesses models I call “user domestication”. The domestication of users is high on my list of problems plaguing the human race, and is worth a detailed explanation.</p>
<p>WhatsApp wasn’t the first instant messenger of its kind, and probably won’t be the last. I simply chose to focus on WhatsApp since its recent privacy issues have made it a hot topic.</p>
<p>With the meta-explanation out of the way, let us begin.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-rise">WhatsApp’s rise</h2>
<p>For those unfamiliar, WhatsApp is a tool that makes it convenient and easy to help Facebook further its core mission: the optimization and auctioning of human behavior (colloquially known as “targeted advertising”). It originally persuaded people to consent to this by allowing them to send text to each other over the Internet, something that was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols">already possible</a>, and combining an easy-to-learn UI with successful marketing. It then expanded to include features such as free voice and video calls. Free calls helped it grow to become the de-facto communication platform many regions. I’m stunned at its ubiquity every time I visit my extended family in India; I’m frequently greeted by looks of confusion when I remind them that I don’t use WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Having its own proprietary chat system incompatible with other clients allowed WhatsApp to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>: WhatsApp’s existing users were held captive by the fact that leaving WhatsApp meant losing the ability to communicate with WhatsApp users. People switching from WhatsApp must convince all their friends to switch, too; this includes less technically inclined friends who had a hard time learning WhatsApp in the first place.</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp world, people who want to keep in touch must abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone can only use the proprietary WhatsApp client to send messages; developing alternative clients isn’t supported.</li>
<li>Everyone’s mobile device must run an operating system supported by said client. Since WhatsApp developers will only write a client for popular operating systems, the Android and iOS duopoly strengthens.</li>
<li>Users fully depend on WhatsApp developers. If WhatsApp developers decide to include user-hostile features in the app, users must go with it. They can’t switch to a different server or client without switching away from WhatsApp and losing the ability to communicate with all their WhatsApp contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-domestication">User domestication</h2>
<p>WhatsApp rose by trapping previously-free beings in their corral and changing their habits to create dependence on masters. Over time, this made it difficult or impossible to return to their previous lifestyle. That process should sound familiar: it’s eerily similar to the domestication of animals. I call this type of vendor lock-in <strong>user domestication:</strong> the removal of user autonomy to trap users into serving vendors.</p>
<p>I chose this metaphor because animal domestication is a gradual process that isn’t always deliberate, and typically revolves around one group becoming dependent upon another. For example: there’s evidence that domestication of dogs began with socialization, resulting in not-entirely-artificial selection promoting genes that resulted in more friendliness with and dependence upon humans.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Whether it happens on purpose or by accident, user domestication almost always follows the same three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A high level of dependence given from users to a software vendor</li>
<li>An inability for users to control their software, through at least one of the following methods:
<ol>
<li>Preventing modification of the software</li>
<li>Preventing migration onto a different platform</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The exploitation of now-captive users who are unable to resist</li>
</ol>
<p>The completion of the first two steps left WhatsApp users vulnerable to user domestication. With investors to answer to, they had every incentive to implement user-hostile features without consequence.</p>
<p>So, of course, they did.</p>
<h2 id="whatsapps-descent">WhatsApp’s descent</h2>
<p>Domestication has a purpose: it enables a master species to exploit the domesticated species for its own gain.</p>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp updated its privacy policy to allow sharing data with its parent, Facebook. Users who agreed to use WhatsApp under its previous privacy policy had two options: agree to the new policy or be unable to use WhatsApp again. The WhatsApp privacy policy update is a classic bait-and-switch: WhatsApp lured users in with a sleek interface and the impression of privacy, domesticated them to remove their autonomy to migrate, and then backtracked on its previous commitment to privacy with minimal consequence. Each step in this process enabled the next; had user domestication not taken place, it would be easy for most users to switch away with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Those of us who were sounding the alarm a few years ago experienced a brief moment of sadistic bliss when our titles were upgraded from “annoying and paranoid conspiracy theorists” to just “annoying”.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt-at-damage-control">An attempt at damage control</h3>
<p>The bait-and-switch operation incurred backlash significant enough for a noticeable minority of users to actually migrate; this number turned out to be slightly more than the rounding error WhatsApp was likely expecting. In response, WhatsApp delayed the change and published the following ad:</p>

	<img width="600" src="https://seirdy.one/p/whatsapp_ad.png" alt="WhatsApp ad describing data not collected">
</picture>

<p>The ad lists various data that WhatsApp doesn’t collect or share. Allaying data collection concerns by listing data <em>not</em> collected is misleading. WhatsApp doesn’t collect hair samples or retinal scans either; not collecting that information doesn’t mean it respects privacy because it doesn’t change the information WhatsApp <em>does</em> collect.</p>
<p>The ad denies “keep[ing] logs of who everyone is messaging or calling”. Collecting data is not the same as “keeping logs”; it’s possible for metadata to be fed into an algorithm before being discarded. A model can thus learn that two users call each other frequently without keeping logs of the metadata for each call. The fact that they specifically chose to phrase this line around logging implies that WhatsApp either already collects this class of data or has deliberately left the door open to collecting it in the future.</p>
<p>A stroll through WhatsApp’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124061525/https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">actual privacy policy</a> at the time reveals that they do collect considerable metadata used for marketing through Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="software-freedom">Software freedom</h2>
<p>With user domestication, providing useful software to users is a means to the end of exploiting them. The alternative is simple: make serving users the end in and of itself.</p>
<p>To prevent being controlled by software, users must be in control. Software that allows users to be in control is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>. The word “free” in this context refers to freedom rather than price. Software freedom is similar to the concept of open-source, but the latter is focused on practical benefits rather than ethics. A less ambiguous term that neutrally refers to both free and open-source software is <strong><abbr title="free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr></strong>.</p>
<p>Others have <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">explained</a> the concepts underpinning free software better than I can, so I won’t go into detail. It comes down to four essential freedoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-money-with-foss">Making money with FOSS</h3>
<p>The most common objection I hear is that FOSS makes it harder to make money.</p>
<p>The key to making money with FOSS is to make software a <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Complement">commoditized complement</a> of other, more profitable services. Examples of such services include selling support, customization, consulting, training, managed hosting, hardware, and certifications. Plenty of companies use this approach instead of building proprietary software: Red Hat, Collabora, System76, Purism, Canonical, SUSE, Hashicorp, Databricks, and Gradle are some names that come to mind.</p>
<p>Managed hosting isn’t a basket worth all your eggs if giants like AWS can do the same at a lower price. Being the developer can give an edge in areas like customization, support, and training; it doesn’t offer as obvious an advantage when it comes to hosting.</p>
<h2 id="foss-isnt-always-enough">FOSS isn’t always enough</h2>
<p>Free software is a necessary but sometimes insufficient requirement to build domestication immunity. Two more measures include <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>open platforms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h3>
<p>When software grows too complex, it needs to be maintained by a large team. Users who disagree with a vendor can’t easily fork and maintain a multi-million-line codebase, especially if the software in question potentially contains security vulnerabilities. Dependence on the vendor can grow quite problematic when complexity causes development costs to skyrocket; the vendor might resort to implementing user-hostile features to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Complex software that can’t be developed by a different group of people creates dependence, step one of user domestication. That alone is enough to open the door to problematic developments.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-mozilla-and-the-web">Case study: Mozilla and the Web</h4>
<p>Mozilla was a ray of hope in the browser wars, a space dominated by adtech, surveillance, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, developing a browser engine is a monumental task difficult enough for Opera and Microsoft to give up and re-skin Chromium. Browsers are more than the document readers they were meant to be: they’ve evolved into application runtimes with their own stacks for GPU acceleration, Bluetooth, permissions, device enumeration, bundled media codecs, <abbr title="digital rights management">DRM</abbr><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, extension APIs, developer tools…the list goes on. It takes billions of dollars a year to respond to vulnerabilities in such a massive attack surface and keep up with a standard that grows at such a worrying rate. Those billions have to come from somewhere.</p>
<p>Mozilla ended up having to make major compromises to stay afloat. It cut search deals with blatantly user-hostile companies, and bundled the browser with <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/">ads</a> and bloatware such as a partially …</p></section></article></div></div>

        <h2 id="github-should-start-an-app-store">GitHub Should Start An App Store</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Google suspended Elements - matrix chat app - from play store <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25965443">without any reasonable explanation</a>. I think this was an automated removal triggered by user reports or some other factors. The matrix team tried to reach out to them for explanation to no avail. We have seen this pattern in many cases now. Either it’s getting overwhelming for Google to monitor apps in its store or they don’t want apps like Elements which is decentralized to be on their store. The later mostly seems like a conspiracy theory and I think former is more true. In any case, it doesn’t make any sense for a single entity to govern what gets installed and not on billions of devices. A decentralized app store whould be best to fight this sort of suspensions but it’s far from reality at the moment. The alternative? GitHub App Store.</p>
<h3 id="but-why-github">But Why GitHub?</h3>
<p>Few reasons why I think GitHub is our best bet:</p>
<ol>
<li>They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.</li>
<li>Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during <a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">youtube-dl</a> debacle.</li>
<li>Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.</li>
<li>They could finally give the desktop the app store it deserves</li>
<li>This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.</li>
</ol>
<p>They will have to create app store applications for major platforms along with provision to host closed source applications on their store and they should be good to go. Honestly I can not imagine any other player being more successful in app stores than GitHub.</p>
<p><em>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1355663753380032512">Google has reinstated Elements</a></em></p>

        <p>There's been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood's actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that's mainly because it's a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers. </p>
<h2>First, what happened</h2>
<p>On that fateful day, Gamestop stock had massive volatility, and given the cries of "Buy!" and "Hold!" from /r/WSBs, I'd assume on Robinhood, a broker targeted at retail investors, it'd be heavily imbalanced towards buy trades.</p>
<p>As volatility increased, the DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) increased the deposit requirements for brokers. Basically, when you submit a trade on a broker, the exchange of money for stock doesn't actually happen until 2 days later, and the firm that handles that exchange is called a clearing firm. Before then, Robinhood just sends records: John bought 2 GME for $600, Mary sold 1 GME for $290. If that's all that happened that day, then Robinhood would need to provide $310 dollars to the clearing firm, and receive 1 stock.</p>
<p>That's a credit risk - what if Robinhood doesn't have the money on settlement? The clearing firm would be on the hook. So the DTCC requires that brokers put up a deposit beforehand. On that day, the DTCC massively increased the deposit requirements for brokers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesman for the DTCC wouldn’t specify how much it required from specific firms but said that by the end of the day industrywide collateral requirements jumped to $33.5 billion, up from $26 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop">Levine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week">Robinhood</a></p>
<p>So, Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. And they quickly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/robinhood-gamestop-reddit/index.html">scrounged up some capital</a> so they could continue on Friday.</p>
<h3>Robinhood's Clearing Firm</h3>
<p>Robinhood actually has their own clearing firm, Robinhood Securities... for some reason, but it's still a DTCC member and must listen to what the SEC regulates. </p>
<h3>update 12:32 - On margin?</h3>
<p>Some people seem to be mistaking the situation. It is not about margin accounts - while yes, Robinhood "instant transfers" provides the illusion of being instant effectively with margin, it's not really the issue here.</p>
<p>Brokers cannot use client money to satisfy their clearing fund obligation.  So whether or not the accounts had a settled balance didn't matter - as you can see from the other brokers which halted buys and did not have "instant transfers".</p>
<p>Again, this is about what's effectively <em>collateral</em> the brokers must put up so that all parties can mitigate the risk of a broker failing. Of course client money is used when the transaction <em>settles</em>, but, naturally, you can't use their money, which isn't yours, as collateral.</p>
<h2>But why ONLY Buys?</h2>
<p>The deposit requirement is </p>
<p><code>deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market</code></p>
<p>And the variable to look at is the 99% 2d VaR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The volatility component is designed to capture the market price risk associated with each Member’s portfolio at a 99th percentile level of confidence. The VaR Charge is the volatility component applicable to most Net Unsettled Positions, and usually comprises the largest portion of a Member’s Required Deposit. Procedure XV of the Rules currently provides that the VaR Charge shall be calculated in accordance with a generally accepted portfolio volatility margin model utilizing assumptions based on reasonable historical data and an appropriate volatility range. As such, NSCC currently calculates a Member’s VaR Charge utilizing the VaR model, which incorporates an EWMA volatility
estimation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf">SEC</a></p>
<p>Remember when I subtracted John's buys of $600 with Mary's sell of $290 to get $310? That's the broker's net unsettled cash positions. The 99% VaR is basically, "99% of the time the broker's net unsettled will not be higher than X". You might remember if you took statistics about confidence intervals; this is the upper 99% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>Bad Desmos Graphs</h3>
<p>So, let's model our risk as a Normal curve, for simplicity's sake. Here I've graphed a normal distribution with a line representing the 95% percentile</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Y axis is probability, the X axis is Robinhood's net unsettled positions. The more positive, the more money they'd owe theoretically.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if more people buy than sell? Then it'd shift over to the right</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r2" alt=""></p>
<p>Hasn't the 95% percentile moved rightward as well? Now, what happens if the market is super volatile (i.e, the std dev of the distribution increases)</p>
<p><img src="https://stu2b50.dev/images/get/why-robinhood-d3580b/r3" alt=""></p>
<p>Wow, now it's even more to the right! </p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>buys make this worse</strong>, <strong>sells make it better</strong>. Robinhood <em>could not</em> execute buys, because it would increase the deposits they'd need, which they legally must obligate by.  Sells, on the other hand, do not have this problem. They would not push the 95% boundary more to the right.</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>So really, it's not a bad decision or good decision that Robinhood halted buys of GME - it wasn't a decision, and it wasn't something they alone did.</p>
<p>These brokers halted buys of GME</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood</li>
<li>Webull</li>
<li>M1 Finance</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>E-Trade</li>
</ul>
<p>While others only halted options</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive</li>
<li>TDA</li>
<li>Schwab</li>
<li>Tradeing212</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmm, see a pattern? The former group includes companies like Robinhood (2013), WeBull (2017), M1 Finance (2015), while the latter has TDA (1975), Schwab(1971), Trading212 (2004).</p>
<p>(Okay, E-Trade is actually old too, but I guess they're just cash-strapped right now?)</p>
<p>Looks like young brokers with a limited capital resources to me.</p>
<h2>Stay or Switch?</h2>
<p>If there's something to fault Robinhood, it's that they're a young, janky broker (and also you might be getting screwed on the spread by Citadel). If they had more money on-hand they might not have had to stop buys of Gamestop. Perhaps they should have expected this and raised more capital earlier. </p>
<p>And that's a real reason to stay away from Robinhood. But for the love of god do not swap to WeBull or something if that's your concern.</p>
<p>And don't do it because you're abhorred by Robinhood's class warfare or something. Because that didn't happen - it was a mixture of SEC regulations and a cash-strapped startup (well, cash-strapped on big broker scales).</p>
<p>Although if you want to get mad at Hedge Funds anyway, feel free! You should always be mad at Hedge Funds. But please pick a real reason - you have no lack of choice to pick from.</p>

          <section><p>Online retailers know a lot about how their customers are navigating their virtual stores. Offline retailers are not so&nbsp;lucky.</p>
<p>Together with consumer behavior experts <a href="https://b-clarity.com/2020/01/08/what-is-the-role-of-touching-in-store/" target="_blank">B:Clarity</a> and a multinational home appliance brand we built a system to help understand customer movement and&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>The system consists of wireless sensors that are installed in electronics stores. A few hundred sensors in each&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>There are two types of&nbsp;sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vibration sensors. That trigger when someone is trying out a&nbsp;product.</li>
<li>Light sensors. Trigger when someone is standing in front of a&nbsp;product.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these sensors, we can see what items are most popular, how it correlates to sales data – and how to take action to improve&nbsp;sales.</p>
<p>But without collecting any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">personally identifiable information</a>.</p>
<p>This is what the sensors look&nbsp;like:</p>

<h2 id="why-monitor-shoppers-">Why monitor&nbsp;shoppers?</h2>
<p>Online retailers and e-commerce has many ways to gain insight into their customers. Examples include seeing the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items</a>, and the <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/behaviour-reports#top-online-store-searches-with-no-results" target="_blank">toplist of searched-for items with no results</a>.</p>
<p>Physical retailers don’t want to be left&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>So many different ways to monitor shoppers in physical stores have been&nbsp;developed.</p>
<p>Amazon Go stores extensively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/" target="_blank">use cameras</a> to track everything that happens inside their&nbsp;stores.</p>
<p>Many stores provide free WiFi so that they can <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/wi-fi-tracking-a-data-gold-mine-or-privacy-nightmare/572937/" target="_blank">track their customers</a>.</p>
<p>All these solutions have a big problem:&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Cameras see everything – much more than they need. And this data is collected and stored. Free WiFi hotspots may capture all kinds of&nbsp;traffic.</p>
<p>This is an obvious privacy problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>But it is not just a problem for the&nbsp;shoppers.</p>
<p>It also creates a major problem for the companies storing the data: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/silicon-valley-terrified-california-privacy-law/" target="_blank">personally identifiable data is a liability</a>.</p>
<p>This is why we chose vibration sensors and light sensors. No liability from owning any personally identifiable&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>With only vibration and light, there simply is nothing there to identify individual&nbsp;shoppers.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-shopper-behavior">Understanding shopper&nbsp;behavior</h2>
<p>As a shopper, you want to find the best products, and – ideally – pay the lowest possible&nbsp;price.</p>
<p>The retailers and producers have slightly different&nbsp;motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands want customer to buy their products, and not their&nbsp;competitors’</li>
<li>Retailers want to sell more&nbsp;products</li>
</ul>
<p>And when the motivations of shoppers, retailers, and brands align, business is made. And the more business, the better for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Understanding customer behavior is key to improving the experience for&nbsp;everyone.</p>
<p>The sensors detect when people are looking at items. And they report this immediately, so that we can see in real-time where shoppers&nbsp;are.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-wireless-iot-mesh-network-">Why use a wireless IoT mesh&nbsp;network?</h2>
<p>A wireless mesh network is a wireless network that automatically extend its&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh network solution uses so-called <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/what-is-subghz-networking/" target="_blank">sub-GHz wireless technology</a> that has way better range than traditional WiFi or&nbsp;Bluetooth.</p>
<p>But even with a longer range, it is not always&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Electronics stores can be very large. And there is plenty of metal inside them that hampers the wireless&nbsp;coverage.</p>
<p>A mesh network is the ideal technology in these&nbsp;situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Coverage</strong>. Electronics stores can be huge. With a mesh network, we can cover it&nbsp;all.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It just works</strong>. No network planning is&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to install</strong>. Just put each device where it should&nbsp;be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Easy to maintain</strong>. If there are issues with coverage, just add extenders as&nbsp;needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Robustness</strong>. If something changes, the network will automatically adapt and&nbsp;overcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the wireless mesh network typically looks&nbsp;like:</p>

<p>In this deployment, the mesh network used one access point and two extenders. Most device are able to reach the access point directly, but some chose to talk to one of the&nbsp;extenders.</p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery&nbsp;life</h2>
<p>The sensors are equipped with batteries: one coin-cell battery&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>The Thingsquare IoT mesh system is <a href="https://www.thingsquare.com/blog/articles/sensortag-power/" target="_blank">tailored for extreme low-power operation</a>. Extreme low-power operation in this case means that the sensors can go for several months one a single&nbsp;charge.</p>
<p>For example, the sensors are automatically turned off at night, to conserve their precious&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the Thingsquare system continuously collects power consumption data from each and every&nbsp;sensor.</p>
<p>This data lets us see the exact behavior at any given time: are there any sensors that behave in a way that require their batteries to be replaced earlier? The Thingsquare system knows the answers to this, and alerts us if this would be the&nbsp;case.</p>

<p>The ioT mesh network is connected to the Internet via a 4G modem. The network maintains a stable encrypted connection to the backend system so that the devices always can be&nbsp;reached.</p>

Broadly speaking, it is an attempt to give you an opportunity to take a look at Rome as it really was, by the eyes of humans who lived there in that time. Due to this, we are already paying much attention (and will proceed) to the level of details, adding realistic materials, colors, visual and weather effects. That’s why we are concentrating just on the center of the Rome for now, just to focus on quality and details.</p><p>Now we are planning to add a little additional territory (such as Circus Maximus, Velabrum area), and release our project as a 3d walkthrough application. I hope we will be able to complete it in a year approximately.</p> <img src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" data-src="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" data-srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" srcset="https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt.jpg 1600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-600x338.jpg 600w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-768x432.jpg 768w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://relivehistoryin3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Enscape_2019-10-16-22-47-45_opt-400x225.jpg 400w"><p>Boasting some impressive in-video lighting features, the animation focuses on the monumental scale that was flaunted by Rome during its apical architectural stage.

<p>First occurrence on <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Winter" title="Eth0:2010 Winter">eth0:2010 Winterlan</a>, the LackRack is the ultimate, low-cost, high shininess solution for your modular datacenter-in-the-living-room. Featuring the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270">LACK</a> (side table) from Ikea, the LackRack is an easy-to-implement, exact-fit datacenter building block.
It's a little known fact that we have seen Google engineers tinker with Lack tables since way back in 2009.
</p><p>The LackRack will certainly make its appearance again this summer at <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/Eth0:2010_Summer" title="Eth0:2010 Summer">eth0:2010 Summer</a>.

Its low-cost and perfect fit are great for mounting up to 8 U of 19" hardware, such as switches (see below), or perhaps other 19" gear. It's very easy to assemble, and thanks to the design, they are stable enough to hold (for example) 19" switches and you can put your bottle of Club-Mate on top! Multi-shiny LackRack can also be painted to your specific preferences and the airflow is unprecedented!
</p>
<p>You can find a howto on buying a LackRack on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mrngm.com/eth0/LackRack/">this page</a>. This includes the proof that a 19" switch can indeed be placed in the LackRack in its natural habitat!
</p>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:5x_lackrack.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/9/99/5x_lackrack.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" data-file-width="800" data-file-height="800"></a></p><div><p>Illustration of the LackRack's modularity</p></div></div></div><p><i>For assembly in terms of a programming language, this is not the page you need.</i>
</p><p>However, in order to assemble the LackRack, there are a few prerequisites or tools that are needed:
</p>
<ul><li>1 (or more) LACK side table from Ikea</li>
<li>Screwdriver (whether muscle-driven or motor-driven, with preference of the latter)</li>
<li>Wood screws (they should fit in the rack mounts on your appliance, and not exceed 1" in length)</li>
<li>Spare time</li></ul>
<p>That's all! First, follow the assembly instructions in the Ikea manual in order to assemble the LACK.
After that, the installation of your 19" hardware can begin. When assembling a larger number of LACKs, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/IKEA_Hack_a_Lack/">this link</a> describes a useful tool for fitting the legs to the tabletop.
</p><p>The LackRack is a stackable modular product. Additional elements can be stacked on top easily. Brackets to secure the top element to the bottom one are not included but available from your local non-computer hardware store.
</p>
<ul><li>If you put several LackRacks side by side, the higher levels can be staggered to form a pyramid. This feature is not present in any other of the commercially available rack products.</li></ul>

<div><div><p><a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lackrack2.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://wiki.eth0.nl/images/7/76/Lackrack2.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="400" data-file-width="1536" data-file-height="2048"></a></p><div><p>Due to their light weight design, Lackracks will grow to any required size without compromise</p></div></div></div>
<p>Installing hardware in your LackRack is easy!
</p>
<ul><li><i>Optional but recommended</i> - Put the table on its side (which one is your decision) or upside down</li>
<li>Mount the hardware between the left and right leg
<ul><li>If you mount the first item, it is recommended to install it against the table top for good fit. This happens automatically if you have the LackRack upside down, except in zero gravity environments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Screw all the screws that fit in the rack mount in the left and right leg (for stability).
<ul><li>With deep units, a Z-shaped bracket may be advisable to secure the rear of the unit against the underside of the tabletop.</li></ul></li>
<li>&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Profit! (note how <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rackable.com/">lackable.com</a> has been bought by sgi recently)</li></ul>
<h2><span id="Note">Note</span></h2>
<p>Current LACK tables have hollow legs; only the top 5 cm (2") is solid. Fitting equipment below the solid section may require the use of cavity plugs, such as <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fischer-international.com/en/products/cavity-fixings/board-fixing/metal-cavity-fixing-hm/519772-hm-5-x-37-s">these</a>
</p>
<h2><span id="Goodies">Goodies</span></h2>
<ul><li>You can put food and/or drink on your rack.</li>
<li>You can put a small lamp on top of the rack to see your hardware and/or better find the aforementioned food and drink.</li>
<li>The table can be painted in a color of your preference, or decorated in various ways. The eth0 Design team can advise, for a fee, how to optimally decorate the rack to suit your environment.
<ul><li>That means, no more dull black/gray racks!</li>
<li>Or you can put <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/File:Lack2.jpg" title="File:Lack2.jpg">stickers of your favorite event</a> on them.</li></ul></li>
<li>It's easy to colour-code your datacentre: e.g. <span>red</span> for critical services, <span>grey</span> for office automation, <span>green</span> for file-servers, <span>black</span> for systems and network management.</li>

<ul><li>Q: Does the LackRack provide redundant power supply?
<ul><li>A: Only if you add it yourself</li></ul></li>
<li>Q: Can I put my (coffee) mug on top and don't have to worry about it if I spill liquid on the LackRack?
<ul><li>A: You can spill coffee on the LackRack, since it can be cleaned quite easily. However, if you have appliances <b>in</b> the LackRack, there is a chance that these appliances cannot handle the coffee (or any other liquid). You should take precautions in order to protect your appliances</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ikea.com/nl/nl/catalog/products/00095036">Ikea LACK coffee table</a>: almost twice as deep, and comes with a shelf. Its size allows both short ends to be used as rack space simultaneously. It's interesting to note that Ikea photographed it from the side; an uncommon artistic approach to 19" server rack photography.
It provides for 8 U of hardware: 4 on either side of the shelf.
</p><p>Following ICT tradition, the Enterprise Edition is more than three times as expensive, while providing less stability than two of the regular products combined.

<p>It is clear that Ikea has strived to keep many of their products
rack compatible since so many of them are capable of housing 19"
equipment. See <a href="https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/List_of_IkeaRacks" title="List of IkeaRacks">List_of_IkeaRacks</a>

In case you aren’t familiar with the term “data warehouse”, it’s basically a database that centralizes your data to be used for analysis. There are many databases you can choose from, for example in Simon Willison’s talk, he uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. I chose <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> because I’m familiar with it and so far I have liked what Ive seen. Some features that make it stand out for me are things like <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html">time travel</a>, <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/undrop-table.html">undrop table</a>, a rich set of <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/intro-summary-operators-functions.html">functions</a>, among many others.</p><p>Ok great, so we now have an empty database to start with. But a database is only useful when there is data in it to query. So we must choose which datasets to pull into our freshly minted database. I’m going to start with bringing in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> data because I’m a big fan of the site and it has an actual <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API">API</a> which means we wont have to be scraping HTML. I’m also going to bring in stock data into the warehouse to see if we can get any stock information out of Hacker News. Finally we’ll analyze the stock market and correlate stocks to the latest GameStop stock craze.</p><p>The first part of the plan will be to get the Hacker News data loaded into Snowflake. Then I’ll use Snowflake’s Data Marketplace to bring in the stock data, which will save me from writing an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform).</p><h2>Getting an initial dump of the Hacker News data.</h2><p>I wanted to write as little code as possible to get this initial historical dump of Hacker News so I decided to use a combination of curl, bash and parallel to get the job done. I first used <a href="https://ec2instances.info/">ec2instances.info</a> to find a relatively cheap CPU per dollar machine. I spun up a c5a.8xlarge on AWS which has 32 vCPUs.<br>I wouldn’t be surprised if there were cheaper options, but I just eyeballed it.</p><p>Let’s get the largest item ID:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611791428293_3993"><div><pre><code>curl https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/maxitem.json</code></pre></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611792427454_4138"><div><p>Which returned: 25,806,058</p><p>Sigh, looks like we’re going to have to do 25 million HTTP calls.

This script can be run without user intervention and will keep the data up-to-date. Using Python to write the ELT gave me more flexibility to fix some things that I saw as issues. For example, the script starts N * 4 (where N is the number of logical cpus) jobs and only produces N * 4 files instead of 1 file per item. This approach will avoid having to do an expensive file combination step at the end. I also added some awesome progress bars to the script so that I knew how many requests remain thanks to <a href="https://github.com/alphatwirl/atpbar/issues/21#issuecomment-766468695">Tai Sakuma</a>.</p><p>Running this script from my laptop (a Dell 9370 Developer Edition with 8 logical cores) and spotty Wi-Fi, script extracts items from the API at about 130 items/second. This is slower than extracting from a c5a.8xlarge machine, but at least my laptop isn’t charging me $1.232/hour for using it. And my script has the benefit of not having to combine millions of tiny files at the end. Let’s test my incremental loading script out on an ec2 instance to see how it really compares with my naive approach.</p><h2>Downloading incremental data from Hacker News using my script</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1611883239126_31321"><div><pre><code>$ time { poetry run python main.py ; }

<p><em>Update: large parts of this story may, in fact, be fiction. See the addendum at the end for details.</em></p>
<p>Film rights are a strange and complex thing, especially when it comes to existing properties. The contracts for these things can involve a labyrinthine series of clauses and negotiations, where the owners of the original property want to include cut-off clauses that will enable them to claw back the rights and sell them again, possibly for much more money if the adaptation has been a success, the artistic creator wants to hold on to some level of creative control and the film studio wants to ensure that neither of those things happens. We’ve seen assorted shenanigans at work across the board – the <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2018/08/30/big-bond-themes-and-secret-agent-cover-versions/">James Bond</a> copyright snafu that saw the film rights for <strong>Casino Royale</strong> owned and exploited by another company than the one that made the official series, and perhaps most famously in terms of contractual obligations, the first <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> movie, made as a low-budget throwaway affair simply to ensure that the film rights stayed with Constantin Film, who was not quite ready to make a ‘proper’ version of the story but who saw the potential in the property and didn’t want to let it go.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most absurd of these contractual obligation projects came with <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, which was adapted into a TV series that ran for four seasons – which would suggest a major hit show by 1970s television standards, except for the fact that it never aired. Not a single episode beyond the pilot was shown on TV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> was a major hit in 1974 and remains one of the most beloved Hollywood comedies – well, perhaps not with Millenials and Generation Z, given the film’s rather liberal use of the sort of racist language that is now strictly forbidden, even in context. Mel Brooks’ comedy western mocked American racism brutally – perhaps a little too brutally in the use of one particular word, which is bandied about throughout the film. It was a different time.</p>

<p>Brooks was on fire as a filmmaker in 1974, and there was every reason to expect <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> to be a massive hit, as indeed it was. Having dealt with studios enough by this point, Brooks knew that they might want to take the project away from him and produce sequels – the story essentially opened itself up for on-going narratives. And so he came up with a cunning plan. The contracts for the film stated that there could only be film sequels if a TV series follow-up was made within six months. Brooks and his legal team were pretty certain that the film was too profane and vulgar to ever be adapted as a TV series. I mean, what could they do? Strip it back to its most basic elements while throwing out everything that made the film what it was?</p>
<p>Well, that was precisely what happened. In 1977, Warner Brothers announced plans for a sequel film – in fact, a series of sequels – to <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and when Brooks and his lawyers waved the contract at them, they pulled their ace card – a four-season series based on the original film that had gone into production very quickly in 1974. As Brooks explained, <em>“Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another Blazing Saddles, and I say, ‘No. You don’t have the right to do that.’ They say, ‘Yes we do, we’ve been making a TV series and still control the rights.’ What TV series? I haven’t seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it.”</em></p>
<p>You have to almost admire Warner Brothers’ gall here, and – oddly – their belief in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>. Not only did they rush a series into production in 1974, but they kept it in production – because the contract only allowed a new movie within six months of the last <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> project – for four years until they finally had a movie ready. TV shows might be cheaper than films, but nevertheless, imagine how much they had to spend, making four seasons of a show just to hold onto the film rights.</p>
<p>In fact, the pilot episode of <strong>Black Bart</strong>, as the series is called, was shown once in 1975 on CBS, with no one even noticing. Well, why would they? As well as changing the title (because the contract also failed to state that any TV series be <em>called</em> <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>), Brooks wasn’t credited, with Andrew Bergman, who originally came up with the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> idea listed as creator. The show starred Louis Gossett Jr as Sheriff Bart, continuing his battles against both criminals and racists, while the other film characters were replaced with similar, but not identical characters to avoid crediting Brooks. Both the cast – including Gerrit Graham – and the characters are lightweight versions of the originals, the humour is almost non-existent and the laugh track just hammers home how unfunny the show is. And yet it is a professional work, and arguably no less forced than several other sitcoms of the era. So the question is: why didn’t they just put in a bit more effort and then show the damn thing instead of paying everyone to shoot twenty-four episodes that would sit, unseen, in the Warner Brothers vaults?</p>

<p>Presumably, the answer is that a TV show – even a good TV show – would have diluted the appeal of another film. The 1970s were a different time (we mentioned that, right?) and there was less crossover of film and TV – sure, some films – like <a href="https://reprobatepress.com/2020/09/27/go-ape-the-planet-of-the-apes-book-and-comics-of-the-1970s/"><strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></a> – were adapted into TV shows, but those shows were rarely successful and were seen as having essentially killed off any chance of audiences then going to the cinema to watch a movie version. If anything, <strong>Black Bart</strong> might have served as a sign of just how bad a Mel Brooks-free version of <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> could be. So instead of putting any effort into making a decent TV series based on the property (and there’s certainly the potential there), Warner Brothers simply put the least possible effort into making something that would still legally stand up as a TV show that could, in theory, be broadcast – and then buried it.</p>
<p>What the cast and crew thought of all this is hard to gauge – Gossett has talked about the weirdness of it all, but you have to wonder just how anyone managed to drum up any enthusiasm once it became clear that the show would never air. Ironically, the plans for a <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> sequel ultimately went nowhere – by 1979, it was clear that the moment had passed and audience tastes had changed. The sequel was shelved, and the series was finally cancelled. The pilot episode has since turned up on the <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong> DVD and blu-ray, but the other episodes have yet to be seen. It’s entirely possible that they were never even completed beyond the ones shown to Brooks, and may have been trashed. A pity, as we’ll never know if it accidentally improved.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> We feel it’s important to point out that some sources are claiming since we originally posted this that the entire story – with the exception of the<strong> Black Bart</strong> pilot, which definitely exists and is perhaps a weird enough thing in itself – is in fact a spoof that has somehow become accepted as reality – ‘fake news’, as I believe it is known. There are several sources online claiming that this story is authentic; others claiming that it is satire (links appear in the comments). Unless Mel Brooks – or perhaps Louis Gossett – wants to come clean on the actual facts, it perhaps remains a mystery. Stranger-than-fiction may, or may not, be actual fiction, and isn’t that depressing when it’s a story as good as this? As Tony Wilson said (or possibly didn’t say, there’s the rub), <em>“when&nbsp;you have to choose between the truth and the legend, choose the legend.”</em></p>
