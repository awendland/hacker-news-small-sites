<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure> <figcaption>I know you want to. - Photo by Author </figcaption></figure> <p>You might not be aware of it, but you use some form of open source software every single day.</p> <p>Every time you start an app on your phone or launch a program on your computer, you profit from the code that someone has written for free.</p> <p>WordPress, the largest and most well-known content management system, is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" rel="nofollow">38% of all websites</a> worldwide. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>Linux is powering <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux" rel="nofollow">30% of all websites</a> globally. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.</p> <p>These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.</p> <p>But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">State of the Octoverse report</a> by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new&nbsp;users joined in 2019 alone!</p> <p>The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.</p> <p>Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.</p> <p>Do you feel the same way?</p> <p>Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.</p> <h2>You can learn a lot from the source code</h2> <p>Since the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.</p> <p>Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.</p> <p>Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.</p> <p>Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.</p> <h2>You will work with the smartest people</h2> <p>Compared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.</p> <p>In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.</p> <p>The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.</p> <p>A good example is the well-known code editor <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.</p> <p>You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.</p> <p>When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.</p> <h2>Your own code could be used globally</h2> <p>Since some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.</p> <p>I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn" rel="nofollow">eslint-plugin-unicorn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte" rel="nofollow">svelte</a>. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.</p> <p>From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.</p> <h2>Open source projects are inclusive</h2> <p>A great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.</p> <p>While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.</p> <p>Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.</p> <h2>Projects are starting to become sustainable</h2> <p>The main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.</p> <p>Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.</p> <p>With websites like <a href="https://opencollective.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCollective</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" rel="nofollow">GitHub Sponsors</a>, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.</p> <p>Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.</p> <h2>How to contribute to open source</h2> <p>Contributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.</p> <p>Don’t know where to start?</p> <p>Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?</p> <p>It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.</p> <p>It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.</p> <p>The <code>README.md</code> file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.</p> <p>If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://markushatvan.com/blog/contributing-to-open-source-projects-the-right-way">Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way</a>. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.</p> <p>I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!</p> <h2>Wrapping up</h2> <p>It always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.</p> <p>And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.</p> <p>I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!</p> <p>Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.</p> <h2>Helpful resources</h2> <ul><li><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">The State of the Octoverse</a></li> <li><a

December 26, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;
                                                           QUERY PLAN

<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public. Stay informed on jailbreak releases by following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak subreddit</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">exhaustive list of jailbreak compatibility</a> by device and iOS version is also a great resource.</p><p>It's also useful to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Untethered_jailbreak">untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-untethered_jailbreak">semi-untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-tethered_jailbreak">semi-tethered</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">tethered</a> jailbreaks.</p><h3 id="recognize-that-this-may-not-work">Recognize that this may not work</h3><p>Depending on your iPhone, you might never be able to jailbreak it or extract Signals decryption key from the iOS Keychain.

If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments. This archive can reach several gigabytes.</p><pre><code>root# cd /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/
root# zip -r signal-backup.zip &lt;Signal directory&gt;

For example, an app needs the HomeKit Entitlement — along with explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of its binary executable.</blockquote><p><strong>Enter Keychain Dumper</strong></p><p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper"><strong>Keychain-Dumper</strong></a> to attempt extracting the Signal encryption key. It requires entitlements to access Keychain data for any particular app. </p><p>Reading through Keychain-Dumper's GitHub issues, I learned that entitlements changed in iOS 13.5 – prior to this version, an application <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/issues/52#issuecomment-638174691">could be given wildcard entitlements</a>. Changes in 13.5 made it such that apps need specific entitlements. Thankfully, it's possible to update an executable's entitlements, even as a binary.</p><p>The <code>keychain_dumper</code> binary included in its <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper">GitHub repo</a> has wildcard entitlements. We'll need to update them in order to give it permission to decrypt the Signal key.</p><p><strong>Install Keychain Dumper on the iPhone</strong></p><p>Back on the iPhone, download and extract the <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/tag/1.0.0">keychain_dumper binary</a>, and move it to <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p><pre><code>root# wget https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/download/1.0.0/keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip

	<hr>
	<p>In 2020, <strong>Docker is the best medium for distributing and running most developer-facing software</strong>. It’s widely accepted that Docker is great for building and deploying the artifacts for your enterprise web app, but this is less well known when it comes to things like developer tools. However, running tools in containers has many benefits over installing and running them in the conventional way, and we should all start doing it more.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I install very few things on either my personal or work computer. I don’t have <code>terraform</code>, <code>aws</code>, <code>node</code>, or <code>pip</code> installed, but I use them all the time. I have a Docker image for each, and I run them in containers with minimal privileges. I’m definitely <a href="https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles">not the only one</a>, but it’s not as popular as it should be. None of these tools actually need full access to my computer to do their work, but that is normally how they’re run.</p>
<p>Here are some benefits of running these tools in Docker.</p>
<h4 id="cross-platform">Cross-platform</h4>
<p>At this point in time, Docker is ubiquitous and you get cross-platform support for free, thanks to Docker Inc’s investments in that area (Docker for Mac &amp; Windows). This is useful both for people developing/distributing tools, and for people working on a team that needs to share tooling. You have one Docker image and it will run pretty much everywhere. OS package managers can be great, but they’re very much not cross-platform. Things like <code>pip install</code> will sometimes work cross-platform, but have other serious drawbacks.</p>
<p>While every platform has its own sandboxing mechanisms, running with Docker lets you specify runtime context and enforce a sandbox in a cross-platform way, which is useful when you expect anybody else to run the same command as you.</p>
<h4 id="sandboxed">Sandboxed</h4>
<p>When you <code>docker run</code>, you have to be explicit about privileges. A container is mostly sandboxed and unprivileged by default. It doesn’t have access to ambient environment variables. It doesn’t have access to the host system’s disk. A tool like <code>jq</code> just needs to read stdin and print to stdout. It doesn’t need access to my shell’s environment variables (or, if it does, I explicitly pass those through to the container). <code>yarn</code> should be fine operating on just the working directory, and maybe a cache directory. I don’t want it to have access to my ~/.aws directory (for <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/01/malicious-npm-package-exfiltrating-data-from-unix-systems/">obvious reasons</a>).</p>
<p>Some tools do need access to things. I want my <code>aws</code> CLI to be able to read ~/.aws, so I grant that explicitly. This makes running the tool more verbose but less magical.</p>
<h4 id="simple-uniform-interface">Simple, uniform interface</h4>
<p>Running a program in a container is a lot like running it normally, but the user doesn’t need to jump through hoops to configure the system, build and install. The developer of the image jumps through those hoops and produces a runnable artifact with a simple interface. That interface is the same whether the tool was written in Python or Rust or C or anything else.</p>
<p>Downloading a pre-compiled binary is almost like this, except with worse odds. Maybe there’s a build for your architecture. If it was statically linked, you’re golden. Otherwise, use <code>ldd</code> to reverse engineer the fact that you need to install <code>libjpeg</code>.</p>
<p>A Docker image “just works”. It comes bundled with what it needs to run.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it’s pretty strange to execute <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/tree/0b3d9a4260fdda5c6a8b736439e0776bc2252f41#installation"><code>pip install awscli</code></a>. It’s immaterial to an end user that the tool is written in Python, and requiring him or her to set up and use Python tooling doesn’t make sense. I don’t mean to pick on <code>pip</code> or <code>awscli</code> in particular, but this is a poor mechanism for distributing non-library software. It leaves <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+pip">far too much to chance</a>. It’s a clumsy and leaky interface for tool distribution. So is <code>npm install</code>. So is telling somebody to install your tool by installing golang, and then running <code>go build</code>. No, thanks. If I’m hacking on the project, then by all means. But don’t foist that on end users.</p>
<h4 id="facilitates-version-pinning">Facilitates version pinning</h4>
<p>When collaborating, it’s important that people run the same versions of software to get consistent results. Version pinning is essential to that. Pinning dependency manifests is good, but it’s not enough: it only covers the one situation of installing things with a language package manager. It may not cover using the same linter version, or the same version of <code>node</code>, <code>aws</code>, <code>ansible</code>, <code>terraform</code>, or any libraries installed at the OS level. Invoking <code>docker run node:13.10.1</code>, instead of whatever the user happens to have installed as <code>node</code>, solves this problem in general. Having the ability to specify the versions at the point of use, rather than out-of-band as part of some other installation process, is also convenient and tidy.</p>
<p>It’s easy to run different versions of a tool side by side with Docker. Docker solves this more generally than things like virtualenv for Python, rvm for Ruby, etc. You specify what version of the tool to use when you’re invoking it, and it pins a whole lot of context more than just the tool’s version, which is always preferable for reproducibility.</p>
<p>In one recent situation at work, we had a test case start failing when we upgraded our runtime from Python 3.6.5 to Python 3.6.8. Having the ability to easily run the tests with any version of Python made it easy to bisect and identify a change in 3.6.7 as the cause. This could have been debugged without Docker, but it was particularly natural and easy with Docker.</p>
<h4 id="reproducible">Reproducible</h4>
<p>Invoking a tool with <code>docker run</code> should specify everything needed to reproducibly run it somewhere else. It’s running some specific version of the tool? Okay. It needs my AWS credentials? Okay. It needs some specific combination of environment variables set? Okay.</p>
<p>I cringe when I see a Makefile or build instructions saying to run <code>yarn</code> or <code>terraform</code> or <code>go</code>. What version? What’s being assumed about my environment? Maybe this worked on your <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html">unique snowflake of a machine</a> 18 months ago, but good luck with it now. (My laptop is a unique snowflake too. Everyone’s is, until we all figure out how to use NixOS.)</p>
<p>Running tools in Docker, there are few expectations of the runtime environment beyond having Docker installed. All the other requirements should be made explicit in the <code>docker run</code> command. The command that you’re running locally will work the same on your colleague’s machine, and in any CI with minimal configuration (or none). This is absolutely critical, especially when working on a team. This is a far more robust approach than expecting (requiring) anybody’s system, or a CI slave, to be set up “just so”.</p>

<p>I have very few things installed on my host system beyond the base OS. There’s less to remember when setting up a new machine, fewer things to go wrong during upgrades, and fewer opportunities for conflicts over shared libraries.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h4 id="one-offs">One-offs</h4>
<p>I have bash aliases for a bunch of tools that I run all the time. These are just for my own convenience. For anything shared with other people, I’d use a project’s Makefile (see below).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Some basics</strong></p>
<pre><code>alias aws='docker run --rm -v ~/.aws:/.aws -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" -u 1000:1000 -e AWS_PROFILE mikesir87/aws-cli:1.18.11 aws'
alias jq='docker run -i --rm jess/jq jq'
alias terraform='docker run -it --rm -v ~/.aws:/.aws -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" -w "$(pwd)" -u 1000:1000 hashicorp/terraform:0.12.23'
</code></pre><p>With these aliases, I can <code>AWS_PROFILE=... aws sts get-caller-identity | jq -r .Arn</code> as if they were “really” installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zoom</strong></p>
<p>Here’s zoom (video conferencing):</p>
<pre><code>alias zoom='xhost +local:docker \
    &amp;&amp; docker run -it --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY \
    --device /dev/video0 --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd --device /dev/dri -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm \
    -v ~/.config/zoom/.zoom:/root/.zoom -v ~/.config/zoom/.config/zoomus.conf:/root/.config/zoomus.conf \
    jess/zoom-us'
</code></pre><p>Notice that <a href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5">port 19421</a> remains stubbornly closed unless we explicitly let the container claim it on the host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Snes9x</strong></p>
<p>I do this with other stuff, too. Here’s Snes9x (can you imagine <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?t=23603">installing it</a>?):</p>
<pre><code>alias snes9x='docker run -it --rm -u 1000:1000 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY \
    -v /run/dbus:/run/dbus -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm \

    -e PULSE_SERVER=unix:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/native -v $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/native:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/pulse/native \

    -v ~/.config/snes9x:/.snes9x/ -v ~/Games/SNES:/SNES -v ~/.local/share:/.local/share \

</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>
<p>For things that are project-specific, or in a team setting, all useful commands should be codified in something like a Makefile. This wraps the complexity and verbosity of the <code>docker run</code> incantations, makes it possible to share them easily, and makes them passably ergonomic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>hugo</strong></p>
<p>When I’m writing an article for this site, I run <code>make hugo-watch</code> and load http://localhost:1313 in a web browser:</p>
<pre><code>hugo = docker run --rm -u $$(id -u):$$(id -g) -v "$$(pwd)":/src -v "$$(pwd)"/output:/target $(2) klakegg/hugo:0.54.0-ext-alpine $(1)

hugo-watch:
    mkdir -p output
    $(call hugo, server, -it -p 1313:1313)
</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p><strong>prettier</strong></p>
<p>To format a JavaScript project, we might have the make targets</p>
<pre><code>prettier = docker run -i --rm -v "$$(pwd)":"$$(pwd)" -w "$$(pwd)" elnebuloso/prettier:1.19.1 $(1) "src/**/*.js"

format:
    $(call prettier)

format-check:
    $(call prettier, --check)
</code></pre><p>We would run <code>make format</code> to format the code and <code>make format-check</code> to check the style. It runs on my Linux box, it runs on my colleague’s Mac, and it runs in any Docker-equipped CI. None of those machines need to have <code>node</code>, <code>npm</code>, or <code>prettier</code> installed. We completely trivialize the issues of versioning and of synchronizing our environments: the version is specified once, here in the Makefile, and it’s obeyed everywhere.</p>
<p>In a language like Python, where libraries are forced to fight to the death for control of transitive dependency versions, lifting a tool like <code>black</code> or <code>flake8</code> out of the project’s requirements.txt, and into a self-contained Docker image, can be a big …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

    <p>The past few months have seen a rise in volatility along the Indo-Tibetan border, with the forces of both India and China coming to blows. While these events are extraordinary in present times, the border has witnessed far more heated exchanges, most notably during the 1962 <a href="https://www.livehistoryindia.com/in-the-news/2020/06/21/across-the-karakorams">Indo-China</a> War.</p><p>The unforgiving terrain that marks the frontier creates an additional dimension to the already complex nature of these clashes, whether in regard to more conventional manoeuvres, or other irregular military activity which is far more frequent. This is the story of the latter kind of action, that of daring espionage against Communist China, played for the highest stakes with the greatest risks.</p>

Straddling between the <a href="https://www.livehistoryindia.com/snapshort-histories/2017/06/21/kumaon-echoes-of-the-past">Kumaon</a> and Garhwal districts of Uttarakhand, deep in the Himalayas, stands Nanda Devi. The second-highest mountain in India, towering at an astonishing 25,646 feet, it is named after the patron goddess of Uttarakhandâ€” the mountain being her temporal manifestation.</p><p>Its unique topographical environment makes it one of the most inaccessible places on Earth. Surrounded on three sides by massive mountain rampartsâ€”its natural fortifications measuring at no point below 17,000 feetâ€” only the narrow and dangerously steep Rishi Ganga river gorge allows access to it. The mountain in itself is a citadel of rock and ice, with steep, angled faces and avalanche-prone ridges guarding its summit. Its immense proportions make it far tougher to climb than Everest. It is at once a supremely magnificent and terrifyingly intimidating mountain.</p>

    <p>For much of the 19th and early 20th century, before it was finally summited in 1936, it was considered to be the third pole â€“ a point of virtual inaccessibility. However, this awe-inspiring creation of nature shelters a device, abhorrent to nature, manufactured by man. Somewhere high on the harrowing slopes of Nanda Devi, buried deep in snow, lies a lost nuclear listening device slowly depleting its plutonium cores. Containing 5kg of plutonium â€“ 1 kg less than the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki â€“ with a predicted lifespan of 900 years, this nuclear trespasser has been forfeited to the mountain forever.</p><p>This is the story behind one of the most audacious acts of espionage in the 20th century.</p>

    <p><strong>Cold War In High Places</strong></p><p>The year was 1965, and the Cold War was reaching its apogee, with America stretching its geopolitical reach to all corners of the world in order to counter the communist influence. Closer to home, the War of â€™62 had left India intensely wary of its neighbour, China. To add fuel to simmering embers, China carried out its first nuclear test in 1964 in Xinjiang, a province that borders the northern tip of India. In this atmosphere of intense mutual suspicion and paranoia, the Pentagon began concocting a plan that would help both India and America keep a closer eye on China, especially with regard to its nuclear programme.</p><p>With satellites that could gather useful photographic intelligence still a few years away, Americaâ€™s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) along with the Indian Intelligence Bureau (IB) planned on placing a powerful listening device at a point of extreme prominence along the Indo-Tibetan border. The site where the device would be placed was key as it would need to have uninterrupted access in order to intercept Chinese radio signals. This meant it would have to be positioned on a mountain that was high as well as close to the Tibetan plateau. With an unparalleled height advantage and an unobstructed view of China from its summit, there was no better choice than Nanda Devi.</p>

    <p>A System for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) generator was designed so that it would power the telemetry functions of the device, a power unit similar to the ones being used in space at the time.</p><p>It was within the SNAP that seven plutonium fuel rods would be stored, made from a compound of Pu-238 and Pu-239. Once activated, the SNAP would constantly be converting radioactive heat energy created by the rods into electricity, which would power the multiple-sensor device as well as its six-foot-long antenna.</p><p>With the technical aspect settled, the question of who would carry and set up all this equipment remained. Only two expeditions had summited the mountain up until then, and more than a few climbers had died. There was no doubt that only the very best mountaineers could be trusted to carry a nuclear payload up one of the most difficult mountains in the world.</p>

    <p>A group of 14 American and four Indian mountaineers was assembled. In totality, they represented the cream of a mountaineering generation. Among the Americans, some of the more famous climbers were Dr Robert Schaller, Tom Frost and Jim McCarthy. The Indian contingent consisted of Captain M S Kohli, Sonam Wangyal, H C S Rawat and G S Bhangu. All four had been members of the successful 1965 Indian Everest Expedition, which had put a record nine climbers on the summit. They were in fact enlisted for this covert expedition just a few days after returning from Everest. Together, the entire group was no less than a mountaineering dream team.</p><p>After having sworn their respective oaths of secrecy, the climbing team was flown to Mount McKinley in Alaska, the highest mountain in North America, to prepare for the arduous expedition ahead. While all of them were without doubt among the most experienced climbers at the time, they were rather new to the more idiosyncratic aspect of the expedition â€“ that of dealing with nuclear material.</p><p>American climber Jim McCarthy was appointed as the designated member of the team who would handle the plutonium rods. Through the summer of 1965, officials from Americaâ€™s Atomic Energy Commission trained McCarthy to load and unload the device without disturbing its deadly occupant. Other team members were briefed on the dangers of their special load as well, and ways to ensure minimum exposure to the deadly radioactive isotopes.</p><p>All climbers were going to be paid $1,000 per month, a hefty amount in the 1960s. While there would be personal gratification from having been of service to their respective nations, they were on no account to tell anyone about the nature of their expedition. The cover for the entire team was that they were a joint Indo-American mountaineering team conducting research for high-altitude flight for the American Air Force. Before departing for India, the covert operation was finally given its official codename: Operation Hat.</p>

    <p><strong>Into the Sanctuary of the Goddess</strong></p><p>In an effort to attract minimal attention, most of the mountaineers were flown into base camp by helicopter in September 1965. However, the climbing equipment, rations, and of course the listening device itself â€” stored inside a solid lead casket â€” were transported in the time-honoured fashion, carried by nearly 150 <em>dotial</em> porters through the Rishi Ganga gorge. The special load did not go unnoticed among the porters, and apart from its unusual weight, many of them alleged to have felt heat emanating from the casket. Mounted on poles, some climbers later noted its uncanny resemblance to the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, in the manner it was transported as well as the supreme power it possessed.</p><p>After having established themselves at the base of the mountain, the mountaineers methodically began making their way up Nanda Devi. Establishing a series of camps along the climbing route, the team was finally positioned to make an attempt on the summit in the middle of October. It was then that catastrophe struck.</p><p>A violent storm hit the mountain and made it impossible to continue. The summit team, along with the device, was encamped just 2,000 feet below their objective. The extreme conditions, however, greatly endangered their position. Keeping in mind the extreme volatility of such storms, Captain Kohli â€” the leader of the climbing team â€” called for an immediate retreat.</p>

    <p>Carrying the 56 kg listening device in deteriorating weather conditions at 23,000 feet was going to be a Herculean task. Prioritising the need for a quick descent to minimise the risk to the lives of his fellow climbers, Kohli decided to ditch the equipment in the high camp. He reasoned that another expedition could always be mounted when weather conditions improved, in order to retrieve the device. On the other hand, the life of a fellow climber was irreplaceable.</p><p>Thus, with all the climbers having safely descended, the expedition came to an end. Being late in the year, the weather window to climb Nanda Devi was now closed. Any new expedition would have to bide their time till the following year. The nuclear device too, abandoned on a high precipice of the mountain, would have to wait.</p><p><strong>Plan B</strong></p><p>With the arrival of spring in 1966, a second expedition was launched to locate the equipment, and most importantly the nuclear device, that had been left the previous autumn. The composition of the climbing team was more or less the same, and soon they were scouring the slopes of Nanda Devi, trying to find their highly valuable and potentially dangerous belongings. But it was all …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></div></div>

It's so elitist.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I have an internal dialogue going all the time trying to convince myself that I don't want my work to be called science. What I do is completely different, more sacred, honest and open and yes sometimes flawed. Sometimes I hide the fact that I have a Ph.D. because I don’t want it to be a symbol of authority or intelligence for myself. It also feels douchey to tell people I have a Ph.D. I want to be judged by my actions, not where I went to school, which can be primarily determined by your parents financial status and education level. I grew up on a farm in rural Indiana. We ate eggs from our chickens and drank dehydrated milk. Up until even high school my family was dirt poor. We had our electricity shut-off and had to take cold showers. When we couldn't afford the phone bill, I walked to 7-11 and used the payphone to call my friends. Violence, evictions, car repossessions — you name it, I’ve lived it. Starting undergrad at SIU I was homeless and lived out of my car and slept on the dorm room floors of people I knew.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was in graduate school, 99% of my peers did not come from a similar background. It was abundantly clear that the practice of science and medicine is only accessible to the upper crust. That’s an issue in itself, but the <b><i>f</i></b><i><b>ucking humongous gigantic bigger problem</b></i> is that cutting-edge medicines are also only available to the societal elite. Time and time again throughout this pandemic, we’ve watched as the wealthy and powerful get all the unapproved drugs to treat their covid, while all of us peasants sit back and do our best not to die without them. The 108 Regeneron antibody cocktails all went to Washington DC.</p><p>That’s why I left academia. Why I quit my job at NASA and started doing science as a biohacker. I want everyone to be able to do science without any gatekeepers. The single greatest impediment to diversity in science is access to knowledge and information that is being held tighter than Ric Flair’s Figure Four Leg Lock.</p><p><b><span>Biohackers are setting knowledge free.</span></b></p><p>In May 2020, an article came out in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/806">science magazine</a> where researchers showed that by using a DNA vaccine that codes for the SARS-COV2 spike protein, they could create antibodies that provide protection from covid-19 in macaque monkeys without harmful side-effects. Getting good monkey data is basically the best pre-human data you can ever hope to get. Most people only have experimental data from mouse tests. When I see a paper like this the gears in my brain begin to spin because there is a good chance the FDA would approve this for human testing.</p><p>So, I decided to test it myself. The project perfectly fit a niche where biohackers have an experimental advantage over academia and industry. With enough knowledge and skill, we could perform quick but data-laden experiments to show whether the same DNA vaccine tested on monkeys would be promising in humans. And instead of taking months or years we could have results in as little as a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>I brought up the idea with David Ishee and Dariia Dantseva, fellow members of the biohacking group the <a href="http://the-cdc.com/" target="_blank">Central Dogma Collective (CDC)</a>. They also thought that based on the data this would be a fucking crazy project. We decided <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNAhY1w2w78rSeNQo_e0dQ2w8mmGEg7Mr">we would live-stream</a> every step so that people could learn how to do advanced biomedical research like this in their own home. If one were to replicate the experiment from scratch, the total individual cost would end up being around $3500, the major costs being $1600 for DNA synthesis and $1200 for the kits to measure coronavirus spike protein antibodies.</p><p>What I really wanted was to show people how to do the science. I didn't really care if it worked or not but I tend to be pessimistic about my own experiments anyway. While testing and creating a successful coronavirus vaccine would send a powerful message to the world, teaching people how to do advanced biomedical research will change it.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the experiment worked. All three of us developed SARS-CoV2 spike protein neutralizing antibodies. I still can't fucking believe it. Not only did we create and test a successful vaccine, we showed that we could get a gene therapy to work (a DNA vaccine changes the DNA in your cells and so is a gene therapy also). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTuRBuy74KlaBzLrd0aTZl852nhPNCWL06aB7wY1JKk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a summary of the experimental details and results</a> if you are interested. We didn't create the vaccine to sell it. We made the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SracILuRbiZt4f7EVH2JBvefaHmsOUsC?usp=sharing" target="_blank">nucleotide sequence and genetic design data open and free</a> so that anyone can easily recreate it. All in a state-of-the-art lab. I'm kidding, my lab is a tiny bedroom in a house in West Oakland, David's is in a shed in rural Mississippi and Dariia's is an old building she converted in Ukraine. If your mind isn't blown, you either already knew about the project or you don't understand what I just told you.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span>If you want to know why I created and tested a coronavirus vaccine on myself, it’s because I am at War.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I know it sounds a bit dramatic but there really is a class war going on. There is a group of people who are actively making choices that cause a disproportionate amount of deaths among those in lower social classes. New gene therapies cost over a million dollars. That’s right. Your life, your child’s life, your mother, your loved one depends on how much money you make. The government and Pharma companies aren’t going to help you when you can’t afford it either. Most of these gene therapies aren't even available outside the US either because most countries with socialized medicine won't pay for them. So don't tell me how your country's healthcare is better.</p><p>Considering that if you are reading this there is a 99% chance you are not part of the top 1%, let me ask you this — why are we letting the wealthy and powerful get away with this?&nbsp;</p><p>Those who have a monopoly on the understanding and use of biotechnology have all the power. If I, if we can teach people how do it themselves then we win back power.</p><p>This is why biohackers are needed in society.&nbsp;</p><p>Now in Dec. 2020, many people are still holed up waiting for a vaccine. The problem is when a vaccine for covid comes around it won't be the 99% that receive it first. Your life isn't worth that much. You're not important or wealthy or powerful. The people who will receive it first are the same people who can sit out a pandemic in the comfort of their home and have their necessities delivered by the working class. They tell everyone else to social distance and wear a mask but won’t do it themselves. Fucking Gavin Newsom.</p><p>Still, we are losing this class war as people continue to fight against their best interest. They believe lying politicians, lying scientists, and are manipulated by the news media. We are told to wait and trust while hundreds of thousands of people in the US die. While small businesses close at an unprecedented rate, but large corporations make billions.</p><p>What the fuck. They are killing us and taken what we own. Why are we still putting up with this?</p><p><b><span>We can take back what belongs to us by creating for ourselves.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>Science and medicine belong to us not them.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Biohack the fucking planet</span></b></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I want the Dunning-Kruger effect to be real. First described in<a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.77.6.1121"> a seminal 1999 paper</a> by David Dunning and Justin Kruger, this effect has been the darling of journalists who want to explain why dumb people don’t know they’re dumb. There’s even<a href="https://youtu.be/BdnH19KsVVc"> video of a fantastic pastiche</a> of Turandot’s famous aria, <i>Nessun dorma,</i> explaining the Dunning-Kruger effect. “They don’t know,” the opera singer belts out at the climax, “that they don’t know.”</p>

<p>I was planning on writing a very short article about the Dunning-Kruger effect and it felt like shooting fish in a barrel. Here’s the effect, how it was discovered, what it means. End of story.</p>

<p>But as I double-checked the academic literature, doubt started to creep in. While trying to understand the criticism that had been leveled at the original study, I fell down a rabbit hole, spoke to a few statistics-minded people, corresponded with Dr. Dunning himself, and tried to understand if our brain really was biased to overstate our competence in activities at which we suck... or if the celebrated effect was just a mirage brought about by the peculiar way in which we can play with numbers.</p>

<p>Have we been overstating our confidence in the Dunning-Kruger effect?</p>

<h5><b>A misunderstood effect</b></h5>

<p>The most important mistake people make about the Dunning-Kruger effect, according to Dr. Dunning, has to do with who falls victim to it. “The effect is about us, not them,” he wrote to me. “The lesson of the effect was always about how we should be humble and cautious about ourselves.” The Dunning-Kruger effect is not about dumb people. It’s mostly about all of us when it comes to things we are not very competent at.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the Dunning-Kruger effect was originally defined as a bias in our thinking. If I am terrible at English grammar and am told to answer a quiz testing my knowledge of English grammar, this bias in my thinking would lead me, according to the theory, to believe I would get a higher score than I actually would. And if I excel at English grammar, the effect dictates I would be likely to slightly underestimate how well I would do. I might predict I would get a 70% score while my actual score would be 90%. But if my actual score was 15% (because I’m terrible at grammar), I might think more highly of myself and predict a score of 60%. This discrepancy is the effect, and it is thought to be due to a specific problem with our brain’s ability to assess its skills.</p>

<p>This is what student participants went through for Dunning and Kruger’s research project in the late 1990s. There were assessments of grammar, of humour, and of logical reasoning. Everyone was asked how well they thought they did and everyone was also graded objectively, and the two were compared.</p>

<p>Since then, many studies have been done that have reported this effect in other domains of knowledge. Dr. Dunning tells me he believes the effect “has more to do with being <i>misinformed</i> rather than uninformed.” If I am asked the boiling point of mercury, it is clear my brain does not hold the answer. But if I am asked what is the capital of Scotland, I may think I know enough to say Glasgow, but it turns out it’s Edinburgh. That’s misinformation and it’s pushing down on that confidence button in my brain.</p>

<p>So case closed, right? On the contrary. In 2016 and 2017, two papers were published in a mathematics journal called <i>Numeracy</i>. In them, the authors argued that the Dunning-Kruger effect was a mirage. And I tend to agree.</p>

<h5><b>The effect is in the noise</b></h5>

<p>The<a href="https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol9/iss1/art4/"> two</a><a href="https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/numeracy/vol10/iss1/art4/"> papers</a>, by Dr. Ed Nuhfer and colleagues, argued that the Dunning-Kruger effect could be replicated by using random data. “We all then believed the [1999] paper was valid,” Dr. Nuhfer told me via email. “The reasoning and argument just made so much sense. We never set out to disprove it; we were even fans of that paper.” In Dr. Nuhfer’s own papers, which used both computer-generated data and results from actual people undergoing a science literacy test, his team disproved the claim that most people that are unskilled are unaware of it (“a small number are: we saw about 5-6% that fit that in our data”) and instead showed that both experts and novices underestimate and overestimate their skills with the same frequency. “It’s just that experts do that over a narrower range,” he wrote to me.</p>

<p>Wrapping my brain around all this took weeks. I recruited a husband-and-wife team, Dr. Patrick E. McKnight (from the Department of Psychology at George Mason University, also on the advisory board of Sense About Science and STATS.org) and Dr. Simone C. McKnight (from Global Systems Technologies, Inc.), to help me understand what was going on. Patrick McKnight not only believed in the existence of the Dunning-Kruger effect: he was teaching it to warn his students to be mindful of what they actually knew versus what they thought they knew. But after replicating Dr. Nuhfer’s findings using a different platform (the statistical computing language R instead of Nuhfer’s Microsoft Excel), he became convinced the effect was just an artefact of how the thing that was being measured was indeed measured.</p>

<p>We had long conversations over this as I kept pushing back. As a skeptic, I am easily enticed by stories of the sort “everything you know about this is wrong.” That’s my bias. To overcome it, I kept playing devil’s advocate with the McKnights to make sure we were not forgetting something. Every time I felt my understanding crystallize, doubt would creep in the next day and my discussion with the McKnights would resume.</p>

<p>I finally reached a point where I was fairly certain the Dunning-Kruger effect had not been shown to be a bias in our thinking but was just an artefact. Here then is the simplest explanation I have for why the effect appears to be real.</p>

<p>For an effect of human psychology to be real, it cannot be rigorously replicated using random noise. If the human brain was predisposed to choose heads when a coin is flipped, you could compare this to random predictions (heads or tails) made by a computer and see the bias. A human would call more heads than the computer would because the computer is making random bets whereas the human is biased toward heads. With the Dunning-Kruger effect, this is not the case. Random data actually mimics the effect really well.</p>

<p>The effect as originally described in 1999 makes use of a very peculiar type of graph. “This graph, to my knowledge, is quite unusual for most areas of science,” Patrick McKnight told me. In the original experiment, students took a test and were asked to guess their score. Therefore, each student had two data points: the score they thought they got (self-assessment) and the score they actually got (performance). In order to visualize these results, Dunning and Kruger separated everybody into quartiles: those who performed in the bottom 25%, those who scored in the top 25%, and the two quartiles in the middle. For each quartile, the average performance score and the average self-assessed score was plotted. This resulted in the famous Dunning-Kruger graph.</p>

<p><img height="627" width="725" src="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/files/oss/figure_1_3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Plotted this way, it looks like those in the bottom 25% thought they did much better than they did, and those in the top 25% underestimated their performance. This observation was thought to be due to the human brain: the unskilled are unaware of it. But if we remove the human brain from the equation, we get this:</p>

<p><img height="451" width="1086" src="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/files/oss/figure_2_1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The above Dunning-Kruger graph was created by Patrick McKnight using computer-generated results for both self-assessment and performance. The numbers were random. There was no bias in the coding that would lead these fictitious students to guess they had done really well when their actual score was very low. And yet we can see that the two lines look eerily similar to those of Dunning and Kruger’s seminal experiment. A<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690100174X"> similar simulation</a> was done by Dr. Phillip Ackerman and colleagues three years after the original Dunning-Kruger paper, and the results were similar.</p>

<p>Measuring someone’s perception of anything, including their own skills, is fraught with difficulties. How well I think I did on my test today could change if the whole thing was done tomorrow, when my mood might differ and my self-confidence may waver. This measurement of self-assessment is thus, to a degree, unreliable. This unreliability--sometimes massive, sometimes not--means that any true psychological effect that does exist will be measured as smaller in the context of an experiment. This is called attenuation due to unreliability. “Scores of books, articles, and chapters highlight the problem with measurement error and attenuated effects,” Patrick McKnight wrote to me. In his simulation with random measurements, the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect actually becomes <i>more</i> visible as the measurement error increases. “We have no instance in the history of scientific discovery,” he continued, “where a finding improves by increasing measurement error. None.”</p>

<h5><b>Breaking the spell</b></h5>

<p>When I plug “Dunning-Kruger effect” into Google News, I get over 8,500 hits from media outlets like <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and the CBC. So many simply endorse the effect as a real bias of the brain, so it’s no wonder that people are not aware of the academic criticism that has existed since the effect was first published. It’s not just Dr. Nuhfer and his <i>Numeracy </i>papers. Other academic critics have pointed the finger, for example, at regression to the mean.</p>

<p>But as Patrick McKnight points out, regression to the mean occurs when the same measure is taken over time and we track its evolution. If I take my temperature every morning and one day spike a fever, that same measure will (hopefully) go down the next day and return to its mean value as my fever abates. That’s regression to the mean. But in the context of the Dunning-Kruger effect, nothing is measured over time, and self-assessment and performance are different measures entirely, so regression to the mean should not apply. The unreliability of the self-assessment …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>
In 2016, Sam Saccone <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/319816">discovered a vulnerability</a> that
allows adversaries to run arbitrary scripts when installing an NPM package of
theirs. As mitigation, NPM co-founder Laurie Voss <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141702881055/package-install-scripts-vulnerability">
suggests</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Option 1</b>: adding <code>--ignore-scripts</code> when running <code><span>npm</span>
install</code>
</li>
<li>
<b>Option 2</b>: permanently adding <code>ignore-scripts=true</code> to <code>.npmrc</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
UI Drafter uses the latter because it avoids having to
remember the flag everytime. But that option disables NPM
<code>"scripts"</code>. Therefore, we end up with two alternatives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Option A</b>: overriding: <code><span>npm</span> run --ignore-scripts=false
<b>test</b></code>
</li>
<li>
<b>Option B</b>: using this shell script or a <a href="#-Makefile">Makefile</a>:
</li>
</ul>
<pre><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>case</span> <span>$1</span> <span>in</span>
  <b>dev</b>)   ./make-dev.js <span>;;</span>
  <b>test</b>)  mocha <span>"src/**/*.test.js"</span><span></span> <span>;;</span>
  <b>lint</b>)  eslint src <span>;;</span>
  <b>slint</b>) stylelint <span>"src/**/*.css"</span><span></span> <span>;;</span>

  <b>prod</b>)  <span>time</span> ./make-production.js <span>;;</span>
  <b>all</b>)   <span>$0</span> <b>test</b> &amp;&amp; <span>$0</span> <b>lint</b> &amp;&amp; <span>$0</span> <b>slint</b> &amp;&amp; <span>$0</span> <b>prod</b> <span>;;</span>

  *)     <span>echo</span> <span>"Invalid task: <span>$1</span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>exit</span> <span>1</span> <span>;;</span>
<span>esac</span>
</pre>
<p>Which can be ran as:</p>
<pre>./<span>make</span> <b>test</b>
</pre>
<p>
If the package is not globally installed, prefix the path. For example:
</p>
<pre><b>lint</b>) <span>node_modules/.bin/</span>eslint src <span>;;</span>
</pre>
<h3>Overriding at installation</h3>
<p>
If you need to install packages that install binary dependencies, or rely
on running an NPM script, override the <code>.npmrc</code>:
</p>
<pre><span>npm</span> install <span>--ignore-scripts=false</span> <i>package-name</i>

Whether it’s finding recipes, figuring out what to wear, finding new beauty tips or literally any other use case imaginable… people are doing it on Pinterest.</p><p>While search engines like Google focus on the bottom of the purchase funnel (ie, once someone knows that they have a need and are actively looking for it) and social networks like Facebook and Instagram focus on the top of the funnel (ie, when customers are passively looking to consume content with no intent), Pinterest is the only place on the internet that lets marketers reach consumer in the consideration phase. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2514c6be4877df4b7599580c5af4d1c3c2f54f86/453eb/img/posts/pinterest-guide/consideration.png" alt="The marketing consideration funnel"></p><p>This creates a big opportunity for businesses to get their products, goods and services in front of potential buyers while they’re deciding what they want to buy, but haven’t made the decision yet. That’s one of the most powerful things about Pinterest- people go there to find ideas, not just to make purchasing decisions. This means that marketers are able to reach consumers before they’ve made up their mind on what they’re looking to do.</p><h2>Pinterest as a source of inbound links</h2><p>While the most clear first-order effect to a strong Pinterest presence is creating a powerful new referral traffic source, there’s also a misunderstood but very powerful second-order effect: creating more inbound links to your website. </p><p>Have you noticed how no matter what you search for, it seems that you almost always see Pinterest results on the first page of Google? Pinterest’s core growth strategy has been about getting excellent at SEO, or search engine optimization. Practically speaking this means that the company has spent a lot of effort creating millions of high quality landing pages with the explicit purpose of being indexed by Google. Each of these landing pages shows dozens of Pins, and each contains a link to that Pin’s page on Pinterest. </p><p>As your content becomes more popular, it will begin showing up on more of Pinterest’s SEO pages, which means that it will be more readily indexed by Google. Since Google gives Pinterest’s domain a high authority and quality score, this means that over time you will start to accumulate some of this authority if your Pins are shown in prominent places. So, getting good at Pinterest doesn’t just help improve your Pinterest referral traffic, it can also improve your traffic from places like Google! </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bbc3082cbd708936207fcc8fed30415b5077ee03/32add/img/posts/pinterest-guide/pinterest-results.png" alt="Example of Pinterest landing pages"></p><h2>Pinterest is a search engine</h2><p>The most important thing to understand about Pinterest is that at its core it’s a search engine, not a social network.  People don’t use Pinterest to “follow” specific brands but rather to follow interests and search for ideas. A “Pin” is simply a visual bookmark to a webpage, and under the hood Pinterest’s technology stack is focused on figuring out what interests a Pin is about, and which users are interested in which interests. Content on Pinterest isn’t temporal like other social networks, but evergreen like on Google.</p><h2>Help Pinterest understand your content</h2><p>This means that the most important thing to get right for Pinterest marketing is helping Pinterest understand what interests your Pins are about. This means that the key underlying concept for Pinterest marketing is to create Pins for all of your web content, and then make sure that Pinterest has a clear understanding of what interests they align to. </p><p>Once Pinterest understands what a given Pin is about, it can start showing it to users to see how they interact with it. If they engage with it (ie, Save it to one of their boards or Click on it to see the underlying content), Pinterest uses this as a positive sign that this is quality content and will begin showing it to more people. </p><p>As such, one of the most important things to get right is having a clear strategy for how to communicate to Pinterest what your Pins are about and getting engagement signals on the Pins early. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/db6e047a9650880cd7f0be4c4718c0791790c2e0/18ef8/img/posts/pinterest-guide/pinterest-interests.png" alt="Example of Pinterest interests"></p><h2>Choose your Interests</h2><p>The most critical thing to get right in your Pinterest marketing plan is determining what Interests are most important to your business. There are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HxL-0Z3p2fgxis9YBP2HWC3tvPrs1hAuHDRtH-NJTIM/edit#gid=118370875">over 10,000 interests on Pinterest today</a>, ranging from highly broad to highly specific. Start by brainstorming what interests your target audience has today, as well as what interests your content is actually about. Look for the overlap of these two sets and choose the 10-15 that have the most promise to focus in on first. </p><h2>Create your Boards</h2><p>Once you’ve chosen the interests that you want to focus on, the next step is to decide on the architecture of your Pinterest for Business account. Pinterest accounts for users and businesses alike are defined by the boards that they create and post Pins to. You can think of a board as a folder of visual bookmarks that are public by default. When someone looks at your Pinterest account, the fastest way that they will understand what you’re about is by the names of the boards that you create. </p><p>Start by creating boards whose names are the same as the 10-15 interests you chose to focus on. It’s OK if they have more words in them as well, but make sure that the Interest name itself is very prominent. Make sure that each board has a very specific description that explains the core ideas that you’ll be pinning to the board.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dadf2e2890dde22bbff64a7ded8e0dcf6b592fe9/31afa/img/posts/pinterest-guide/boards.png" alt="Example of Pinterest boards"></p><p>Next, you need to decide what content to start posting onto these boards. </p><h2>Pinning existing content</h2><p>There are only two kinds of Pins on Pinterest: Pins from your own website, and Pins from other people’s websites. Both are equally important to a strong Pinterest strategy. The first thing you should do is to fill your boards with Pins that are already on Pinterest and were created by other people. Spend some time saving 20-30 Pins to each of your boards. As you do this, Pinterest will also begin recommending new Pins in your homefeed that are related to what you’ve been Pinning. </p><p>The reason you’re seeing the Pins that Pinterest is recommending to you is because Pinterest already knows a lot about them and has a high confidence that users like you will find them interesting. When you save them to your boards, you’re giving Pinterest even more signal about what your board is about. This is extremely important, because Pinterest learns a lot about new Pins based on the other Pins that it shows up on boards with. </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a3580f834d291668bd22cae46f7854ddb0106853/de8da/img/posts/pinterest-guide/existing-pin.png" alt="Example of Pinterest pins"></p><p>Each week you should also continue to save new, existing content to your boards to keep giving Pinterest more signal and context for what your Pins are about. </p><h2>Pinning your own content</h2><p>Once you create a good base of existing Pins on your boards, you can start to plan your strategy for getting your own original content into Pinterest. First, go through all of your existing website content and map out what content would be relevant for the Pinterest audience. Generally speaking, the best content will be things like blog posts or eCommerce product landing pages. You should skip things like your homepage, about page, contact us page or other informational pages that don’t provide highly specific and useful content about a specific concept. </p><p>On social networks, it’s important that you have a steady pace of posting content into your feed so that you stay top of mind and also don’t inundate followers by posting 100 things at once. Pinterest is much more like Google, however, where you want them to know about your content upfront and all at once. </p><p>You should post all of your existing, relevant content to Pinterest upfront and then consistently add new content as it’s published online. Save it to the most relevant board to give Pinterest a clear understanding of what your content’s about. You can also post it to more than one board if it’s relevant to multiple categories. </p><p>The Pins that perform best on Pinterest have been created specifically for Pinterest following their <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en-gb/content/creative-best-practices/">creative best practices</a>. Practically speaking this means that each Pin will require some editing work within a graphics editor tool. Generally speaking, each Pin can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to create by hand if using a tool like Photoshop, Canva or Adobe Spark. This can be quite burdensome, especially if you’re trying to create dozens or hundreds of Pins for your site. </p><p><a href="https://www.aesthetic.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=pinterest-guide">Aesthetic’s software</a> is able to generate on-brand Pinterest Pins from a company’s website automatically. Simply enter a URL, and our app will create dozens of variations of graphics to promote that webpage, including several that follow Pinterest’s best practices guide. We’ve seen our users cut down the time it takes to create a Pin by 95% using our tool. </p><p>Once you’ve created your Pin graphics, you can upload them into the Pinterest system. Add the URL for each Pin along with a detailed description that touches upon what the Pins about and ideally mentions the specific interests that it’s related to. Post these to the right boards, and you’re off to the races! </p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4ab1dd02738de6695f0118fd169a78c4e10d21bb/09e8b/img/posts/pinterest-guide/aesthetic-pins.png" alt="Example of Pinterest pins made with Aesthetic"></p><p>Once you’ve uploaded your content to Pinterest, you will see the impressions slowly start to trickle in as the system understands more about what your content’s about. Generally speaking it can take months for new content on Pinterest to get enough exposure for Pinterest to determine whether it’s sufficiently interesting enough for it to be promoted more widely within the system.</p><p>Another option to fast track the distribution of your Pins is to run small budget ads for your own Pins, targeting the Interests that they’re related …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

		<p>In my quest to write a fast IPv4+6 parser, I wrote a
slow-but-I-think-correct parser, to use as a base of comparison. In
doing so, I discovered more cursed IP address representations that I
was previously unaware of. Let’s explore together!</p>

<p>We start out simple, with IPv4 and IPv6 in what I’ll call their
“canonical form”: <code>192.168.0.1</code> and <code>1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8</code>. Various specs
call these “dotted quad” (more specifically, “dotted decimal”),
dot-separated fields each representing 1 byte; and “colon-hex”,
colon-separated fields each representing 2 bytes.</p>

<p>The first bits of complexity come from IPv6. In canonical form, common
addresses would end up with long runs of zeros in the middle. So, <code>::</code>
allows you to elide 1 or more 16-bit blocks of zeros: <code>1:2::3:4</code> means
<code>1:2:0:0:0:0:3:4</code></p>

<p>Next up, for cursed historical reasons, IPv6 permits you to write the
final 32 bits of the address in dotted quad form. Effectively, you can
splat an IPv4 address onto the end of IPv6 addresses!
<code>1:2:3:4:5:6:77.77.88.88</code> means <code>1:2:3:4:5:6:4d4d:5858</code>.</p>

<p>And of course, you can combine the two! <code>fe80::1.2.3.4</code> means <code>fe80:0:0:0:0:0:102:304</code></p>

<p>The existence of <code>::</code> introduces an annoying edge case in parsing: the
<code>::</code> can be at the start or end of the address, and the “empty” side
of the address is not one of the 16-bit fields. <code>::1</code> means
<code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</code>, <code>1::</code> means <code>1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0</code>, and <code>::</code> means
<code>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0</code>. This is a natural consequence of the <code>::</code> rule, but
it makes the parser slightly more annoying to write.</p>

<p>One final rule for IPv6: technically, each colon-hex field is 4 hex
digits, but you can elide leading zeros, as I’ve been doing so
far. Fully canonically, <code>::</code> is
<code>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000</code>. My apologies to trypophobic
readers.</p>

<p>That’s it for IPv6, mostly. Now, on to IPv4!</p>

<p>Fun fact, the textual representation of IPv4 was never standardized in
any document before IPv6 needed a grammar for its weirdo “trailing
dotted quad” notation. So, it’s a de-facto standard that boils down to
mostly “what did 4.2BSD understand?”, and “what did other OSes keep
when they copied 4.2BSD?”</p>

<p>And hoo boy, strap yourselves in, because 4.2BSD sure had some whacky
opinions! Let’s use <code>192.168.140.255</code> as an example. That’s an IPv4
address that people would look at and go “yes, that sure is an IPv4
address.” How else can we write that exact same address?</p>

<p>This is the same IP address: <code>3232271615</code>. You get that by
interpreting the 4 bytes of the IP address as a big-endian unsigned
32-bit integer, and print that. This leads to a classic parlor trick:
if you try to visit <a href="http://192.168.140.255/">http://3232271615</a> , Chrome will load
<a href="http://192.168.140.255/">http://192.168.140.255</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, but that’s sort-of sensible, right? An IPv4 address is 4 bytes,
so printing it as a single number is a bit human-unfriendly, but
broadly plausible, right?</p>

<p>How about <code>0300.0250.0214.0377</code> ? That’s still the same
address. Dotted quad, except each field is written out in octal.</p>

<p>And if octal is supported, you might be wondering about hex. And you’d
be right! <code>192.168.140.255</code> is also <code>0xc0.0xa8.0x8c.0xff</code>, according
to 4.2BSD.</p>

<p>Now, remember before we had CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) ?
IPv4 addresses were Class A, Class B or Class C. It was a weird time.</p>

<p>And that weird time made it into IP addresses! The familiar
<code>192.168.140.255</code> notation is technically the “Class C” notation. You
can also write that address in “class B” notation as <code>192.168.36095</code>,
or in “Class A” notation as <code>192.11046143</code>. What we’re doing is
coalescing the final bytes of the address into either a 16-bit or a
24-bit integer field.</p>

<p>This, by the way, is why utilities like <code>ping</code> will accept weird
looking addresses like <code>127.1</code> for <code>127.0.0.1</code>. Unlike IPv6, it’s not
doing some kind of “missing fields are zero” expansion. <code>127.1</code> is the
Class A notation for “host 1 of network 127”, where the 1 is a 24-bit
number.</p>

<p>And finally, we come to one last bit of unspecified behavior: do IPv4
addresses permit an unlimited number of leading zeros in each quad? Or
is there a maximum of 3 digits? <code>001.002.003.004</code> is universally
recognized as valid. What about
<code>0000000001.0000000002.0000000003.000000004</code>?</p>

<p>You might also be wondering if either of these numbers should be read
in as octal, since we said earlier that a leading zero might be
interpreted as octal. It depends! There are implementations that do
both, but <em>most</em> modern implementations have abandoned the octal and
hex notation, and treat leading 0s as decimal.</p>

<p>The leading zero debate also infects IPv6, to some extent. Is
<code>000001::00001.00002.00003.00004</code> is a valid IPv6 address (“common”
form <code>1::1.2.3.4</code>, or <code>1::102:304</code>)? Most modern parsers seem to allow
an unlimited amount of leading zeros in their representations,
probably because they’re leaning on some “parse integer” library that
implements that behavior.</p>

<p>And so, we reach the bitter end. If you want to <em>truly</em> parse IP
addresses, this is the bullshit you have to put up with.</p>

<p>Currently, my slow reference parser jettisons a lot of old baggage,
and sticks to what I think is a sensible subset of these
possibilities. It understands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classic v4 dotted decimal, with any number of leading zeros.</li>
<li>It does not process Class A/B notation, or hex or octal notation.</li>
<li>It does not process the “uint32 to the knee” representation.</li>
<li>For IPv6, it understands canonical colon-hex form, as well as ::
and trailing-IPv4 style (where the trailing IPv4 follows the same
rules as the previous tweet). Each field is allowed any number of
leading zeros.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m on the fence about that last one, the “IPv6 with an embedded
dotted decimal” form. My reference parser (Go’s <code>net.ParseIP</code>)
understands it, but it’s not really that useful any more in the real
world. At the dawn of IPv6, the idea was that you could upgrade an
address to IPv6 by prepending a pair of colons, as in <code>::1.2.3.4</code>, but
modern transition mechanisms no longer offer anything as clear-cut as
this, so the notation doesn’t really show up in the wild.</p>

	<p>
Numbers. Numbers are easy. All you need to know to sort them out is that
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
if 1 ≤ 2 and 2 ≤ 3 then 1 ≤ 3;
	</li>
	<li>
either 4 ≤ 5 or 5 ≤ 4...
	</li>
	<li>
...or both, but if 6 ≤ 6 and 6 ≤ 6 then 6 = 6.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
Oh, shit! I forgot to put a smart face on. Let's start over.
	</p>
	<p>
A <b><span id="index_total_order">total order</span></b>, also known as <b><span id="index_linear_order">linear order</span></b> is a relation “≤” on a set <span>S</span>. For <span>a, b, c ∈ S</span>, the three properties hold.
	</p>
	<p>
The first one is called <b><span id="index_transitivity">transitivity</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⇒ a ≤ c.
	</p>
	<p>
The second one is <b><span id="index_connexity">connexity</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a
	</p>
	<p>
And the third one is <b><span id="index_antisymmetry">antisymmetry</span></b>.
	</p>
	<p>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a ⇒ a = b
	</p>
	<p>
With rules established for <span>≤</span>, we can also tell either <span>a &lt; b</span> or <span>a &gt; b</span> or <span>a = b</span> for every <span>a</span> and <span>b</span>.
	</p>
	
	
<br>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Predicate</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr><td>a = b</td>		<td id="e"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &lt; b</td>	<td id="l"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &gt; b</td>	<td id="g"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≠ b</td>	<td id="ne"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≤ b</td>	<td id="le"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≥ b</td>	<td id="ge"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
	<p>
Real numbers are comparable. That implies that you can sort them. Of course, not only numbers are comparable. Names are comparable and sortable in alphabetical order. Skyscrapers are comparable and sortable by height. A lot of things are comparable and sortable.
	</p>
	<p>
But a few things aren't. Like the <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/yet_another_alternative_to_floating_point_numbers.html">intervals, we use to represent numbers with errors</a>. We use them when we don't know the exact number <span>x</span> but we know its error <span>ε</span> and therefore have all the reasons to believe that it's jammed somewhere between <span>x<sub>1</sub></span> and <span>x<sub>2</sub></span> where
	</p>
	<p>
x<sub>1</sub> = x − ε
<br>
x<sub>2</sub> = x + ε
	</p>
	<p>
These intervals are helpful when we want to measure a computational error of some calculation or to see if some algorithm is stable enough. They aren't comparable or truly sortable though.
	</p>
	<p>
Consider two overlapping intervals. Let's say, <span>[3, 6]</span> and <span>[5, 8]</span>. We know that the fist interval actually means a number between  <span>3</span> and  <span>6</span>. The second — another number between <span>5</span> and <span>8</span>. Intuitively, the latter should be greater than the former. But what if it is  <span>5</span> and the former is  <span>6</span>? Then it's obviously less. There is a chance they are even equal. 
	</p>
	<p>
So there is some kind of order, for instance, <span>[6, 8]</span> is definitely greater than  <span>[3, 5]</span>. But this order doesn't hold for every possible pair of intervals.
	</p>
	<p>
This makes things unpleasant. For the very least, we can't now use binary logic since all the comparisons now return three states. E. g. <span>a ≤ b</span> can now be <span>true</span>, <span>false</span> or <span>none of the above</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
Consequently, this means the conventional <span>if... else</span> statement now has to be redesigned. And all the algorithms that use it.
	</p>
	<p>
We wouldn't have to give up binary logic completely if we agree to “split” the semantics of the predicates into two. For every predicate on the two intervals, we can still say whether the numbers they represent definitely suffice the predicate, or whether they possibly do so.
	</p>
	<p>
For instance, <span>[3, 5]</span> is definitely less than <span>[6, 8]</span>, and <span>[3, 6]</span> is possibly less than <span>[5, 8]</span>. The most unpleasant case for us is when intervals overlap. Everything is indefinite, and everything is possible then.
	</p>
<br>
	
	
<br>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Predicate</th><th>Deffinitely</th><th>Possibly</th></tr>
<tr><td>a = b</td>		<td id="de"></td>		<td id="pe"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &lt; b</td>	<td id="dl"></td>		<td id="pl"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a &gt; b</td>	<td id="dg"></td>		<td id="pg"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≠ b</td>	<td id="dne"></td>	<td id="pne"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≤ b</td>	<td id="dle"></td>	<td id="ple"></td></tr>
<tr><td>a ≥ b</td>	<td id="dge"></td>	<td id="pge"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

	<p>
Still, every <span>if... else</span> works. Within its semantics that is. However, the algebra behind the logic isn't yet Boolean. Now <span>¬ (a &lt; b) ≢ a ≥ b</span>. Computational algorithms may be technically built using the same building blocks as if the intervals were numbers but that's it.
	</p>

	<p>
Speaking of building stuff. Let's talk about programming. Programming non-Boolean interval logic in C++ or Python is fairly easy. You have to reimplement every predicate for the interval type — and you're golden!
	</p>
	<pre id="code_1">struct Interval {
    Number lb; // lower bound
    Number ub; // upper bound

bool operator!=(const Interval&amp; l, const Interval&amp; r){
    return r &lt; l || l &lt; r;
}</pre>
	<p>
Nobody cares about the relationship between predicates being Boolean-ish. They are all just some arbitrary functions so with them, you can easily define either the “definite” logic or the “possible” one. You can have both if you define them for different but interchangeable types. It's all a little verbose but doable.
	</p>
	<p>
It gets a little bit more tricky in Rust which relies on the notion of order pretty much.
	</p>
	<p>
The comparison operators for a custom type are usually introduced using an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html">std::cmp::Ord</a> trait. It requires that:
	</p>
	<p>
∀ a, b: (a &lt; b) ⊕ (a = b) ⊕ (a &gt; b)
<br>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⇒ a ≤ c.
	</p>
	<p>
The first reads as for every <span>a</span> and <span>b</span>, one and only one is true: either <span>(a &lt; b)</span> or <span>(a = b)</span> or <span>(a &gt; b)</span>. This doesn't work for us. When intervals intersect, in “definite” logic none of the predicates are true. And in the “possible” logic, they all are.
	</p>
	<p>
Luckily, there is another more relaxed trait that represents not total order, but <span id="index_partial_order">partial order</span>: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html">std::cmp::PartialOrd</a>. Which only requires <b><span id="index_asymmetry">asymmetry</span></b> (not even antisymmetry) and transitivity (we've seen it before):
	</p>
	<p>
a &lt; b ⇒ ¬(a &gt; b)
<br>
a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c ⇒ a ≤ c.
	</p>
	<p>
Аnd for the “definite” logic, this works.
	</p>
	<pre id="code_2">impl std::cmp::PartialEq for RB32{
    // the same as operator == in C++ or __eq__(self, other) in Python
    fn eq(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool {
        self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; self.ub == other.ub
    }
}

impl std::cmp::PartialOrd for RB32{
    // this is usually enough to replace all the rest
    fn partial_cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Option&lt;std::cmp::Ordering&gt; {
        if self.ub &lt; other.lb {
            Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Less)
        } else if self.lb &gt; other.ub {
            Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Greater)
        } else if self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; self.ub == other.ub {
            Some(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal)
        } else {
            None // this is what differentiates Ord and PartialOrd
        }
    }

    // but since in out logic, (a &lt; b) ∨ (a = b) ≢ a ≤ b,
    // we have to define ≤ and ≥ explicitly.
    fn le(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool {
        (self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; self.lb == self.ub) ||
        (self.ub == other.ub &amp;&amp; other.lb == other.ub)
    }
    fn ge(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool {
        (self.ub == other.ub &amp;&amp; self.lb == self.ub) ||
        (self.lb == other.lb &amp;&amp; other.lb == other.ub)
    }
}</pre>

	<p>
The code is less verbose than in C++ or Python, and it would have been even less so if we were relying on Boolean algebra. With it, you don't even have to write <span>le</span> or <span>ge</span> methods explicitly, <span>cmp</span> is enough. With Boolean algebra, Rust can deduce the rest for you.
	</p>
	<p>
Ok, but that was the “definite” logic. But what about the “possible”?
	</p>
	<p>
I'm afraid, for this particular task, Rust comes short. In the “possible” interval logic, the intersecting intervals may be <span>a &lt; b</span>, and <span>a = b</span>, and <span>a &gt; b</span>, all at the same time. Every predicate is true since everything is possible. You can't program that with Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html">Ordering</a>. However, this is not a flaw, this is a design choice.
	</p>
	<p>
Non-Boolean logics are rare, and relations more general than partial order are almost never useful. If you really really want this kind of logic, you can still implement it using functions and not operators. At the same time, you can expect that if a class implements the <span>std::cmp::Ord</span> trait, then all the sorting algorithms will work with it correctly. While in C++, a sorting algorithm will run on anything with the <span>operator&lt;</span> reloaded with no correctness guaranteed or even pinky-promised.
	</p>
	<h2>
Conclusion
	</h2>
	<p>
Non-Boolean logics are rare but not extinct. Interval logic is one example. Sometimes, you can implement a logic you want within total order or partial order but sometimes even that isn't enough and you need an even more general relation. With operator overloading, you have the freedom to go there but you also have less assurance when working within the total order.
	</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="What’s The Best Non-Smart TV Sold Today?"><div itemprop="text">
<p>With the industry-wide transition to smart TVs many of us have felt like there is no option but to get one. And the walls are closing in — it seems like almost every TV sold today is a smart one, which means a lack of control of what’s happening on our device, the possibility of the company deciding one day to show us ads (as Samsung as done), and the certainty that our viewing and usage data is being sent off to all sorts of third parties. </p>



<p>The solution? Buy a dumb TV!</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_A_Dumb_TV">What Is A Dumb TV?</span></h2>



<p>The alternative to Smart TVs are, of course, non-smart TVs or, as people have taken to calling them, dumb TVs. These are televisions without an internet connection, without built-in HBO Max or Disney, without Amazon Alexa, and lacking apps of any kind. A dumb TV is the television equivalent of a flip phone. </p>



<p>Just because your TV is dumb doesn’t mean you can’t use Roku or Apple TV, etc. In this case you are simply opting to plug those devices into your TV via HDMI rather than having them built in. In almost all cases the plugged in device is better than having the software version built into your TV, so you are making your TV be smart instead of being forced to have one. </p>



<h2><span id="Why_Not_Buy_An_Old_TV">Why Not Buy An Old TV?</span></h2>



<p>You can definitely buy an old TV to solve this problem instead of hunting around for an increasingly rare non-smart in 2021. Televisions age pretty well, so as long as you can find something relatively high quality and made in the last 8 (or so) years you are good to go. </p>



<p>You’ll mainly need to ensure that your older model is in good physical condition, has enough HDMI ports to suit a current user, has no burn-in or wear issues, has a working remote, doesn’t have cracked or wrecked speakers, and that the color hasn’t gone crazy over time. You’ll also want to make sure your TV is an LED TV, so it’s power efficient and looks great, instead of using an outdated technology (like plasma). </p>



<p>For example, I have a Samsung dumb TV from 2012 (or so) that works perfectly well, has sufficient volume, and completely gets the job done. It was a good TV when I bought it, and it’s a great TV now, because it doesn’t have any of the features that I don’t want — and can’t avoid — today. </p>



<h2><span id="Just_Dont_Connect_It_To_the_Internet">Just Don’t Connect It To the Internet</span></h2>



<p>A smart TV can’ the smart without an internet connection so one thing you can do to get a dumb TV is to simply not connect it to your WiFi network. Your TV will will work since it’s connect through coax but the rest of the data cannot flow because the television doesn’t have an internet connection!</p>



<p>You can then go ahead and add a Nvidia Shield or Apple TV and connect that to the internet. This way the auxiliary devices will have internet connection <em>while you are using them</em>, but the TV itself (the hypervisor in this scenario) stays blissfully unaware of that internet connection. </p>



<p>Note, there have been scattered reports of some TVs, including those from Samsung, simply searching for open WiFi signals and attempting to connect to them, but this is an extreme and user-hostile example that hopefully won’t be repeated (assuming its true in the first place).</p>



<p>Some smart TV will force you to connect them to the internet for firmware updates and will resort to frequent nagging to get you to do this, but very few will force you to do it or not work entirely without the connection (yet). </p>



<h2><span id="Best_Dumb_TVs">Best Dumb TVs</span></h2>



<p>Here are some intelligent picks in non-smart TVs. </p>

At this point many manufacturers will take measures like building ads into the core technology of their software so blocking ads will break other features. Also many manufacturers will hardcode their DNS to their preferred vendor, not allowing you to override their option with your PiHole. </p></li></ol></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]>

<section>
<div>
<p>As one of the poster childs for bad programming languages, PHP has always been in the top 5 “worst programming languages”; however, as of 2021, is that still a thing?</p>

<p>PHP was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> in 1994. Lerdorf developed a bunch of scripts to track the visits to his online resume, and named them as “Personal Home Page Tools”, which then evolved into being called as “PHP Tools”. He kept adding more tools to this suite, and at some point pulled off a rewrite of the tools, including added functionality for database interactions and more, turning it into a more complete framework. From that point on, the tools have evolved into a more complex primitives and kept gaining more users after it is <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/c/PyJ25gZ6z7A/m/M9FkTUVDfcwJ?pli=1">open-sourced</a> in 1995. A more detailed history of the language can be found in <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php">the official PHP website</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, the latest version of the PHP language is 8.0.</p>

<p>The language has had a target on its back for years now, and people are rightfully calling out the bad taste they have with the language, especially with the older versions. The language has been developed with the intention of being a templating language, rather than being a full-blown programming language; therefore, there are some downsides with it that made it especially harder to maintain larger apps.</p>
<h2 id="weak-typing">Weak Typing</h2>
<p>One part of the language that I personally dislike is the weak typing that allows combining different types and casts them implicitly. Consider the following example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3"</span><span>;</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"1"</span> <span>+</span> <span>"3"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The results of all these operations are <code>4</code>, which means the language casts the numbers in the string to integers in the context of the addition operator. This might be desirable in some cases or it might save a few lines of code here and there, but the larger a project gets, the harder it becomes to maintain it.</p>
<p>The more recent versions of the language have started introducing warnings for these kinds of weird and invalid operations, which means that they are either deprecated or already on their way to be deprecated.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-namespaces">Lack of Namespaces</h2>
<p>The support for namespaces has been introduced in PHP by the version 5.3, which means that all the older projects have had to build their own kind of namespacing, which usually relied on adding namespaces to the class and method names, requiring absurdly long names everywhere. For projects that were developed with the prior versions, it is very common to see classes named like <code>Payments_Provider_ProcessorProvider_SomeExternalServiceProvider</code> whereas it could have been named like <code>SomeExternalServiceProvider</code> simply. This results in very verbose code in most of the cases, and it makes it harder to read and skim through the code.</p>
<p>The more recent versions of the language doesn’t have this problem though.</p>
<h2 id="inconsistent-standard-library-functions">Inconsistent Standard Library Functions</h2>
<p>I am not saying the standard library of the language is bad, but one could argue that it could have been better. To be fair, the language has been improving quite a lot, but the early versions of the standard library, which is already being used, referenced and supported due to backwards compatibility results, were lacking consistency. Although a small disturbance, this meant that many of the standard library functions had different naming conventions, argument names and ordering, making it harder to assume the defaults and the behavior.</p>
<p>Here are some naming inconsistencies with the string methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php"><code>strpos(string $haystack, string $needle, int $offset = 0): int|false</code></a>: Find the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-split.php"><code>str_split(string $string, int $length = 1): array</code></a>: Convert a string to an array.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php"><code> explode(string $separator, string $string, int $limit = PHP_INT_MAX): array</code></a>: Split a string by a string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three different functions, one with a <code>str</code> prefix, another with <code>str_</code> prefix, and the third with no prefix. The <code>$string</code> argument is the first argument for <code>str_split</code>, but the second one for the <code>explode</code> one. You can check out all the string methods <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.strings.php">in the documentation</a>, and each of these patterns have many functions following similar patterns, meaning that there is not much of a consistency with these functions.</p>
<h2 id="superglobals">Superglobals</h2>
<p>More of personal choice, but I hate the use of the globals, and consequently <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php">superglobals</a>. Especially if you run into some home-baked old projects, it is highly likely that you’ll run into the famous variables like <code>$_SERVER</code> or <code>$_REQUEST</code>. Don’t get me wrong, these are very helpful sometimes and will need to be used eventually; however, encapsulating these into reusable classes should be done as one of the first steps in order to be able to use these values safely. If not, touching these values or doing any change in a slightly larger project gets a very complicated experience where there are many hidden dependencies on these values.</p>

<p>Even though it had left a bad taste in many people’s mouth, the language itself has been improving quite a lot in the last few years. With the release of PHP 7, the language has gone through a modernization process where many nice features were introduced to the language basics, the speed was improved, and the usability has increased quite a lot.</p>
<h2 id="type-hints">Type-hints</h2>
<p>This is one of my favorite ways of modernizing legacy PHP code: using non-enforced type-hints that handle type casting as well as providing documentation for the code. Check out the following simple function:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>isValueSomething</span><span>(</span><span>$value</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you include the type hints, it becomes something like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>isValueSomething</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> <span>$value</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Just by looking at the signature, we are able to tell it expects a string value, and it will return a boolean result. One could claim that the naming convention could have been useful here as well, but these type-hints reassure that the values will be of those types, as well as giving the IDE a lot of power for auto-complete and static analysis with warnings and stuff.</p>
<p>Since PHP 7.4, PHP allows defining typed properties for classes as well:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>;</span> 

    <span>public</span> <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This means your <code>Person</code> objects will have string first and last names, an integer age, and a nullable string value for the job. Being able to define this becomes very useful the more classes you have.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-improvements">Syntax Improvements</h2>
<p>PHP now has bunch of syntactical improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php">Arrow functions</a>: <code>fn ($x, $y) =&gt; $x + $y;</code></li>
<li>Null coalescing operator: <code>$value = $array['key'] ?? 'default value';</code></li>
<li>Null coalescing assignment: <code>return $cache['key'] ??= computeSomeValue('key')</code>;</li>
<li>Array spreading: <code>$first = ['a', 'b']; $second = ['c', 'd']; $final = [...$first, ...$second];</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.named-arguments">Named arguments</a>: <code>array_fill(start_index: 0, num: 100, value: 50);</code></li>
<li>Numeric literal separator: <code>299_792_458</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these syntactical improvements, it also includes stuff for more complex improvements.</p>
<h3 id="constructor-promotion"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php#language.oop5.decon.constructor.promotion">Constructor Promotion</a></h3>
<p>Look at the following Person class:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>;</span>

    <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>;</span> 

    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span><span>(</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>,</span>
        <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span>
    <span>){</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>firstName</span> <span>=</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>lastName</span> <span>=</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>$age</span><span>;</span>
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>job</span> <span>=</span> <span>$job</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Instead of having this unnecessarily verbose code, PHP 8 supports writing the following code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span><span>(</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$firstName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>string</span> <span>$lastName</span><span>,</span>
        <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> <span>$age</span><span>,</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>?</span><span>string</span> <span>$job</span>
    <span>){}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="nullsafe-operator"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php#language.oop5.basic.nullsafe">Nullsafe Operator</a></h3>
<p>This is something that had existed in some other languages like Javascript but PHP didn’t have the support for this. Take a look at the following code which I grabbed from the PHP docs:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>is_null</span><span>(</span><span>$repository</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>$user</span> <span>=</span> <span>$repository</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>is_null</span><span>(</span><span>$user</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>$user</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This was how the logic would be written with the older PHP versions with respect to null-checks. The new nullsafe operator allows converting this to simply:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$result</span> <span>=</span> <span>$repository</span><span>?-&gt;</span><span>getUser</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span><span>?-&gt;</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Isn’t it gorgeous?</p>
<h3 id="union-types"><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php#language.types.declarations.union">Union Types</a></h3>
<p>Even though this is a less favorite feature of mine, it is still valuable for the cases where there is already multiple possible types and we don’t type-hint anything. Union types simply allow defining multiple types for a value as options. Thanks to the union types, the following code becomes valid:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>doSomething</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>|</span><span>string</span> <span>$value</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>|</span><span>array</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Usually having multiple return types indicate an opportunity for improvement, but previous versions of PHP didn’t allow us to define types for cases like these at all, so having this is still an improvement.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>I don’t have any hard numbers compared to other languages, but PHP has improved significantly over time compared to the previous versions. In addition to the jump PHP 7 brought over PHP 5.6, all the consecutive releases have brought several percent-point improvements at least and the trend is continuing. Some benchmarks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=php-74-benchmarks&amp;num=2">done by Phoronix</a> show that the latest PHP 8 is more than 3x faster than PHP 5.6. There are more detailed tests in the original posts, make sure to give it a look.</p>
<p><img src="https://saasstarterkit.app/blog/assets/images/posts/is-php-still-relevant/php-benchmark-1.png" alt="PHP Benchmark 1"></p>
<p>In addition to those benchmarks, Kinsta has also conducted some real-world benchmarks with tools like Wordpress, <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/#">full article here</a>. Here’s the result for Wordpress 5.3:</p>
<p><img src="https://saasstarterkit.app/blog/assets/images/posts/is-php-still-relevant/php-benchmark-2.png" alt="PHP Benchmark 2"></p>
<p>The numeric results they have shared are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 5.6 benchmark: <code>97.71 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.0 benchmark results: <code>256.81 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.1 benchmark results: <code>256.99 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.2 benchmark results: <code>273.07 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.3 benchmark results: <code>305.59 req/sec</code></li>
<li>WordPress 5.3 PHP 7.4 benchmark results: <code>313.42 req/sec</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These benchmarks do not include PHP 8 yet, but the 7.4 is capable of handling 3x requests of 5.6, which is a pretty significant improvement.</p>

<p>Overall, PHP has improved quite a lot over …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

			</div>
			<p>My working title for this blog post was “Why I’ll Never Fly With easyJet Again”, but that was far too clickbaity. Also it’s probably worth prefixing this post with two things. The first being the caveat that whether or not i ever fly with easyJet again is immaterial to their business, given that the model of budget airlines is one of opportunistic sales. Their loyalty programmes are minimal to non-existent<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (although that may change in the near future<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>) because the nature of their passengers is not one of loyalty. When you’re looking for a short haul cheap flight you’re unlikely to be attracted to schemes that only benefit you after years, or hundreds of thousands of air miles, worth of loyalty.</p>

<p>The reality of the budget airlines is they don’t have to worry about losing future passengers, thousands of them even, because there will always be enough replacement passengers. Budget airlines’ flights average above a 90% occupancy rate<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So the point of me never flying with easyJet again is not because i am under any illusion that it will be detrimental to their business, it won’t, but rather to protect <em>myself</em> should the situation happen again. They’re not the first airline to make my “list”, but the others have reasons that aren’t interesting enough to require a blog post.</p>

<p>What i am hoping with this post is that it gives the reader enough information that, should they find themselves in a similar situation, they are more informed as to their options and the potential ramifications of the choice they make. This is going to affect more travelers when the UK leaves the EU.</p>

<p>The second prefix is that easyJet recently posted their first year of losses<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">4</a></sup>, due to the current global situation. I started writing this post sometime in 2019, way before the pandemic royally fucked the airline industry. It’s arguable that the airline industry being royally fucked was only a matter of time, and the consequences of <em>that</em> could mean the details here are now even more relevant - It may become even harder to claim refunds and compensation from them in the future. Airline companies will probably double down on their approach to handling compensation claims to avoid yet more financial loss.</p>

<p><strong>EZY1952</strong></p>

<p>On 23rd December 2018 my partner and I were due to fly from Geneva to Manchester on easyJet flight EZY1952, aircraft registration G-EZRU, which was scheduled to depart at 16:50 CET and arrive at 17:50 GMT. I had booked these flights a couple of months earlier, which combined with the date of our departure and return lead to a total cost of 619.38 CHF.</p>

<p>The 600+ CHF didn’t include any of the optional extras, priority boarding, seat choice, checked bags, etc. It was the “basic” cost of the “cheap” flights. This cost is four to five times more than the normal cost of this route, as I said due to the relatively late booking (two months in advance) and the dates of the flights. This route is normally far cheaper:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/typical_cost.png"></p>

<p>Anyway, given the alternatives and the limited options for our dates these were the flights we settled on and decide the cost was worth it to spend Xmas with the family. The flight was delayed by just a few minutes, which isn’t unusual for this route, but then took off as normal at 17:14:05 CET.</p>

<p>A few moments after take off, the literal wheels no longer being on the ground part of it, I felt my ears pop quite suddenly. That might not be taken as unusual either, but I live at altitude and my ears don’t normally pop on flights. The plane then spent several minutes in low cloud, another unusual thing given the cloud line is normally cut through quicker. I turned to my partner and suggested that something was off.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later the pilot informed us that the flight would be returning to Geneva airport as the cabin pressure system, and its backup, had failed. Given the potentially catastrophic consequences of the cabin pressure system failing at cruising altitude, I considered that everyone on the plane had been very lucky.</p>

<p>The plane landed safely at Geneva airport at 17:41:00 CET, meaning a total flight time of about 25 minutes<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup>. I contacted my parents to let them know we wouldn’t be arriving as planned and would keep them informed as to any updates:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/messages_to_mum.png"></p>

<p>We remained on the plane, after the pilot informed us that the technical crew were going to look into the issue. We were then told the parts would be replaced/fixed and this would take three to four hours. At this point I knew that we would not be flying until the next day as a) it was now 19:00 and Geneva airport has strict limitations on flights after 22:00, and b) it would be massively irresponsible of the airline to let this plane fly without a more comprehensive test that would probably take longer than the three to four hour estimate<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since it was going to take a few hours all passengers disembarked and returned to the departure gate. I’m not sure how long we were on the plane, while it was on the ground, but looking at the evidence I kept afterwards it appears that we were on it for approximately one hour fifteen minutes. This is from the time it landed to receiving a text message from easyJet apologising for the delay:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/sorry_for_delay.png"></p>

<p>As soon as we got back into the gate I sat down and checked to see if there were any other flights available. Sure enough there was: we could get a one way easyJet flight to Liverpool, so I booked two seats for a total of 189.26 CHF. This flight would depart at 21:25 CET and arrive at 22:20 GMT, four hours and thirty minutes after our original arrival time.</p>

<p>It should be said at this point I was reasonably confident of a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was highly unlikely the original fight was going to depart that night</li>
  <li>In fact, it would probably be delayed until the next afternoon</li>
  <li>We would have all the inconvenience of that, and lose one third of our time in the UK</li>
  <li>Given the original arrival time was delayed by more than three hours we were covered by EU Regulation 261/2004</li>
  <li>So the airline would have to compensate €250 for each of us, which would at least cover the alternate flights I had booked</li>
</ul>

<p>I was correct on four out of five of these:</p>

<p><img width="625px" src="https://leejo.github.io/images/2020/EZY1952/delayed_overnight.png"></p>

<p>Our flight to Liverpool went without issue, and we weren’t the only people to have rebooked from the delayed flight as we overheard some other passengers explaining their situation to the cabin crew<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting easyJet Customer Service</strong></p>

<p>The next day I used easyJet’s contact form to submit a claim under EC261/2004 regulations. I knew this was going to take a long time so figured I may as well start the process as soon as possible. My claim was made on the basis that the original flight had been delayed overnight and I had booked alternate travel arrangements to get to my destination.</p>

<p>I considered the cost of the original flights a sunk cost. I wasn’t actually interested in compensation and I just wanted the cost of the alternate flights refunded, which came in at less than half the amount of compensation EC261/2004 would give considering the length of the delay to the original flight.</p>

<p>The response from easyJet came back quickly, the next day: <em>As you were a no show on the flight we would not be able t reimburse the costs for alternate transport.</em> - well that didn’t read like a response by someone/thing that had actually looked into the details. We had shown up for the flight, given we were on it when the pressure systems failed, and clearly we wouldn’t show up for the <em>rescheduled</em> flight if we arranged alternate transport as we can’t be in two places at once.</p>

<p>I assumed this was just a first level response of “refuse all claims, through a semantic dispute, because this will cause a not insignificant number of people to give up”<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>. The contact form doesn’t have a place to describe the reason for the claim in detail so I needed to call easyJet to explain.</p>

<p><strong>EU Regulation 261/2004</strong></p>

<p>I’ll spare you too much detail, as you can search for it if you want to (or read a summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Compensation_Regulation">Wikipedia</a>). Essentially - EU 261/2004 allows compensation if your flight is from or to an EU/EAA area and is either delayed or cancelled [less than one week before the flight date]. The level of compensation depends on the distance of the flight.</p>

<p>In this particular case the delay was more than four hours, and the flight was less than 1,500km, so would qualify for €250 compensation (per passenger).</p>

<p>The regulation also says the passengers must be given assistance, and in this particular case of the flight being delayed overnight would mean hotel accommodation and transport between the airport and the hotel. This was Geneva two days from Xmas, so that would probably mean another €250.</p>

<p>So a reasonable estimate is easyJet would be paying in the region of €750 per passenger on this delayed flight. Given it was full (at least to my recollection) easyJet were looking at a bill of at least €100,000 for compensation + accommodation expenses<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To go off on a tangent slightly - all of this is going to be up in the air when the UK leaves the EU. Of course that depends what the UK government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Compensation_Regulation#Brexit_and_British_Consumers">decide to do about it</a>. Given everything else on their plate don’t be surprised if this one gets forgotten about until the claims start to appear.</p>

<p><strong>Contacting easyJet Customer Service Again</strong></p>

<p>As my claim, via easyJet’s web form, was rejected relatively quickly I decided to pick up the phone and see if speaking to someone would make a difference. I explained the situation and they agreed to pass this on to someone who would look at it in more detail, given the time of year this would take a few days at the least.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks later I received an email stating “Unfortunately as you were a no show on the transferred flight there is no reimbursement for EUC216 Compensation”. But also “As a goodwill gesture I have created a flight voucher to the value of the 51.90 GBP”.</p>

<p>Slightly odd - no …</p></div></div>

<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/peek.webm"><video src="https://djharper.dev/img/peek.webm" loop="true" width="100%" title="The pixels have been adjusted in colour slightly." autoplay=""></video></a>
<figcaption><br>It's an image <i>and</i> a program</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A few weeks ago I was reading about <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>, a fantasy games console with limited constraints. What really piqued my interest about it was the novel way games are distributed, you encode them into a PNG image. This includes the game code, assets, everything. The image can be whatever you want, screenshots from the game, cool artwork or just text. To load them you pass the image as input to the PICO-8 program and start playing.</p>
<p>This got me thinking, wouldn’t it be cool if you could do that for programs on Linux? No! I hear you cry, that’s a dumb idea, but whatever, herein lies an overview of possibly the dumbest things I’ve worked on this year.</p>
<h2 id="encoding">Encoding</h2>
<p>I’m not entirely sure what PICO-8 is actually doing, but at a guess it’s probably use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> techniques to ‘hide’ the data within the raw bytes of the image. There are a lot of resources out there that explain how Steganography works, but the crux of it is quite simple, your image your want to hide data into is made up of bytes, an image is made up of pixels. Pixels are made up of 3 Red Green and Blue (RGB) values, represented as 3 bytes. To hide your data (the “payload”) you essentially “mix” the bytes from your payload with the bytes from the image.</p>
<p>If you just replaced each byte in your cover image with the bytes from your payload, you would end up with sections of the image looking distorted as the colours probably wouldn’t match with what your original image was. The trick is to be as subtle as possible, or <em>hide in plain sight</em>. This can be achieved by <em>spreading</em> your payload bytes over the bytes of the cover image by using the <em>least significant bits</em> to hide them in. In other words, make subtle adjustments to the byte values so the colour changes are not drastic enough to be perceptive by the human eye.</p>
<p>For example if your payload was the letter <code>H</code>, represented as <code>01001000</code> in binary (72), and your image contained a series of black pixels</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/byte-replace1.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/byte-replace1.png" title="The bits from the input bytes are spread across 8 output bytes by hiding them in the least significant bit"></a>
<figcaption><br>The bits from the input bytes are spread across 8 output bytes by hiding them in the least significant bit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The output is two-and-a-bit pixels that are slightly less black than before, but can you tell the difference?</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/pixels1.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/pixels1.png" title="The pixels have been adjusted in colour slightly."></a>
<figcaption><br>The pixels have been adjusted in colour slightly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Well, an exceptionally trained colour connoisseur might be able to, but in reality these subtle shifts can really only be noticed by a machine. Retrieving your super secret <code>H</code> is just a matter of reading 8 bytes from the resulting image and re-assembling them back into 1 byte. Obviously hiding a single letter is lame, but this can scale to anything you want, a super secret sentence, a copy of <em>War and Peace</em>, a link to your soundcloud, the go compiler, the only limit is the amount of bytes available in your cover image as you’ll require at least 8x whatever your input is.</p>
<h2 id="hiding-programs">Hiding programs</h2>
<p>So, back to the whole linux-executables-in-an-image thing, that old chestnut. Well, seeing as executables are just bytes, they can be hidden in images. Just like in the PICO-8 thing.</p>
<p>Before I could achieve this I decided to write my own <a href="https://github.com/djhworld/steg">Steganography library</a> and <a href="https://github.com/djhworld/stegtool">tool</a> to support encoding and decoding data into PNGs. Yes, there are lots of steganography libraries and tools out there but I learn better by building.</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ stegtool encode <span>\
</span><span></span>--cover-image htop-logo.png <span>\
</span><span></span>--input-data /usr/bin/htop <span>\
</span><span></span>--output-image htop.png
$
$ <span>echo</span> <span>"Super secret hidden message"</span> | stegtool encode <span>\ </span>
--cover-image image.png <span>\
</span><span></span>--output-image image-with-hidden-message.png
$ stegtool decode --image image-with-hidden-message.png
Super secret hidden message</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>As it’s all written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> it wasn’t that difficult to compile to WASM, so feel free to play with it here:</p>

<p>Anyway, now that can embed data, including executables into an image, how do we run them?</p>
<h2 id="get-it-running">Get it running</h2>
<p>The simple option would be to just run the tool above, <code>decode</code> the data into a new file, <code>chmod +x</code> it and then run it. It works but that’s not fun enough. What I wanted was something similar to the PICO-8 experience, you pass something a PNG image and it takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, you can’t just load some arbitrary set of bytes into memory and tell Linux to jump to it. Well, not in a direct way anyway, but you <em>can</em> use some cheap tricks to fudge it.</p>
<h2 id="memfd-create">memfd_create</h2>
<p>After reading <a href="https://magisterquis.github.io/2018/03/31/in-memory-only-elf-execution.html">this blogpost</a> it became apparent to me you can create an in-memory file and mark it as executable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to just grab a chunk of memory, put our binary in there, and run it without monkey-patching the kernel, rewriting execve(2) in userland, or loading a library into another process?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method uses the syscall <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create(2)</a> to create a file under the <code>/proc/self/fd</code> namespace of your process and load any data you want in it using <code>write</code>. I spent quite a while messing around with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/libc">libc</a> bindings for Rust to get this to work, and had a lot of trouble understanding the data types you pass around, the documentation for these Rust bindings doesn’t help much.</p>
<p>I got something working eventually though</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>unsafe</span><span> </span>{<span>

</span><span>        </span>file,<span>
</span><span>    </span>);<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>Invoking <code>/proc/self/fd/&lt;fd&gt;</code> as a child process from the parent that created it is enough to run your binary.</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span><span> </span>output<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span>Command::new(format<span>!</span>(<span>"/proc/self/fd/{}"</span>,<span> </span>fd))<span>
</span><span>    </span>.args(args)<span>
</span><span>    </span>.stdin(std::process::Stdio::inherit())<span>
</span><span>    </span>.stdout(std::process::Stdio::inherit())<span>
</span><span>    </span>.stderr(std::process::Stdio::inherit())<span>
</span><span>    </span>.spawn();<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>Given these building blocks, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/djhworld/pngrun">pngrun</a> to run the images. It essentially…</p>
<ol>
<li>Accepts an image that has had our binary embedded in it from the steganography tool, and any arguments</li>
<li>Decodes it (i.e. extracts and re-assembles the bytes)</li>
<li>Creates an in-memory file using <code>memfd_create</code></li>
<li>Puts the bytes of the binary into the in-memory file</li>
<li>Invokes the file <code>/proc/self/fd/&lt;fd&gt;</code> as a child process, passing any arguments from the parent</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can run it like this</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ pngrun htop.png
&lt;htop output&gt;
$ pngrun go.png run main.go
Hello world!</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>Once <code>pngrun</code> exits the in-memory file is destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="binfmt-misc">binfmt_misc</h2>
<p>It’s annoying having to type <code>pngrun</code> every time though, so my last cheap trick to this pointless gimmick was to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc">binfmt_misc</a>, a system that allows you to “execute” files based on its file types. I think it was mainly designed for interpreters/virtual machines, like Java. So instead of typing <code>java -jar my-jar.jar</code> you can just type <code>./my-jar.jar</code> and it will invoke the <code>java</code> process to run your JAR. The caveat is your file <code>my-jar.jar</code> needs to be marked as executable first.</p>
<p>So adding an entry to binfmt_misc for <code>pngrun</code> to attempt to run any <code>png</code> files that have the <code>x</code> flag set was as simple as</p>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ cat /etc/binfmt.d/pngrun.conf
:ExecutablePNG:E::png::/home/me/bin/pngrun:
$ sudo systemctl restart binfmt.d
$ chmod +x htop.png
$ ./htop.png
&lt;output&gt;</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<h2 id="what-s-the-point">What’s the point</h2>
<p>Well, there isn’t one really. I was seduced by the idea of making PNG images run programs and got a bit carried away with it, but it was fun none the less. There’s something amusing to me about distributing programs as an image, remember the ridiculous cardboard boxes PC software used to come in with artwork on the front, why not bring that back! (lets not)</p>
<p>It’s really dumb though and comes with a lot of caveats that make it completely pointless and impractical, the main one being needing the stupid <code>pngrun</code> program on your machine. But I also noticed some weird stuff around programs like <code>clang</code>. I encoded it into this fun LLVM logo and while it runs OK, it fails when you try to compile something.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/DragonMedium.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/DragonMedium.png" title="Clang/LLVM logo"></a>
</figure>
<figure>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ./clang.png --version
clang version <span>11</span>.0.0 <span>(</span>Fedora <span>11</span>.0.0-2.fc33<span>)</span>
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /proc/self/fd
$ ./clang.png main.c
error: unable to execute command: Executable <span>""</span> doesn<span>'</span>t exist!</code></pre></div>
</figure>
<p>This is probably a product of the anonymous file thing, which can probably be overcome if I could be bothered to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="additional-reasons-why-this-is-dumb">Additional reasons why this is dumb</h3>
<p>A lot of binaries are quite large, and given the constraints of needing to fit them into an image, sometimes these need to be <em>big</em>, meaning you end up with comically large files.</p>
<p>Also most software isn’t just one executable so the dream of just distributing a PNG kinda falls flat for more complex software like games.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is probably the dumbest project I’ve worked on all year but it’s been fun, I’ve learned about Steganography, <code>memfd_create</code>, <code>binfmt_misc</code> and played a little more with Rust.</p>

								<p>"Oakland relaxed a lot of zoning, and permitting regulations about 5 years ago, and so now you're starting to really see production sky rocket. This article [0] mentions 2019 was had 15x more units completed than 2018. And 3x the total units from 2013-2018 combined. Anecdotally, I have several friends who've all moved to Oakland in the last year or so. It will be interesting to see how this plays out, and maybe, hopefully, SF will take the hint.[0] - https://www.city-journal.org/oakland-rezoning-california-hou..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p>"Don't ask, Don't get.Everyone I know who has asked for a discount has got the discount.After several months of the pandemic, and noticing the adjacent apartment being relisted by my landlord at a discount I emailed my landlord and asked if I could have my rent adjusted by the same discount. They said yes, if I committed to another years lease.Saving 5% of rent, at the cost of a one year commitment didn't seem like a win, so I politely declined explaining my reasoning, and suggested we leave things as they are.A week or so later, out of the blue by my rent got adjusted by 10%+ instead of 5% with no need to commit to stay.Sufficed to say, if their intention was for me to stay put, it worked!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p>"&gt; the weighted average asking rent for an apartment in the city, which currently measures around 2.3 bedrooms when counting a studio as having one, has dropped to $3,100 a month.Still too high. Was checking into apartment prices earlier in the year and it is amazing the number of landlords that will try and sell you on a “kitchen” that is a mini-fridge, tiny sink, microwave and a hot plate whilst still charging you full rent.San Francisco’s rental market is a good lesson in how supply and demand informs pricing that the residents and the Board of Supervisors alike continuously and willfully ignore."</p>
