<p>Rustler is a fantastic project built to make writing Rust NIFs a simple process;
and the upcoming v0.22 release will provide a much cleaner syntax to do so. The
library handles encoding and decoding Rust values into Erlang terms, catches
Rust panics before they unwind to C and <em>should</em> make it impossible to crash the
BEAM from a Rust NIF.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-rustler">Getting started with Rustler</h2>
<p>One of my first forays into Rust-implemented NIFs was while building a
micro-library providing Base64 encoding and decoding, creatively named
<a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base64</a>. It's utterly pointless as that
functionality comes built-in to Elixir but I wanted to start with something
simple. On the plus side, this meant I could easily compare the performance of
the NIF version to the Elixir implementation which can be found in the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Base.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Base</code> module</a>.</p>
<p>The library consists of two functions: <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> and it's using
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64</a> to do the heavy
lifting in the NIFs. Let's walk through how this all works.</p>
<p>To get started, we need a new mix project with rustler installed as a
dependency.</p>
<pre><code>mix new base64

mix deps.get
mix rustler.new
</code></pre><p>Let's explore the project's resulting structure (I've left out the usual Elixir
files and directories and focused on <code>lib</code> and <code>native</code>):</p>
<pre><code>.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base64.ex
â””â”€â”€ native
    â””â”€â”€ base64_nif
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
        â””â”€â”€ src
            â””â”€â”€ lib.rs</code></pre><ul>
<li><code>lib</code> will contain Elixir code (like any standard mix project).</li>
<li><code>base64.ex</code> will contain the stubs to our NIFs. This is the Elixir module the
NIF module will be registered to.</li>
<li><code>native</code> will be home to the Rust code. In fact, a cargo package has been
created within this directory (in this case named <code>base64_nif</code>).</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code> will contain the NIFs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust NIFs are compiled and linked into a shared library loaded by Erlang
code at runtime. Elixir (or Erlang) implementations of the functions are also
necessary. These are usually minimal stubs defining the name and arity of the
NIFs and serve as fallback implementations if the NIFs aren't loaded. Let's
start with the Elixir stubs.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>defmodule</span> <span>Base64</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> Rustler, <span>otp_app:</span> <span>:base64</span>, <span>crate:</span> <span>"base64_nif"</span>

  <span>@spec</span> decode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>decode</span></span>(_b64, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span>@spec</span> encode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>encode</span></span>(_s, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span><span>defp</span> <span>error</span></span>(), <span>do:</span> <span>:erlang</span>.nif_error(<span>:nif_not_loaded</span>)
<span>end</span></code></pre><p>The first line is configuration and lets Rustler know what Rust crate to compile
for the Elixir module.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <code>decode/2</code> and <code>encode/2</code> don't actually implement any
decoding or encoding; they simply call <code>error/0</code> if the NIFs can't be found.
However, the names and the arguments must match in both the Rust and Elixir
implementations. Both functions take in a <code>binary</code> to be encoded or decoded and
an <code>atom</code> for configuration as different character sets that can be used
(url-safe, without padding, etc...). The default is fittingly set to
<code>:standard</code>. The Rust NIFs are implemented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>use</span> base64;
<span>use</span> rustler::Atom;

<span>mod</span> atoms {
    rustler::atoms! {
      crypt,
      imap_map7,
      standard,
      standard_no_pad,
      url_safe,
      url_safe_no_pad,
    }
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>decode</span></span>(b64: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    <span>let</span> bytes = base64::decode_config(b64, config).expect(<span>"decode failed: invalid b64"</span>);

    <span>String</span>::from_utf8(bytes).unwrap()
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>encode</span></span>(s: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    base64::encode_config(s.as_bytes(), config)
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>match_config</span></span>(option: Atom) -&gt; base64::Config {
    
}

rustler::init!(<span>"Elixir.Base64"</span>, [decode, encode]);</code></pre><p>The last line is interesting: <code>rustler::init</code> is a procedural macro that allows
the use of <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> to annotate functions to be wrapped as NIFs. It
takes in the name of the Elixir module in which the stubs are defined (in this
case <code>"Elixir.Base64"</code>) and an array containing the names of the functions
annotated as NIFs (in this case <code>[decode, encode]</code>). In short, this links
everything together.</p>
<p>The use statements at the top of the file are importing the
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64 crate</a> (<code>base64</code>)
mentioned earlier, which we'll use for encoding and decoding, and the
<code>rustler::Atom</code> type which allows us to represent an Elixir/Erlang <code>atom</code> in
Rust. Both the <code>rustler</code> and <code>base64</code> crates have been added to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>
dependencies.</p>
<p>The <code>rustler::atoms</code> macro defines Rust functions that return Erlang atoms; in
this case, the possible options for the <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> functions.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the NIF definitions. The functions take in a <code>String</code> and a
<code>rustler::Atom</code>, and return a <code>String</code>. This is consistent with the Elixir
stubs, as are the names. In this case, the conversions between Rust values and
Elixir terms are conveniently handled by Rustler. However, for more complex
types, this may need to be implemented manually.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare-to-the-elixir-implementation">How does it compare to the Elixir implementation?</h2>
<p>Rust is fast. Really fast. This was my set-up (using
<a href="https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchee</a>):</p>
<pre><code>Operating System: macOS
CPU Information: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4258U CPU @ 2.40GHz
Number of Available Cores: 4
Available memory: 16 GB
Elixir 1.10.2
Erlang 22.3.2</code></pre><p>I used <em>hello world</em> as the short string and Sarah Kayâ€™s poem
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B (If I Should Have a Daughter)</a></em>
as the longer string.</p>
<p>Decoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           175.74 K
Elixir/Erlang decode        4.35 K - 40.37x slower +224.03 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           953.17 K
Elixir/Erlang decode      555.63 K - 1.72x slower +0.75 Î¼s</code></pre><p>Encoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           203.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode        6.95 K - 29.23x slower +138.98 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           941.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode      615.62 K - 1.53x slower +0.56 Î¼s</code></pre><p>As the data to encode or decode becomes larger, the overhead of creating the
NIFs becomes smaller and the gains in speed are impressive. These results were
obtained with fairly small data and so the potential performance gains possible
by leveraging Rust NIFs when dealing with CPU-intensive tasks are exciting.</p>
<p>I left out the memory usage comparisons but the Elixir/Erlang implementations
used 3-5x more memory than the NIFs.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-rustler-makes-it-easy-to-implement-nifs">TL;DR: Rustler makes it easy to implement NIFs</h2>
<p>Other than the <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> function annotations and the <code>rustler::init</code>
call, nothing more is required to implement Rust NIFs with Rustler. The
boilerplate and the complexities of translating Rust values to Erlang terms
being handled by the library, there's little resistance to leveraging the power
of Rust in Elixir/Erlang.</p>

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>On a recent project we gained the ability to specify environment variables but not the process that was executed.
We were also unable to control the contents of a file on disk, and bruteforcing process identifiers (PIDs) and file descriptors found no interesting results, eliminating <a href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/goahead/">remote LD_PRELOAD exploitation</a>.
Fortunately, a scripting language interpreter was executed which enabled us to execute arbitrary commands by specifying particular environment variables.
This blog post discusses how arbitrary commands can be executed by a range of scripting language interpreters when supplied with malicious environment variables.</p>



<p>A quick read of the <code>ENVIRONMENT</code> section of the <code>perlrun(1)</code> man page reveals plenty of environment variables worth investigating.
The <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable allows specifying command-line options, but is restricted to only accepting the options <code>CDIMTUWdmtw</code>.
This unfortunately means that <code>-e</code>, which allows supplying perl code to run, is out.</p>

<p>All is not lost though, as demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HackerFantastic/exploits/blob/master/cve-2016-1531.sh">exploit</a> for CVE-2016-1531 by <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic">Hacker Fantastic</a>.
The exploit writes a malicious perl module to <code>/tmp/root.pm</code> and supplies the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-Mroot</code> and <code>PERL5LIB=/tmp</code> to achieve arbitrary code execution.
However this was an exploit for a local privilege escalation vulnerability and a generic technique should ideally not require access to the file system. Looking at <a href="https://twitter.com/bl4sty">blasty</a>’s <a href="https://haxx.in/blasty-vs-exim.sh">exploit</a> for the same CVE, the exploit did not require creating a file and used the environment variables <code>PERL5OPT=-d</code> and <code>PERL5DB=system("sh");exit;</code>.
The same environment variables were also used to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/1dm8fv/hack_this_website_and_win_bitcoins_the_first/c9tm6j4/">solve a CTF challenge</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>One final nicety of a generic technique would be to use a single environment variable instead of two.
<a href="https://twitter.com/justinsteven">@justinsteven</a> found this was possible by leveraging <code>PERL5OPT=-M</code>.
While either <code>-m</code> or <code>-M</code> can be used to load a perl module, the <code>-M</code> option allows adding extra code after the module name.</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>--env</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`)'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl /dev/null
<span>uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>



<p>Reading the <code>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</code> section of the <code>python(1)</code> man page, <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> initially appears like it may be a piece of a straightforward solution.
It allows specifying a path to a Python script that will be executed prior to displaying the prompt in interactive mode.
The interactive mode requirement didn’t seem like it would be an issue as the <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> environment variable can be used to enter interactive mode, the same as specifying <code>-i</code> on the command line.
However, the documentation for the <code>-i</code> option explains that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> will not be used when python is started with a script to execute.
This means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> and <code>PYTHONINSPECT</code> cannot be combined and <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> only has an effect when the python REPL is immediately launched.
This ultimately means that <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> is not viable as it has no effect when executing a regular Python script.</p>

<p>Other environment variables which looked promising were <code>PYTHONHOME</code> and <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Both of these will let you gain arbitrary code execution but require you to also be able to create directories and files on the filesystem. It may be possible to loosen those requirements through the use of the proc filesystem and/or ZIP files.</p>

<p>The majority of the remaining environment variables are simply checked if they contain a non-empty string, and if so, toggle a generally benign setting. One of the rare exceptions to this is <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code>.</p>

<h2 id="making-progress-with-pythonwarnings">Making progress with PYTHONWARNINGS</h2>
<p>The documentation for <code>PYTHONWARNINGS</code> states <code>it is equivalent to specifying the -W option</code>. The <code>-W</code> option is used for warning control to specify which warnings and how often they are printed. The full form of argument is <code>action:message:category:module:line</code>. While warning control didn’t seem like a promising lead, that quickly changed after checking the implementation.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-1: Python-3.8.2/Lib/warnings.py</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>[...]</span>

<span>[...]</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>The above code shows that as long as our specified category contains a dot, we can trigger the import an arbitrary Python module.</p>

<p>The next problem is that the vast majority of modules from Python’s standard library run very little code when imported. They tend to just define classes to be used later, and even when they provide code to run, the code is typically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html">guarded with a check of the <code>__main__</code> variable</a> (to detect if the file has been imported or run directly).</p>

<p>An unexpected exception to this is the <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">antigravity module</a>. The Python developers included an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">easter egg</a> in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/206e3074d34aeb5a4d0c1e24d970b6569f7ad702">2008</a> which can be triggered by running <code>import antigravity</code>. This import will immediately open your browser to the xkcd comic that joked that <code>import antigravity</code> in Python would grant you the ability to fly.</p>

<p>As for how the <code>antigravity</code> module opens your browser, it uses another module from the standard library called <code>webbrowser</code>. This module checks your PATH for a large variety of browsers, including mosaic, opera, skipstone, konqueror, chrome, chromium, firefox, links, elinks and lynx. It also accepts an environment variable <code>BROWSER</code> that lets you specify which process should be executed. It is not possible to supply arguments to the process in the environment variable and the xkcd comic URL is the one hard-coded argument for the command.</p>

<p>The ability to turn this into arbitrary code execution depends on what other executables are available on the system.</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-perl-for-arbitrary-code-execution">Leveraging Perl for Arbitrary Code Execution</h2>

<p>One approach is to leverage Perl which is commonly installed on systems and is even available in the standard Python docker image. However, the <code>perl</code> binary cannot itself be used. This is because the first and only argument is the xkcd comic URL. The comic URL argument will cause an error and the process to exit without the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable being used.</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption>Figure-2: PERL5OPT having no effect when a URL is passed to perl</figcaption>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>docker run <span>-e</span> <span>'PERL5OPT=-Mbase;print(`id`);exit'</span> perl:5.30.2 perl https://xkcd.com/353/
<span>Can't open perl script "https://xkcd.com/353/": No such file or directory</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>Fortunately, when Perl is available it also common to have the default Perl scripts available, such as perldoc and perlthanks. These scripts will also error and exit with an invalid argument, but the error in this case happens later than the processing of the <code>PERL5OPT</code> environment variable. This means you can leverage the Perl environment variable payload detailed earlier in this blog post.</p>

<figure>

<p>A <a href="https://research.securitum.com/prototype-pollution-rce-kibana-cve-2019-7609/">blog post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/securitymb">Michał Bentkowski</a> provided a payload for exploiting Kibana (CVE-2019-7609). A prototype pollution vulnerability was used to set arbitrary environment variables which resulted in arbitrary command execution. Michał’s payload used the <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code> environment variable and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">proc filesystem</a>, specifically <code>/proc/self/environ</code>.</p>

<p>Although Michał’s technique was creative and worked perfectly for their vulnerability, the technique is not always guaranteed to work and has some constraints that would be nice to remove.</p>

<p>The first constraint is that it using <code>/proc/self/environ</code> is only viable if the contents can be made to be syntactically valid JavaScript. This requires being able to create an environment variable and have it appear first in the contents of <code>/proc/self/environ</code>, or knowing/bruteforcing the environment variable’s name that will appear first and overwriting it’s value.</p>

<p>Another constraint, as the first environment variable’s value finishes with a single line comment (<code>//</code>). Therefore, any newline character in other environment variables will likely cause a syntax error and prevent the payload from executing. The use of multi-line comments (<code>/*</code>) will not fix this issue as they must be closed to be syntactically valid. Therefore, in the rare case that an environment variable contains a newline character, it is required to know/bruteforce the environment variable’s name and overwrite it’s value to a new value that does not contain a newline.</p>

<p>Removing these contraints is an exercise left for the reader.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The finance world is quickly entering the mainstream —</p><p>Every month a notable company goes public. Every week a hot startup raises millions of dollars. And every day moms, pops, and teens check on their stocks. </p><p>Whether a company builds rocket engines or mobile apps, they tell their story using the same language —&nbsp;financial statements. Here's how they work.</p><p>Let's say you run a subscription t-shirt business.</p><p>It's going well — you have happy customers and healthy profit. You're thinking of buying your own factory to make more t-shirts, more quickly, and more cheaply.</p><p>There's just one problem — you can't afford a factory.</p><p>So, you ask the bank for a loan. Your company is profitable and the factory will pay for itself in 3 years, so you know you'll be able to pay it back. But while you know this, the bank doesn't — you'll need to convince them. The bank, however, doesn't know anything about the subscription clothing business.</p><p>To get on the same page, you need a shared language for talking about your business.</p><p><h4 id="heading-1">Double-entry Bookkeeping: The birth of accounting</h4></p><p>Double-entry bookkeeping was the first formalism in finance. The Middle East had it in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697986" target="_blank">first century AD</a>, Korea independently got it in the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1598-2661" target="_blank">11th century</a>, and by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232023/http://130.74.92.202:82/record=b1000778" target="_blank">1500s</a>, it had been well-documented across Europe.</p><p>It's a simple concept designed to reduce errors when documenting transactions: every entry to an "account" requires an equal and opposite entry to another "account".</p><p>If you bought some cotton to turn into t-shirts, you might record the transaction like this:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-371c827e421c-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde0379b53032713cde77_bookkeeping.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Note: This example is to illustrate the double-entry concept. In practice, 'Cash' would be credited here since it's an asset, and 'Materials' would be debited, since it's a cost. </figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>When you spend $100 on cotton, your "Cash" account gets debited (loses) $100, and your "Materials" account gets credited (gains) $100. The underlying principle is that <em>you can't create something out of nothing</em>.</p><p>This might seem contrived, but with more and more transactions, it can help you spot errors. Since every entry has an equal and opposite entry, the sum of all the debits should always equal the sum of all the credits. If not, you know you made a mistake, and you can look back through your transactions to find it.</p><p>A list of transactions is pretty interesting — it tells a very detailed story about what your company's been up to. Certainly enough to answer the bank's questions when you ask for loan.</p><p>But just as the bank doesn't have time to learn about subscription t-shirts businesses, they don't have time to go through thousands of transactions. To understand what's going on, they need a shorter summary.</p><p><h4 id="heading-2">Financial Statement #1: The Balance Sheet</h4></p><p>If you went through all your transactions and worked out the net value of each account, you'd be able to see things like</p><ul role="list"><li>How much cash you have in the bank</li><li>The total value of the cotton in your inventory</li><li>How much money you owe to your cotton suppliers</li></ul><p>This will give you a snapshot of the current state of your company, split up into "everything you own" (<strong>Assets</strong>) and "everything you owe" (<strong>Liabilities</strong>) — a <strong>Balance Sheet</strong>. These generally won't be equal — ideally your assets will be worth more than your liabilities.</p><p>The difference between the assets and the liabilities is what you, the owner of the company, can rightfully stake a claim to. Crudely, if you sold all your assets today and used that money to pay off all your debts, you'd be left with a pile of cash all to yourself.</p><p>This idea is usually expressed by the "accounting equation":</p><p><strong>Assets - Liabilities = Shareholders Equity</strong></p><p>This is where the "balance" comes in: both sides of the equation are equal. Note that this equation is actually a definition — it asserts that the value of the <strong>Shareholders Equity</strong> is the difference between <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Liabilities</strong>. This is the same equation that underpins double-entry bookkeeping.</p><p>Here's what your balance sheet might look like:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-89b5b437bd58-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefde1a11602b68a068a079_balance-sheet.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The bank will be interested in seeing this before giving you a loan. It's a quick 'n' dirty way for them to understand the big picture:</p><ul role="list"><li>The orders of magnitude involved — does this company operate in the thousands, millions, or billions?</li><li>An estimate for how much the company is "worth", based on the shareholders equity</li><li>An indication of company health — is the company drowning in debt?</li></ul><p>Financiers often calculate metrics based on the balance sheet, to further summarise the information and to compare numbers across companies.</p><p>The <strong>Debt/Equity Ratio</strong> is a big one, telling you how much a company relies on borrowing money. If it's too high then the company might be too dependent on loans, but if it's too low, this might indicate an inefficiency, since borrowing money to spend on growth can be quicker than earning it the hard way.</p><p>So — the balance sheet summarises a lot about your company, in a way that the bank can understand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't answer a crucial question — "Do you make money?"</p><p><h4 id="heading-3">Financial Statement #2: The Income Statement (P&amp;L)</h4></p><p>The balance sheet is a snapshot of a single point in time. To understand whether a company makes money, you need see how things change over a period of time (e.g. every month).</p><p>The first thing you need to know is how much money you receive — your <strong>Revenue</strong>. You don't keep all of it — there are costs and expenses along the way — so you need to subtract these. The final number you end up with is your <strong>Profit</strong> — the money you've made at the end of the day.</p><p>Here's how you might do the calculation:</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-a4e76259fbb4-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe0c6c8f0be2b6743533b_p%26l.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>You start at Revenue (the top line), subtract your costs, and end up at Profit (the "bottom line" — get it?). This is a simple <strong>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</strong>, or <strong>Income Statement</strong>. Most companies make one every month, to keep an eye on things. </p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-fec0fade16bf-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe17879b5309ce33ce18b_35274025-14536291245349646_origin.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>With a P&amp;L, you and the bank can understand what's going in and out of your business. If your P&amp;L consistently shows a profit, then the bank will be happy, and so will you.</p><p>In theory, this is very simple. But in practice, each P&amp;L item has hidden nuances to address.</p><p>Let's take just the top line — what does <strong>Revenue</strong> actually mean?</p><p><strong>What is revenue?</strong></p><p>When you started selling shirts, it was a simpler time — you bought them in bulk from China and sold them at the local market.</p><p>Revenue, too, was simple — it was the cold hard cash in your hand.</p><p>But things changed. You started taking bulk orders from shops, who pay you 1 month after you deliver the shirts. And when you went online, your customers started paying you for 12 month subscriptions, all in one go.</p><p>It turns out that if you keep thinking of revenue as "cash in your hand", then things get a little weird —</p><ul role="list"><li>When you get a bulk order, your expenses shoot up. But since you don't get paid until next month, your profit goes way down this month.</li><li>When someone buys a 12-month subscription, your revenue spikes up. But for the next 11 months you have to keep delivering on the order (non-zero cost) without further payments (zero revenue) — your bottom line takes a hit.</li></ul><p>Bulk orders and upfront payments are great for your business, but if revenue means "cash in hand", then your P&amp;L might tell the opposite story.</p><p>A better way to think about revenue is as "the value of products delivered or service provided".</p><p>In each month of a subscription, you do 1 month of work. So even with 12 months' payment upfront, you only recognise 1/12th of that payment as revenue each month. The remaining 11/12th becomes <strong>Deferred Revenue.</strong> This is actually a liability on your balance sheet — your customers have essentially given you a loan which you must pay back each month, in the form of t-shirts.</p><p>The same principle applies for bulk orders — you recognise the revenue when you deliver the product, <em>not</em> when you get paid.</p><p>This is called <strong>Accrual Accounting</strong>, and it more accurately answers the question "Do you make money?".</p><p>So — you've got a balance sheet, showing your current financial state, and you've got a P&amp;L, showing how things change over time. The bank, however, remains unsatisfied.</p><p>Sadly, consistent profits, measured with accrual accounting, can still leave you penniless on payday.</p><p><h4 id="heading-4">Financial Statement #3: The Cashflow Statement</h4></p><p>In 1863, the Dowlais Iron Company had a dilemma.</p><p>On paper, things were great — they'd recovered from a downturn and were posting healthy profits. To smelt more iron, they set out to buy a new blast furnace. But despite their promising P&amp;L, it turned out that they had no cash to buy it.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Their problem was in spending cash too quickly — as soon as they got some, they'd use it on inventory (iron ore, etc). The profits were rolling in, but the cash wasn't sticking around.</p><p>The company needed a way to understand how cash was coming in and out — the cashflow. Their solution was the origin of the modern <strong>Cashflow Statement</strong>.</p><p>Like the P&amp;L, the cashflow statement shows how things change over each month, but crucially, it only focuses on cash — how much you started with, what you spent it on, where you got more of it, and how much you ended up with. In short, the cashflow statement explains the difference between one balance sheet and the next.</p><figure id="w-node-508193268673-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5eefe644e9cf27ec56e99c29_Untitled-3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The bank should now have enough information to decide whether to give you a loan:</p><ul role="list"><li>Balance Sheet — shows everything that you own, and everything that you owe</li><li>P&amp;L/Income Statement — shows how your business operates</li><li>Cashflow Statement — shows how you spend and earn cash</li></ul><p>These financial statements are a shared language, letting businesses communicate across industries and borders.

                        <p>The vast majority of serious malware&nbsp;<a href="https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/malsource_raid16.pdf">over the past 30 years</a>&nbsp;has been written in Assembly or compiled languages such as C, C++, and Delphi. However, ever-increasing over the past decade, a large amount of malware has been written in interpreted languages, such as Python. The low barrier to entry, ease of use, rapid development process, and massive library collection has made Python attractive for millions of developers- including malware authors. Python has quickly become a standard language in which threat actors create Remote Access Trojans (RATs), information stealers, and vulnerability exploit tools. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/python-is-eating-the-world-how-one-developers-side-project-became-the-hottest-programming-language-on-the-planet/">Python continues to grow radically in popularity</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/malware-against-the-c-monoculture/">C malware monoculture</a>&nbsp;continues to be challenged, it would seem only certain that Python will be increasingly utilized as malware in cyber attacks.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python_growth.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="660" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python_growth.jpg 770w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python_growth-300x257.jpg 300w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/python_growth-768x658.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px"></p>

<p>In comparison to a standard compiled language like C, writing malware in Python comes with a whole host of difficulties. The first being that Python is required to be installed on the operating system in order to interpret and execute Python code. However, as we’ll see in the next section, a Python program can easily be converted into a native executable using a variety of different methods.</p>
<p>Malware written in Python will also have adverse effects on file size, memory footprint, and processing power. Serious malware is often designed to be small, stealthy, have low memory footprint, and use limited processing power. A compiled malware sample written in C might be 200 KB, while a comparable malware sample written in Python might be 20 MB after converted into an executable. Both the CPU &amp; RAM usage will also be significantly higher when using an interpreted language.</p>
<p>However, it’s 2020 and the digital landscape isn’t what it once was. The internet is faster than it’s ever been, our computers have more memory &amp; storage capacity than ever, and CPUs get faster every year. Python is also more ubiquitous than ever, coming pre-installed on macOS and most all Linux distributions by default.</p>

<p>Microsoft Windows is still the primary target for most malicious campaigns, and it does not come with Python installed by default. Therefore, for threat actors to distribute their malware effectively they must convert their Python code into an executable format. There are many methods to “compile Python” into a native executable. Let’s take a look at the few most popular methods…</p>
<h3>PyInstaller</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png" alt="" width="500" height="100" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller.png 500w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pyinstaller-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a>&nbsp;is capable of building Python applications into stand-alone executables for Windows, Linux, macOS and more by “freezing” Python code. It is one of the most popular methods to convert Python code into executable format and has been used widely for both legitimate and malicious purposes.</p>
<p>Let’s create a simple “Hello, world!” program in Python and freeze it into a stand-alone executable using PyInstaller:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyinstaller --onefile hello.py
...

$ ./dist/hello 
Hello, world!

$ file dist/hello 
dist/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=294d1f19a085a730da19a6c55788ec08c2187039, stripped

$ du -sh dist/hello 
7.0M    dist/hello
</code></pre>
<p>This process created a portable, stand-alone Linux ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) which is the equivalent to an EXE on Windows. Now let’s create and compile a “Hello, world!” program in C on Linux for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!");
}

$ gcc hello.c -o hello

$ ./hello 
Hello, world!

$ file hello
hello: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=480c7c75e09c169ab25d1b81bd28f66fde08da7c, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

$ du -sh hello
20K hello
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how much larger the file size is: 7 MB (Python) vs 20 KB (C)! This demonstrates the major drawback we discussed previously about file size and memory usage. The Python executable is so much larger due to the fact it must bundle the Python interpreter (as a shared object file on Linux) inside the executable itself in order to run.</p>
<h3>py2exe</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.py2exe.org/">Py2exe</a>&nbsp;is another popular method to convert Python code into Windows EXE (executable) format that can be run natively. Similar to PyInstaller, it bundles the Python interpreter with your Python code to make a portable executable. Py2exe is likely to fall out of style with time as it has not been supported past Python 3.4, this is due to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#cpython-bytecode-changes">the bytecode in CPython being heavily changed in Python 3.6 and beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Py2exe utilizes distutils and requires a small&nbsp;<code>setup.py</code>&nbsp;script to be created to produce an executable. Let’s create an example “Hello, world!” executable using py2exe:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; type hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

&gt; type setup.py
import py2exe
from distutils.core import setup
setup(
    console=['hello.py'],
    options={'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1, 'compressed': True}},
    zipfile=None
)

&gt; python setup.py py2exe
...

&gt; dist\hello.exe
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>hello.exe</code>&nbsp;created by py2exe is similar in size to PyInstaller coming in at 6.83 MB.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe.png" alt="" width="369" height="508" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe.png 369w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hello_exe-218x300.png 218w" sizes="(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px"></p>
<h3>Nuitka</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nuitka.png" alt="" width="120" height="24"></p>
<p><a href="https://nuitka.net/">Nuitka</a>&nbsp;is perhaps the most underutilized, and yet more advanced method of compiling Python code to an executable. It translates Python code into a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute code the same as CPython. Nuitka can use a variety of C compilers including gcc, clang, MinGW64, Visual Studio 2019+, and clang-cl to convert your Python code to C.</p>
<p>Let’s create a “Hello, world!” Python program on Linux and compile it using Nuitka:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py
print('Hello, world!')

$ nuitka3 hello.py
...

$ ./hello.bin
Hello, world!

$ file hello.bin 
hello.bin: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=eb6a504e8922f8983b23ce6e82c45a907c6ebadf, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

$ du -sh hello.bin
432K    hello.bin
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced a portable binary very simply, and at 432 KB is a fraction of the size of what PyInstaller or py2exe can produce! How is Nuitka able to do this? Let’s take a look at the build folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ cloc hello.build/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                     files          blank        comment           code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C                               11           2263            709           8109
C/C++ Header                     1              1              0              7
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUM:                            12           2264            709           8116
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>Nuitka produced over 8,000 lines of C code from our 1 line Python program. The way Nuitka works is it actually translates the Python modules into C code and then uses libpython and static C files of its own to execute in the same way as CPython does.</p>
<p>This is very impressive, and it seems highly likely the Nuitka “Python compiler” will see further adoption as time goes on. As we’ll see later, Nuitka might have a further, built-in advantage in protection against Reverse Engineering (RE). There already exist several tools to easily analyze binaries produced by PyInstaller and py2exe to recover Python source code. However, by Nuitka translating the Python code to C it is much more difficult to reverse engineer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tools.png" alt="" width="557" height="383" srcset="https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tools.png 557w, https://www.cyborgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tools-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px"></p>
<p>Python malware can take advantage of a massive ecosystem of open-source Python packages and repositories. Almost anything you could think of, someone has already built it using Python. This is a huge advantage to malware authors as simplistic capabilities can be cherry-picked from the open web and more complex capabilities likely don’t need to be written from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three simple, yet powerful tool examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code Obfuscation</li>
<li>Taking Screenshots</li>
<li>Performing Web Requests</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tool Example 1 – Obfuscation</h3>
<p>Malware authors using Python have many libraries they could use to obfuscate their Python code to make code readability much more difficult, such as:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/liftoff/pyminifier">pyminifier</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor">pyarmor</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how&nbsp;<code>pyarmor</code>&nbsp;can obfuscate Python code:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.py 
print('Hello, world!')

$ pyarmor obfuscate hello.py
...

$ cat dist/hello.py
from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime
pyarmor_runtime()
__pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x50\x59\x41\x52\x4d\x4f\x52\x00\x00\x03\x08\x00\x55\x0d\x0d\x0a\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x40\x00\x00\x00\xd5\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x18\xf4\x63\x79\xf6\xaa\xd7\xbd\xc8\x85\x25\x4e\x4f\xa6\x80\x72\x9f\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xec\x50\x8c\x64\x26\x42\xd6\x01\x10\x54\xca\x9c\xb6\x30\x82\x05\xb8\x63\x3f\xb0\x96\xb1\x97\x0b\xc1\x49\xc9\x47\x86\x55\x61\x93\x75\xa2\xc2\x8c\xb7\x13\x87\xff\x31\x46\xa5\x29\x41\x9d\xdf\x32\xed\x7a\xb9\xa0\xe1\x9a\x50\x4a\x65\x25\xdb\xbe\x1b\xb6\xcd\xd4\xe7\xc2\x97\x35\xd3\x3e\xd3\xd0\x74\xb8\xd5\xab\x48\xd3\x05\x29\x5e\x31\xcf\x3f\xd3\x51\x78\x13\xbc\xb3\x3e\x63\x62\xca\x05\xfb\xac\xed\xfa\xc1\xe3\xb8\xa2\xaa\xfb\xaa\xbb\xb5\x92\x19\x73\xf0\x78\xe4\x9f\xb0\x1c\x7a\x1c\x0c\x6a\xa7\x8b\x19\x38\x37\x7f\x16\xe8\x61\x41\x68\xef\x6a\x96\x3f\x68\x2b\xb7\xec\x60\x39\x51\xa3\xfc\xbd\x65\xdb\xb8\xff\x39\xfe\xc0\x3d\x16\x51\x7f\xc9\x7f\x8b\xbd\x88\x80\x92\xfe\xe1\x23\x61\xd0\xf1\xd3\xf8\xfa\xce\x86\x92\x6d\x4d\xd7\x69\x50\x8b\xf1\x09\x31\xcc\x19\x15\xef\x37\x12\xd4\xbd\x3d\x0d\x6e\xbb\x28\x3e\xac\xbb\xc4\xdb\x98\xb5\x85\xa6\x19\x11\x74\xe9\xab\xdf', 1)

  <article>
  
  <p>Jul 13, 2020</p>
  <p>As many web platform developer and Firefox users, I believe <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla’s mission</a> is instrumental for a better Internet. In a recent <a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/ecosystem-health">Igalia’s chat about the Web Ecosystem Health</a>, participants made the usual observation regarding this important role played by Mozilla on the one hand and the limited development resources and small Firefox’s usage share on the other hand. In this blog post, I’d like to explain an experimental idea we are launching at Igalia to try and make browser development better match the interest of the web developer and user community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">
    <img src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/open-prioritization.png" width="750" height="255" alt="Open Prioritization by Igalia. An experiment in crowd-funding prioritization.">
  </a>
</p>

<h2 id="igalias-contribution-to-browser-repositories">Igalia’s contribution to browser repositories</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the past in this blog, Igalia has contributed to different part of Firefox such as multimedia (e.g. &lt;video&gt; support), layout (e.g. Stylo, WebRender, CSS, MathML), scripts (e.g. BigInt, WebAssembly) or accessibility (e.g. ARIA). But is it enough?</p>

<p>Although commit count is an imperfect metric it is also one of the easiest to obtain. Let’s take a look at how Igalia’s commits repositories of the Chromium (chromium, v8), Mozilla (mozilla-central, servo, servo-web-render) and WebKit projects were distributed last year:</p>

<figure>
  <img width="374" height="305" src="http://frederic-wang.fr/images/distribution-of-igalia-commits-2019.png" alt="pie chart">
  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, the distribution of Igalia's contributions to browser repositories in 2019 (~5200 commits). Chromium (~73%), Mozilla (~4%) and WebKit (~23%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, in absolute value Igalia contributed roughly 3/4 to Chromium, 1/4 to WebKit, with a small remaining amount to Mozilla. This is not surprising since Igalia is a consulting company and our work depends on the importance of browsers in the market where Chromium dominates and WebKit is also quite good for iOS devices and embedded systems.</p>

<p>This suggests a different way to measure our contribution by considering, for each project, the percentage relative to the total amount of commits:</p>

<figure>

  <figcaption><small>Diagram showing, for each project, the percentage of Igalia's commits in 2019 relative to the total amount of the project. From left to right:
  Chromium (~3.96%), Mozilla (~0.43%) and WebKit (~10.92%).</small>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the WebKit project, where ~80% of the contributions were made by Apple, Igalia was second with ~10% of the total. In the Chromium project, the huge Google team made more than 90% of the contributions and many more companies are involved, but Igalia was second with about 4% of the total. In the Mozilla project, Mozilla is also doing ~90% of the contributions but Igalia only had ~0.5% of the total. Interestingly, the second contributing organization was… the community of unindentified gmail.com addresses! Of course, this shows the importance of volunteers in the Mozilla project where a great effort is done to encourage participation.</p>

<h2 id="open-prioritization">Open Prioritization</h2>

<p>From the commit count, it’s clear Igalia is not contributing as much to the Mozilla project as to Chromium or WebKit projects. But this is expected and is just reflecting the priority set by large companies. The solid base of Firefox users as well as the large amount of volunteer contributors show that the Mozilla project is nevertheless still attractive for many people. Could we turn this into browser development that is not funded by advertising or selling devices?</p>

<p>Another related question is whether the internet can really be shaped by the global community as defended by the Mozilla’s mission? Is the web doomed to be controlled by big corporations doing technology’s “evangelism” or lobbying at standardization committees? Are there prioritization issues that can be addressed by moving to a more collective decision process?</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.igalia.com/about/">Igalia</a>, we internally try and follow <a href="https://wingolog.org/tags/cooperatives">a more democratic organization</a> and, at our level, intend to make the world a better place. Today, we are launching a new <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/">Open Prioritization</a> experiment to verify whether crowdfunding could be a way to influence how browser development is prioritized. Below is a short (5 min) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk">introductory video</a>:</p>

<iframe width="850" height="508" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I strongly recommend you to take a look at the proposed projects and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/open-prioritization/#faq">read the FAQ</a> to understand how this is going to work. But remember <em>this is an experiment</em> so we are starting with a few ideas that we selected and tasks that are relatively small. We know there are tons of user reports in bug trackers and suggestions of standards, but we are not going to solve everything in one day !</p>

<p>If the process is successful, we can consider generalizing this approach, but we need to test it first, check what works and what doesn’t, consider whether it is worth pursuing, analyze how it can be improved, etc</p>

<h2 id="two-crowdfunding-tasks-for-firefox">Two Crowdfunding Tasks for Firefox</h2>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As explained in the previous paragraph, we are starting with small tasks. For Firefox, we selected the following ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CSS <code>lab()</code> colors. This is about giving web developers a way to express colors using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space">CIELAB color space</a> which approximates better the human perception. My colleague Brian Kardell wrote a <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Unlocking-Colors.html">blog with more details</a>. Some investigations have been made by <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=205675">Apple</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1026287">Google</a>. Let’s see what we can do for Firefox !</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SVG path <code>d</code> attribute. This is about expressing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1571119">SVG path using the corresponding CSS syntax</a> for example <code>&lt;path style="d: path('M0,0 L10,10,...')"&gt;</code>. This will likely involve a refactoring to use the same parser for both SVG and CSS paths. It’s a small feature but part of a more general <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d--S_wgAJA">convergence effort between SVG and CSS</a> that Igalia has been involved in.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Is this crowd-funded experiment going to work? Can this approach solve the prioritization problems or at least help a bit? How can we improve that idea in the future?…</p>

<p>There are many open questions but we will only be able to answer them if we have enough people participating. I’ll personally pledge for the two Firefox projects and I invite you to at least take a look and decide whether there is something there that is interesting for you. Let’s try and see!</p>

Recently, it became hot again. In this post, I’d like to do a quick recap to set the stage. Then, I’ll analyze reasons for license changes.</p> <div> <h2 id="the-rise-of-open-source">The rise of Open Source</h2> <div> <p>Before I actually started my career - even I was before even born - software was provided with its source code. The value was in the hardware. Most customers - if not every one of them - modified and adapted the source code to their hardware. Then, in 1969, the United States' government ruled (against IBM) that the bundling of software and hardware together was <em>anticompetitive</em>. The value moved from hardware to software because of an unexpected side-effect of the previous ruling. Thus began the rise of Microsoft Windows. Interestingly enough, that also changed the way software was delivered. Customers only got the binaries, not the source code. Of course, this is mostly the case today.</p> <p>Around ten years later, a new trend started in reaction to that: some with Richard Stallman decided that releasing the source code was the only <em>right</em> way to deliver software. Furthermore, their position was that software should be free. Because that tiny initiative became a respectable model, this view on things is more than relevant today. Today, Open Source means different things in the mind of different people.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="open-source-is-a-loaded-term">Open Source is a loaded term</h2> <div> <p>Literally, Open Source is only the delivery of the source code along the binary. No more, no less. For commercial software, if carefully worded in the purchasing contract, that means that the customer should be able to maintain the software if the vendor doesn’t anymore (<em>e.g.</em> goes bankrupt). Yet, according to Stallman’s definition, software needs to be free:</p> <div> <blockquote> <ul><li><span>Free as a bird</span></li><li><span>Free as a beer</span></li></ul> </blockquote> </div> <p>To avoid any confusion, I’d rather use the expression Free Open-Source Software <em>a.k.a.</em> FOSS.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="what-qualifies-as-open-source">What qualifies as Open Source</h2> <div> <p>This gap in the terms were deeply materialized in tensions in the community between tenants of the business-compatible Open Source and FOSS as defined above. From the former group was born the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Initiative</a>. The importance of this organization cannot be understated: it decides what licenses are considered Open Source, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition">Open Source definition</a>. Criteria are:</p> <ol><li><span>Free Redistribution</span></li><li><span>Source Code</span></li><li><span>Derived Works</span></li><li><span>Integrity of The Author’s Source Code</span></li><li><span>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</span></li><li><span>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</span></li><li><span>Distribution of License</span></li><li><span>License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</span></li><li><span>License Must Not Restrict Other Software</span></li><li><span>License Must Be Technology-Neutral</span></li></ol> <p>As of the time of writing of this post, licenses that are allowed to be qualified as Open Source are <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited in number</a>. Here’s a couple of them:</p> <ul><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT license</a></span></li></ul> <p>Here are two counter-examples:</p> <ul><li><span>The <a href="https://github.com/climate-strike/license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Strike License</a> is not Open Source, as it’s not in the list above</span></li><li><span><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</a> are not Open Source, as they don’t apply to software only</span></li></ul> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="monetizing-open-source">Monetizing Open Source</h2> <div> <p>Open Source began as a community of like-minded people who wanted to create something together, and were willing to put on the extra effort, after office hours. However, today, the main contributors on the main projects are paid by private companies: they code during office hours. The reason for that is that Open Source - not FOSS - is compatible with business.</p> <p>There are a couple of ways to monetize Open Source software:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Training and consulting</dt> <dd> <p>If you provide a great software, companies will start using it. At some point, there are chances they will need consulting, for advanced usage. After that, they will also need training to level up their workforce. It has been the traditional way to make money with Open Source. Unfortunately, this doesn’t scale.</p> </dd> <dt>Support</dt> <dd> <p>While consulting is planned, support comes in handy when the sh…​ has already hit the fan. Picture this: it’s 10PM, the monitoring Open Source stack your company uses has crashed, and refuse to start again. One definitely needs support in this case. <em>In general</em>, managers don’t like to use any kind of software - whether FOSS, Open Source or something else - if they don’t have an associated support contract.</p> </dd> <dt>Open Source core</dt> <dd> <p>The software offers features that are Open Source. A set of features available via extensions/plugins operate under a commercial (<em>i.e.</em> paying) license. The respective size of each depends on one’s strategy. The more features in the Open Source part, the more people will use it, but the less money one will get. This is a fine balance to find.</p> </dd> <dt>Dual license</dt> <dd> <p>The software is available under two different licenses, one Open Source, the other commercial. When one uses the software, one needs to choose which license should apply. For this model to work, and companies to decide to pay a license fee, the Open Source license should be a deterrent. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNU General Public License</a> is a solid choice: it mandates that software that embeds the GPL software should be released under the GPL license itself <em>i.e.</em> for free.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="service-wrapping">Service-wrapping</h2> <div> <p>It’s no mystery that "the Cloud" has become ubiquitous since a couple of years, whether you like it or not. As more companies moved their IT-systems to the Cloud, the Cloud service providers became a force to be reckoned with. With that power, they bargained with software vendors on ways to provide the latter’s software on their infrastructure. In general, the deal was pretty much one-sided: Cloud providers got a larger portfolio of services, while software vendors got "free advertisement" for their software, and in the best of case, crumbs of the revenue.</p> <p>But even that was not enough. Some cloud providers became so bold as to stop pretending it was even a deal. They just got they greedy hands on the Open Source software, and service-wrapped it. It was completely legal, as none of the licenses prevents that. However, it raises the question of revenue sharing: one company is paying to develop the software, while another company is getting the biggest share of the revenues, because it controls the marketplace.</p> <p>Because of that, some software vendors decided to change their license to prevent service wrapping. The issue is that no Open Source license is able to achieve that. Hence, those new licenses are not considered Open Source, as per the Open Source Initiative definition.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-license-changes">Other license changes</h2> <div> <p>Changing one’s license is in general not a great idea. When somebody uses your software, they need to be able to trust they can use it in the future under the same terms. The anti-service wrapping changes made sure that was the case.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, I saw recently a license change unrelated to service wrapping. In the light of the CoVid-19 pandemics, somebody thought it would be a good idea to change the license to a new one:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>CoronaVirus License :</p> <p>The coronavirus is coming to you. It’s coming at an exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly. It’s a matter of days. Maybe a week or two. When it does, your healthcare system will be overwhelmed. Your fellow citizens will be treated in the hallways. Exhausted healthcare workers will break down. Some will die. They will have to decide which patient gets the oxygen and which one dies. The only way to prevent this is social distancing today. Not tomorrow. Today. That means keeping as many people home as possible, starting now.</p> <p>To use this program, you must</p>  <p>2) Apply social distancing</p> <p>If you live in UK, Europe, North &amp; South America, Iran, Japan, Korea…​ and if you refuse to do so, please uninstall Dummy from your system and do not use this service anymore.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>While the intention behind this change was commendable, the change was not. This is a sure sign the license cannot be trusted. If it changes today, why cannot it change tomorrow, for other reasons? I’d advise everybody in this situation not to do that.</p> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Important"></i> </td> <td> The license change was rollbacked as it was considered at least partially unlawful. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <div> <p>In this post, we described the origin of Open Source Software. We looked at the semantics of the expression "Open Source", and described the difference with <abbr title="Free Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr>. Then, we wrote about the Open Source Initiative, the characteristics it applies to define Open Source, and some licenses that fit this definition. We proceeded to list some ways on how to monetize FOSS. Finally, we described the problematic behavior of some Cloud providers, and how changing the license is a way to avoid it. Other reasons for license changes might break the contrast of trust between a software vendor and its users.</p> </div> </div>    </div> </section>   </article> </div> </div></div>]]>

						Introduction</p><p>
						
						
						&nbsp;
						
						I owe my interest in public education to Everett Reimer. Until we first met in Puerto Rico in 1958, I had never questioned the value of extending obligatory schooling to all people. Together we have come to realize that for most men the right to learn is curtailed by the obligation to attend school. The essays given at CIDOC and gathered in this book grew out of memoranda which I submitted to him, and which we discussed during 1970, the thirteenth year of our dialogue. The last chapter contains my afterthoughts on a conversation with Erich Fromm on Bachofen's Mutterrecht.</p><p>
						
						
						Since 1967 Reimer and I have met regularly at the Center for Intercultural Documentation (CIDOC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Valentine Borremans, the director of the Center, also joined our dialogue, and constantly urged me to test our thinking against the realities of Latin America and Africa. This book reflects her conviction that the ethos, not just the institutions, of society ought to be "deschooled."</p><p>
						
						
						Universal education through schooling is not feasible. It would be no more feasible if it were attempted by means of alternative institutions built on the style of present schools. Neither new attitudes of teachers toward their pupils nor the proliferation of educational hardware or software (in classroom or bedroom), nor finally the attempt to expand the pedagogue's responsibility until it engulfs his pupils' lifetimes will deliver universal education. The current search for new educational funnels must be reversed into the search for their institutional inverse: educational webs which heighten the opportunity for each one to transform each moment of his living into one of learning, sharing, and caring. We hope to contribute concepts needed by those who conduct such counterfoil research on education--and also to those who seek alternatives to other established service industries.</p><p>
						
						
						On Wednesday mornings, during the spring and summer of 1970, I submitted the various parts of this book to the participants in our CIDOC programs in Cuernavaca. Dozens of them made suggestions or provided criticisms. Many will recognize their ideas in these pages, especially Paulo Freire, Peter Berger, and Jos? Maria Bulnes, as well as Joseph Fitzpatrick, John Holt, Angel Quintero, Layman Allen, Fred Goodman, Gerhard Ladner, Didier Piveteau, Joel Spring, Augusto Salazar Bondy, and Dennis Sullivan. Among my critics, Paul Goodman most radically obliged me to revise my thinking. Robert Silvers provided me with brilliant editorial assistance on Chapters 1, 3, and 6, which have appeared in The New York Review of Books.</p><p>
						
						
						Reimer and I have decided to publish separate views of our joint research. He is working on a comprehensive and documented exposition, which will be subjected to several months of further critical appraisal and be published late in 1971 by Doubleday &amp; Company. Dennis Sullivan, who acted as secretary at the meetings between Reimer and myself, is preparing a book for publication in the spring of 1972 which will place my argument in the context of current debate about public schooling in the United States. I offer this volume of essays now in the hope that it will provoke additional critical contributions to the sessions of a seminar on "Alternatives in Education" planned at CIDOC in Cuernavaca for 1972 and 1973.</p><p>
						
						
						I intend to discuss some perplexing issues which are raised once we embrace the hypothesis that society can be deschooled; to search for criteria which may help us distinguish institutions which merit development because they support learning in a deschooled milieu; and to clarify those personal goals which would foster the advent of an Age of Leisure (schole) as opposed to an economy dominated by service industries. </p><p>

						&nbsp;
						
						
						Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation leads to success. The pupil is thereby "schooled" to confuse teaching with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His imagination is "schooled" to accept service in place of value. Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor are defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, and other agencies in question.</p><p>
						
						
						In these essays, I will show that the institutionalization of values leads inevitably to physical pollution, social polarization, and psychological impotence: three dimensions in a process of global degradation and modernized misery. I will explain how this process of degradation is accelerated when nonmaterial needs are transformed into demands for commodities; when health, education, personal mobility, welfare, or psychological healing are defined as the result of services or "treatments." I do this because I believe that most of the research now going on about the future tends to advocate further increases in the institutionalization of values and that we must define conditions which would permit precisely the contrary to happen. We need research on the possible use of technology to create institutions which serve personal, creative, and autonomous interaction and the emergence of values which cannot be substantially controlled by technocrats. We need counterfoil research to current futurology.</p><p>
						
						
						I want to raise the general question of the mutual definition of man's nature and the nature of modern institutions which characterizes our world view and language. To do so, I have chosen the school as my paradigm, and I therefore deal only indirectly with other bureaucratic agencies of the corporate state: the consumer-family, the party, the army, the church, the media. My analysis of the hidden curriculum of school should make it evident that public education would profit from the deschooling of society, just as family life, politics, security, faith, and communication would profit from an analogous process.</p><p>
						
						
						I begin my analysis, in this first essay, by trying to convey what the deschooling of a schooled society might mean. In this context, it should be easier to understand my choice of the five specific aspects relevant to this process with which I deal in the subsequent chapters.</p><p>
						
						
						Not only education but social reality itself has become schooled. It costs roughly the same to school both rich and poor in the same dependency. The yearly expenditure per pupil in the slums and in the rich suburbs of any one of twenty U.S. cities lies in the same range-and sometimes is favorable to the poor. Rich and poor alike depend on schools and hospitals which guide their lives, form their world view, and define for them what is legitimate and what is not. Both view doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one's own as unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those in authority, as a form of aggression or subversion. For both groups the reliance on institutional treatment renders independent accomplishment suspect. The progressive underdevelopment of self- and community-reliance is even more typical in Westchester than it is in the northeast of Brazil. Everywhere not only education but society as a whole needs "deschooling."</p><p>
						
						
						Welfare bureaucracies claim a professional, political, and financial monopoly over the social imagination, setting standards of what is valuable and what is feasible. This monopoly is at the root of the modernization of poverty. Every simple need to which an institutional answer is found permits the invention of a new class of poor and a new definition of poverty. Ten years ago in Mexico it was the normal thing to be born and to die in one's own home and to be buried by one's friends. Only the soul's needs were taken care of by the institutional church. Now to begin andend life at home become signs either of poverty or of special privilege. Dying and death have come under the institutional management of doctors and undertakers.</p><p>
						
						
						Once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change at will. Poverty then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of consumption in some important respect. In Mexico the poor are those who lack three years of schooling, and in New York they are those who lack twelve.</p><p>
						
						
						The poor have always been socially powerless. The increasing reliance on institutional care adds a new dimension to their helplessness: psychological …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<center><em>TypeScript — ARM  — August 2020</em></center>

<p><big><em>So, you’ve been trying to learn how compilers and programming languages work?</em> </big></p>

<p>Perhaps, you’ve learned about compiling to JavaScript,
or about building an interpreter? Or, maybe, about
compiling to bytecode? All good steps.</p>

<p><em>But there’s a tension building up.</em></p>

<p>Because it feels a bit like cheating.
Because you know that somewhere, somehow, the code you write
is translated to assembly instructions. To the machine language.
That’s where the rubber hits the road. That’s where it gets hot.
And, oh-so-many resources are hesitant to cover this part.
But not this book.</p>

<p>This ebook will show you in detail
how you can build a compiler from scratch
that goes all the way from <em>source</em> to <em>assembly</em>.</p>

<p>The example code is written in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, a dialect of <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
The book describes the design and implementation of a compiler that emits
32-bit <strong>ARM</strong> assembly instructions.</p>

<h2>Why ARM?</h2>

<p>In many ways, the ARM instruction set is what makes this book possible.</p>

<p>Compared to Intel x86-64, the ARM instruction set is a work of art.</p>

<p>Intel x86-64 is the result of evolution from an 8-bit processor,
to a 16-bit one, then to a 32-bit one, and finally to a 64-bit one.
At each step of the evolution, it accumulated complexity and cruft.
At each step, it tried to satisfy conflicting requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel x86-64 is based on <em>Complex Instruction Set Architecture</em> (CISC),
which was initially optimized for writing assembly by hand.</li>
<li>ARM, on the other hand, is based on <em>Reduced Instruction Set Architecture</em> (RISC),
which is optimized for writing compilers.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Guess which one is an easier target for a compiler?</em></p>

<p>If this book targeted Intel x86-64 instead of ARM, it would have been two times as long
and — more likely — never written.
Also, with 160 <em>billion</em> devices shipped, we better get used to the fact
that ARM is the dominant instruction set architecture today.</p>

<p>In other words… ARM is a good start.
After learning it, you will be better equipped
for moving to x86-64 or the new ARM64.</p>

<p><em>Will you be able to run the code your compiler produces?</em></p>

<p>I bet you will! The Appendix will contain a bazillion ways
to execute ARM code, starting from Raspberry Pi,
cloud VM, to various ways to emulate ARM on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>

<h2>Why TypeScript?</h2>

<p>First of all, you will be able to follow this book in any reasonable programming language.
For me, it was tough to pick one for this job, and I’m pleased I’ve chosen TypeScript.</p>

<p>TypeScript is probably nobody’s favorite, but it’s a good compromise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you coming from a dynamic language like JavaScript, Python, or Ruby?
Then if you close your eyes at the
type annotations, TypeScript is just modern-day JavaScript.</li>
<li>If you’re coming from Java or C#, then you will feel right at home,
since TypeScript
is brought to you by the same people who brought you C# <em>(and Turbo Pascal!)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t worry if you’ve never seen TypeScript code before.
If you can read the following, you will most likely be able to pick it up,
as the book goes <em>(real code from the book here!)</em>:</p>

<pre><b>class </b>Label {
  <b>static </b>counter = 0;
  value: number; <em>// Type annotation
</em>
  <b>constructor</b>() {
    <b>this</b>.value = Label.counter++;
  }

  toString() {
    <b>return </b>'.L' + <b>this</b>.value;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>I avoided using any TypeScript- or JavaScript-specific
language features in the code.</p>

<p>If you’re into statically-typed functional programming
languages (Haskell, OCaml, or Reason ML),
you will find that the class structure I used
has a nice translation to an algebraic data type.
It is, in fact, how I wrote it first.</p>



<h2>Book Contents</h2>

<p>The book consists of two parts. Part I
presents a <em>detailed</em>, <em>step-by-step</em> guide on how
to develop a small “baseline” compiler that can compile simple
programs to ARM assembly.</p>

<p>By the end of Part I, you will have a working compiler that can
compile simple functions like this one:</p>

<!--table>
<tr>
<td>


md5-73395652867122248e3299aa94c98c61


</td>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
</table-->

<pre><b>function </b>factorial(n) {
  <b>if </b>(n == 0) {
    <b>return </b>1;
  } <b>else </b>{
    <b>return </b>n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Into ARM assembly code like this:</p>

<pre>.global factorial
factorial:
  <b>push </b>{fp, lr}
  <b>mov </b>fp, sp
  <b>push </b>{r0, r1}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =0
  <b>push </b>{r0, ip}
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>pop </b>{r1, ip}
  <b>cmp </b>r0, r1
  <b>moveq </b>r0, #1
  <b>movne </b>r0, #0
  <b>cmp </b>r0, #0
  <b>beq </b>.L1
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>b </b>.L2
.L1:
  <b>ldr </b>r0, =1
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>sub </b>r0, r0, r1
  <b>bl </b>factorial
  <b>mov </b>r1, r0
  <b>ldr </b>r0, [fp, #-8]
  <b>mul </b>r0, r0, r1
.L2:
  <b>mov </b>sp, fp
  <b>pop </b>{fp, pc}
</pre>

<p>This code won’t win any awards, and an optimizing compiler
could do much better, but it’s a start!</p>

<p>Part II talks about <em>more advanced</em> topics in <em>less details</em>.
It explores several different (often mutually exclusive)
directions in which you can take your compiler.</p>

When I write blog posts I usually spent the first half
of the time writing the code and develoing the idea, and
the second half on the prose.
This book will be no exception.

At the moment I have finished writing
the code, and I am very happy with the results.
I expect the book to be ready early summer 2020, and a draft to
be available even sooner.

            <p>At the end of June, I launched a business-focused extension to my open-source project. <a href="https://tenancyforlaravel.com/saas-boilerplate/">The multi-tenant SaaS boilerplate for Laravel</a>.</p>

<p>The sales completely exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>$4,980 within the first 24 hours and $11,673 within the first 5 days.</p>

<p>🤯</p>

<p>Here’s the story leading to this.</p>

<h2>Story of the project</h2>

<p>Exactly 2 years ago (June 2018), I was 16 and I decided to start building my first SaaS application. It was meant to be an e-commerce platform focused on B2B sales.</p>

<p>After working on the project for 9 months, I needed to implement <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/what-is-multi-tenancy-why-you-might-need-it-8a0d64f161">multi-tenancy</a>. I looked at the existing solutions (Laravel packages) and they all felt extremely confusing and complex.</p>

<p>I decided to do the naive thing and write my own package. See, I wasn’t very experienced with Laravel at this point. I’ve only been using it since around July 2018. And this was at the beginning of 2019.</p>

<p>The main thing that I disliked about the existing solutions was that they pretty much required that you rebuild your entire application around their package.</p>

<p>That felt horrifying to me — again, I wasn’t a very experienced developer.</p>

<p>I felt like there should be a solution that just works with an existing application. The basic idea of multi-tenancy is letting customers have separate databases. Why would I have to rewrite my entire application for this? Why can’t I just tell the app to use database X after identifying the customer?</p>

<h3>Version 1</h3>

<p>I released v1 of the package in February. It was limited in features, but it fulfilled my needs. I didn’t have to rewrite my app anymore.</p>

<p>The package didn’t get much traction at this point.</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-v1.png" alt="The star count for version 1"></p>

<p>On February 17, it got the first star on GitHub. 3 months later, it only had 60 stars.</p>

<p>And my SaaS wasn’t succeeding either. I decided to abandon the project basically immediately after I wrote the multi-tenancy package. I realized how bad the code was. The product market fit was there, but I didn’t want to work on this codebase anymore.</p>

<p>I started some other projects instead. They of course got abandoned too, after a few months. Such is the life of SaaS.</p>

<h3>Version 2</h3>

<p>In July, I decided to double down on the package. I started working on version 2. It added a lot more features and made it less proof-of-concept-y and more production ready. Fulfilled more business needs.</p>

<p>In August, I created a landing page for the project. I started <strong>treating it more as a product</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wp.laravel-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stancl-tenancy.jpg?fit=2220%2C1125&amp;ssl=1?resize=2200%2C1125" alt="The first landing page">
<small>The first landing page.</small></p>

<p>By the end of August, the project had some 216 stars.</p>

<p>I doubled down on the marketing side of things, got some articles written and by the end of October, the project was at 476 stars.</p>

<h3>Burnout</h3>

<p>At this point, I took a hiatus from the project. I was juggling multiple projects at once and was starting to get severely burnt out.</p>

<p>For the following two months, I got basically zero work done. On any projects. This was the darkest time for me, work and focus-wise.</p>

<p>There’s a positive side to it, though. Experiencing a strong burnout for a manageable period of time is good — if you analyze it well. Teaches you what <strong>not</strong> to do and how much it sucks to be burnt out. After an experience like that, you’ll focus very hard on not getting burnt out.</p>

<p><img src="https://builtwithtailwind.s3.amazonaws.com/237/conversions/tenancy.samuelstancl.me_-featured.jpg" alt="The second landing page">
<small>I finished this period of focusing on the package with a second, better-designed landing page.</small></p>

<h3>The lockdown</h3>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic was a blessing in disguise when it comes to side projects.</p>

<p>Instead of school, I got to stay at home.</p>

<p>In the past few months I didn’t do much work. So working now was actually refreshing!</p>

<p>The timing really couldn’t have been any better. School got closed first week of March. About 2 weeks after I could (and did) legally get my sole proprietor license.</p>

<p>I took on a bit of client work, started making a bit of $ from that, but mostly <strong>I again focused on the package</strong>.</p>

<p>There were some quirks I didn’t like about the architecture of the code. I also didn’t like that the package was making an impression of being too opinionated and not enterprise™ enough.</p>

<p>So I focused on fixing exactly that.</p>

<p>I contacted a person who was interested in me adding some more enterprise-y features back in October. I explained that I’m focusing on the package again and that I’d like to add a lot of things to it.</p>

<p>He was very glad to hear this. We talked for a while and he offered <strong>sponsoring me to add specific features to the open-source package</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me know if €5,000 is a good price for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was huge.</p>

<p>See, the project was released in February 2019. And there were <strong>no donations whatsoever</strong> until October.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSJCo55YgQmuVaJCuyfsKmSs23UIemGD3g198A5fvYhSQeMdzBI7NA7z9NEx0VwbNSEYdj_N4uZEsBx/pubchart?oid=1707722928&amp;format=image" alt="Donations between launch (February 2019 and March 2020)"></p>

<p>And even until March, the donations totaled $111.</p>

<p>5,000 EUR felt massive.</p>

<p>This was at the end of April.</p>

<p>I accepted the offer, expressed great gratitude and got to work.</p>

<p>I decided to focus <strong>FULLY</strong> on the package.</p>

<p>I was writing code and documentation all <strike>days</strike> nights long. Quarantine did its thing on my sleep schedule, but I was happy. Got a ton of work done.</p>

<p>Woke up at 16:00, went to bed at 8:00. Every day.</p>

<p>On May 13th (about 2-3 weeks after the donation) I announced a closed beta.</p>

<p>Why closed? Continue reading.</p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Like I said, there were other packages.</p>

<p>The project that made me create my own package also had a sister package. It was in development for seemingly forever.</p>

<p>However, in May, Spatie — a web development agency that’s very famous in the Laravel world for their open-source work — started writing their own multi-tenancy package.</p>

<p>This made the other project hurry development too. So in May, these packages were being released:</p>

<ul>
<li>My package’s version 3</li>
<li>Spatie’s new package</li>
<li>tenancy.dev’s new package</li>
</ul>

<p>This got stressful fast.</p>

<p>The Spatie package was built on the same principles as my package. Automatic, no changes needed. Except it was a lot simpler version.</p>

<p>That was no good!</p>

<p>Also remember when I said that I was trying to focus my package more on the enterprise-y needs, like flexibility? That’s what the tenancy.dev package is about, to a large degree.</p>

<p>Hence the closed beta. I ain’t showing no code to competition!</p>

<p><img src="https://samuelstancl.me/assets/img/tenancy-stars-comparison.svg" alt="Comparison of GitHub stars between the packages">
<small>The evolution of GitHub stars — <span>blue</span> is my package, <span>green</span> is the older competing package, <span>yellow</span> is Spatie's new package.</small></p>

<h3>The boilerplate</h3>

<p>With the beta done, it was time to focus on the commercial product.</p>

<p>The idea was this: Even though the package does all the heavy lifting for you, you still need to implement it. And many apps will implement it in the same way.</p>

<p>So there was a place for another project. A boilerplate with all the stuff you’d be writing anyway. This means customer (tenant) onboarding flow, billing logic, an admin panel, domain management, customer HTTPS certificate management etc.</p>

<p>And it also fit perfectly into my beta. I had a beta that I wanted users to test. I also wanted to build an app that would use the package. This would make me see all the missing parts, from the perspective of a <strong>user</strong> of the package.</p>

<p>This took about a month of half-work to build.</p>

<p>Why half-work? Motivation was slowly disappearing, the beta &amp; new marketing website was out, so competition was sort of taken care of. Also a bunch of personal stuff happening.</p>

<h2>The launch</h2>

<p>I was on a family vacation in Southern Europe. I originally wanted to finish all my work before going there, but you know how IT projects are.</p>

<p>I spent the first week doing fun stuff — working out, walking, reading, listening to audiobooks and podcasts.</p>

<p>But after a week of spending my time completely differently than I normally do, I decided to finish the work. So, I spent 3 days inside the apartment. There was no time to go outside, I <strong>had</strong> to finish this.</p>

<p>I was finishing the package’s features alongside the boilerplate.</p>

<p>The package was ready for release. And so was the boilerplate.</p>

<p>This was at <strong>3 AM in the morning</strong>. I was severely overworked and it was time to write an announcement.</p>

<p>I didn’t have enough energy to send an email, do a Twitter thread, make a launch discount or any of the other stuff. Nor did I have the confidence in my abilities to do it well at 3 AM.</p>

<p>But I was glad I managed to get the marketing site done! In some form anyway.</p>

<p>So I went with a <strong>safer approach</strong>. I announced the release on my Discord server. This way only a small portion of my users saw it and if anything was wrong, I’d manage to extinguish the fire before it got too big.</p>

<p>So I made an announcement and went to bed. I didn’t expect much. I actually <strong>don’t know</strong> what I expected.</p>

<p>But I can say that <strong>waking up to $600 in sales surprised me</strong>.</p>

<p>I woke up, went to the bathroom, and went straight to the computer. Inviting people who bought the project to the private community (no automated process — gotta do that MVP!). Improving the marketing page.</p>

<p>Then I got to scheduling a <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelstancl/status/1277920614670577672">Twitter thread</a> on Hypefury and writing a marketing email on Mailchimp.</p>

<p>Then both went out.</p>

<p>And the sales started coming in.</p>

<p>A lot of them.</p>

<p>A <strong>LOT</strong> of them.</p>

<p>My inbox quickly got filled with tens of emails with the subject line of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New sale of Multi-tenant SaaS boilerplate for Laravel - Standard version</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SaBSah1.png" alt="https://i.imgur.com/SaBSah1.png"></p>

<p>I was incredibly happy.</p>

<p>The first day concluded with a bit over $5000 in sales.</p>

<h2>The selling process</h2>

<p>The product was sold in two tiers. Standard and Enterprise.</p>

<p>The difference between the two versions was that the Enterprise version got priority support and could be used by companies with an annual revenue of $60k and higher. This is the same model <a href="http://nova.laravel.com/">Laravel Nova</a> uses.</p>

<p>I launched the product with <strong>two launch discounts</strong>.</p>

<p>A “generic” one, that I haven’t yet decided when it will end.</p>

<p>And a better one, that <strong>only lasted the first 48 hours</strong>.</p>

<p>The prices were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard: $299 -&gt; $199 (generic) -&gt; <strong>$149 (48 hour)</strong></li>
<li>Enterprise: $499 -&gt; $379 (generic) -&gt; <strong>$349 (48 hour)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I think given the sales, I hit the nail on the head with the pricing.</p>

<p>It was pretty affordable for solo projects, while also being high enough for the enterprise version.</p>

<p>My project is in this strange space where there are one-man indie hacker projects on one side of the income spectrum, and huge enterprises on the other side of the spectrum. Very little in between.</p>

                We are not prisoners of groupthink.
            </a>
        </h2>
        <h3>How I stopped worrying about "cancel culture" with this one weird tip.</h3>
        
        <p><em>This is a response to the Gareth Roberts essay titled
<a href="https://unherd.com/2020/07/why-the-prisoner-is-more-accurate-than-orwell/">"We are all prisoners of groupthink".</a></em></p>
<p>A common theme on the Internet is selection bias. We seek out content and
interactions that fit our sensibilities, beliefs and emotional disposition.
Social networks have exploited this tendency, drawing us into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a> where we are
algorithmically bombarded with content designed to maximize our "engagement"
with no regard to damage done in terms of our psychological well-being or
intellectual isolation. This makes us better consumers, but reinforces
divisions between individuals and poisons any possibility of meaningful
discourse, instead favoring shit-flinging competitions between so-called
<a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1261126114799468549?lang=en">"keyboard warriors."</a>
This is well-documented, the social media companies are aware of it,
and they don't care because <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499">division makes money.</a></p>
<p>Our filter bubbles are designed to comfort and placate us while we're force-fed
promoted content and offers and idealized imagery. Our collective ability
to think critically has been siphoned away; anything that remotely challenges
our beliefs is seen as a threat or an attack. Over time this has lead to the
ridiculous notion that "words are violence," and from this, the rise of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Call-outs_and_cancellation">cancel culture</a>,
the First World pastime of mobbing, doxing, and socially destroying
anyone who dares to voice an unpopular opinion or do something stupid. This cancel
culture was born of social media. Sure, some might blame other factors like liberal
arts education but really they're nothing new to society. But I'll tell you what changed.</p>

        
            
<p>Back in the good old days (when you didn't need 32gb of
memory to browse the web), Twitter and Facebook used to display a chronological
feed of your friends' posts. This was very functional, but ended up creating a problem
for the social media companies: in order to maximize the amount of time you spend on
their sites they needed you to friend/follow tons of people (even people you aren't really
friends with). But if you did that, your feed would turn into a shitshow, with too
much content for any person keep up with. So Facebook and Twitter went back to the
drawing board and came up with a fantastic innovation: the algorithmic content feed
(aka. the death of society and end of the Internet). The feed algorithm could "get
into your head" with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychographics">psychographic microtargeting</a>,
allowing the machine to recommend content and advertisements that <em>you</em> are likely to
"engage" with—click, like, share,
anything to keep you on the site and viewing more ads a little longer.</p>
<p>The deprecation of the chronological timeline in favor of the
machine-curated content feed had major psychological side effects for everyone involved.
When the machine decided what content to recommend it would favor content that is most
likely to create engagement; this trends toward content that creates an emotional
response, which on the Internet is most often outrageous content that evokes fear or
anger. By bombarding people with upsetting shit and exposing them to "communities" of other
people <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/circle-jerk">circlejerking</a> about how upsetting
everything is, the machine dialed the filter
bubble effect up to 11, essentially dividing people into groups and then radicalizing
them with increasingly extremist content. And in the process,
<strong>Facebook and Twitter radicalized the actual publishers of content.</strong></p>
<p>Remember when you could pick up a newspaper or turn on
your television and get news coverage that seemed at least superficially factual
and unbiased? Obviously those days are gone. Newspapers are mostly out of business,
TV viewership is down, and the dying husk of our mainstream media is increasingly
obsessed with a contrived "culture war." Traditional media has been superceded by
the Internet, and with social media dominating peoples' time spent on
the Internet, Facebook and Twitter have become gatekeepers between the
publishers and their viewers. Factual and unbiased reporting is simply not engaging
enough and will not appear on peoples' feeds. Only breathless hyperbolic
fear-mongering and rage porn will break through the algorithm and get clicks.
Mainstream publishers have been forced to shift their entire media strategies
around <em>online engagement</em> as they desperately attempt to stay relevant on the Internet.
And what's more engaging than a controversy? Thus,
mainstream publishers have "picked sides" that resonate with their
audiences'
filter bubbles in the artifical culture war, promoting non-newsworthy events
into manufactured controversies, and sparking mob action with headlines like
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/11/us/goya-foods-unanue-trump-hispanic-market/index.html">"Here's why [food CEO's] meeting with [world leader] is prObLeMaTiC."</a></p>
<p>And that brings us to recent months, where
after locking every person of fighting age in closet-sized apartments, where peoples' only
access to the outside world was filtered through the toxic lens of social media, and
where the only information available was underpinned by fear and outrage, people
lost their shit. And now we're collectively hand-wringing about cancel culture (but
being real careful not to upset the mob.)</p>
<p>But here's the thing: cancel culture is irrelevant if you don't give a fuck.
You are not a prisoner of groupthink. You might be a prisoner of your belief
that you should give a fuck. But that is under your control. We are not living
a George Orwell hellscape, memes like
<em>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a> was a warning, not
an instruction manual"</em> fall flat. The premise that we should care what a bunch
of larpy wannabe do-gooders think on Twitter and Facebook is false.
It doesn't matter—you can't lose a game you don't play. Cancel culture was born
of social media. <strong>If we cancel Facebook and Twitter</strong>, we can break the cycle of
extreme division and hyperbolic microtargeting, shatter the filter bubbles,
and reclaim our access to information from monopolistic ad targeting algorithms.
By divorcing our attention from these toxic echo chambers, manufactured controversies
will become less profitable,
people will be able to think more critically and talk to each other more sincerely,
and cancel culture will end organically. There are really no major drawbacks.</p>
<p>So much of our time online is <em>wasted</em> creating, curating, and "defending"
these perfectly plastic personas, avatars, idealized identities that represent
some vague notion of a persistent sense of self on the Internet. And for what?
Do you really talk to your 600 Facebook friends? Do you even give a shit about
who your 10,000 Instagram followers are? Do they give a shit about you? No.
People waste so much of their lives trying to stake out an online identity that
they start to believe it actually matters, <em>but it doesn't.</em>
<strong>A persistent online identity is a liability, not an asset.</strong></p>
<p>We are all tempted by the lie that social networks base their existence on:
that we need to put our "selves" online for all to see. This lie is a mental hack,
exploiting our human need for meaningful interactions with other people,
as well as the dark aspects of human nature: ego, anger and trauma. As society
increasingly isolates and divides humans from one another physically and
socially, we are tempted by the lie that our online personas form a meaningful
extension of our real-world selves.</p>
<p>Sadly, the vast majority of our interactions on social media are hollow, and the
few glimmers of meaningful connections with others that <em>do</em> occur
instill a Pavlovian-style hope, an addictive draw to keep us infinitely scrolling
through our algorithmically-curated content feeds in the vain hope that the
machine will bring meaning to the emptiness of our lives. But social media is little more
than mental masturbation. The service is free but the price we pay is dear.</p>
<p>When you put your real self online, you open yourself up to attack.
Like a federal indictment, the mob can come for anyone at any time. Whether or
not you are a good person is irrelevant, and trying to craft your online persona
to appease the mob is a loser's game. As the filter bubbles increasingly divide-and-circlejerk
people into more extreme viewpoints, what passes for acceptable
behavior today could be heresy tomorrow. And when your name, your employer, and
your family are all connected to your social media presence, you put yourself in
real world danger for very little real world benefit.</p>
<p>So what can you do? <strong>Cancel yourself.</strong> Delete your social media presence.
Sever the link between your online self and your real-world self. Seriously.
<em>You can't lose a game you don't play.</em></p>
<p>But wait, <em>isn't this extreme?</em> Maybe it is, or maybe you're just addicted to
social media. I've talked to a lot of people about this and heard some common
excuses people use to rationalize addictive behavior to themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But social media is an important part of my professional network."</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I can only speak anecdotally. I've built a successful career without using LinkedIn
or other social networks to promote myself. My work ethic, skill and reputation have
carried me
as far as I care to go in my field. Also anecdotally, when I hired a contractor
to remodel my basement, I didn't check her Facebook page; I saw her work at a
neighbor's house and asked them to put me in touch. She did a great job on
my basement (and later posted photos of it to her Instagram). Good work
promotes itself.</p>
<p>But what doesn't work is when the line between personal and professional gets
blurred, which is almost inevitable on a medium designed around social
interaction. The tension between <em>being a professional</em> and <em>having an opinion</em> is
overwhelming for some people. The person who lists in their Twitter bio that
they "work for Google" and "bash the fash" isn't doing themself or their employer
any favors. Such tact only works for those who stay in the good graces of the mob,
which is, again, a loser's game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"But I use social media to keep in touch with my school friends."</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>No you …</p></article></div>

                        <blockquote>"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." - George Bernard Shaw</blockquote><p>I grew up in a family where I was taught to be likable. To please, to impress, and to make others happy. Seems like a pretty good idea, right?</p><p>While likeability is a good trait if you want to be popular it isn't ideal if you want to achieve. Let me explain.</p><p>Popularity feels good. Being liked feels good. Humans evolved as social creatures and we crave attention from each other. This pattern plays out over and over in schoolyards, bars, and workplaces, or anywhere humans meet. And the cooperation needed for our survival can only happen if you're accepted by your tribe.</p><p>However, praise by the masses won't make you successful, let alone fulfilled. Actually it's more likely that <em>popularity will prevent you from being successful.</em></p><p>Movie stars, professional athletes, and a business visionaries–we all want to be them. We grow up trying to be them. Personally, I've long idolized Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. But most of our heroes got to where they are by being unlikeable, not likable.</p><p>We love these men and women for being unique yet we internally berate ourselves for being different. These heroes have been described as annoying, difficult, stubborn, and unreasonable. Not exactly what we strive to read about ourselves in peer reviews. Sure, they have some popularity, but it's not all rainbows. Was Gandhi liked? Yes, but he also had millions of people who were against him, and ultimately murdered him. So if it's the oddballs that we look up to, why do we try to be so likable?</p><p>This aversion to difference starts early. Bullies throughout life pick on the kid who is different, on the easy target. Additionally modern culture has decided that the best path in life is to do as you're told; follow the rules, stay in line, and smile. Follow the leader and be a good girl/boy. The scripture of conformity is pervasive.</p><p>And there is true merit to fitting in. Society can't exist without collectively agreed upon rules. Early on we learn that being a three year old hellion is unacceptable has consequences. If I spit out my Cheerios one more time mom will be angry mom, so I'm going to be nice.</p><p>So we're taught to fit in. Be likable and hide your "flaws". Like the only white fish in a school of black fish you don't want to be the different one when a shark is on the prowl. Blend in and don't stand out. Seek group acceptance.</p><p>While conformity has its place in keeping society running, too much conformity stunts progress.</p><p>Differences are what make you, you and me, me. They're what make change possible. Change comes from differences, not from more of the same. After all, a species evolves based on small aberrations, on "flaws", that turn into strengths and a better way of being.</p><p>All progress comes from those who see the world differently. First they act differently and then they convince others to see differently as well. They don't accept the status quo and they don't assimilate.</p><p>Generally speaking this results in being unpopular. Many of the people who helped change the world aren't liked even in the height of their success. But they kept pushing their indomitable will against the world, and eventually, the world shifted ever so slightly.</p><p>Practice being unreasonable this week. Don't "yes" your way through life, following someone else's path for you. Be a bit more of a jerk. Be more demanding. Piss a few people off.</p><p>And be okay with it. Be okay with people being angry or mad or annoyed with you. Cultivate your ability to keep pushing towards your goals despite what others say.</p><p>And who knows, maybe you'll see the world shift ever so slightly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    
    <p>The human brain is a marvel of biological engineering. It allowed us to accumulate and pass on the knowledge of many prior generations throughout millennia, resulting in a civilization that went into space, taught computers to see and speak, and that continually discovers and investigates the laws of the Universe.</p>
<p>Its complexity is astounding, and we do not fully understand it yet. And because of that, occasionally, myths about the functioning of the brain pop out. Among the most prominent such legends is the one that claims we are dormant geniuses. But before analyzing and debunking that, let’s discuss some brain facts.</p>
<h2 id="size-does-not-matter">Size Does Not Matter</h2>
<p>For instance, did you know that the brain weighs around 1300-1400 grams? It represents only 2% of the total body weight of a 150 pound or 70kg human. However, it requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% of total cardiac output (the blood that flows in our body);</li>
<li>20% of total body oxygen;</li>
<li>25% of total body glucose utilization</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/brain-energy-consumption.png" alt="Human brain weight vs. energy consumption"></p>
<p>That is quite an energy-hungry organ inside our skull! But even that fades away when comparing to children: at around five years old, the human brain takes up as much as 50% of oxygen consumption<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the brain’s level of oxygen consumption does not significantly vary when you are resting vs. when you do some cognitively intense work. Overall, measures of the whole brain changes in blood flow during intense mental activity have failed to demonstrate any change. Even <em>local changes</em> in blood flow of the regions involved most in a cognitive task are often 5% or less.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, it is well known and demonstrated that glucose is the brain’s “fuel,” therefore increases in blood glucose levels can positively impact cognitive performance in some tasks.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-mystical-brain-myth">The Mystical Brain Myth</h2>
<p>There is a popular myth that we use our brains at only 10% of its capacity, thus boldly affirming that we have a whopping 90% of dormant potential that we can awaken and become geniuses.</p>
<p>Unlike other widespread myths that started from a single event, or unscientific claims from poorly designed research studies (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield</a> and his fraudulent study than falsely claimed a link between vaccines and autism), the myth that humans use only 10% of their brains started at the end of the nineteenth century and was gradually strengthened by many people since then. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#Origin">Wikipedia</a> article on the subject has a lengthy explanation of the potential origin and evolution of the myth throughout the years.</p>
<h3 id="a-small-confession">A Small Confession</h3>
<p>Before moving on, I have a revelation to make. Occasionally, I might buy a cloth item and wear it once or twice. If I recall correctly, there might have been one or two items in my experience that I have not worn at all. Do you know anyone with similar oddities?</p>
<p>This makes my wardrobe much like the brain described in the myth: I am using around 10% of it, and I can “tap into” the rest of my wardrobe should such need arise.</p>
<h3 id="your-brain-is-not-a-wardrobe">Your Brain Is Not A Wardrobe</h3>
<p>But our brain is not a collection of cloth items. Though there are still unanswered questions regarding some brain functions, brain mapping physiology demonstrates that all its areas have a purpose. And you do not have to be a neuroscientist to prove that, simply recall from your anatomy classes that the brain has different regions, such as the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and the fact that each of those lobes has its role.</p>
<h2 id="debunking-the-myth">Debunking The Myth</h2>
<p>Let’s address that myth in a more scientific manner.</p>
<p>If we are using only 10% of our brains, that means a person would be fine if the other 90% of the brain got removed. 10% of the 1400g average brain is 140g—that’s the size of a sheep’s brain.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Since I doubt sheep have their own 90% hidden potential myth, it makes no sense that humans have advanced so far as a civilization by using only part of their brains equivalent in size to a sheep’s brain.</p>
<p>There are instances in history when people were injured and got parts of their brain removed (although not as close as even 10%), the most prominent (and among the first recorded ones) being the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas Gage</a>, who survived an accident where a large iron rod was driven through his left part of the head, from the bottom of the cheek, through his left eye and frontal lobe all the way to the top of his head. He lived 12 years more after that accident. There are varying opinions on his recovery, but it took him ~10 years to recover from the unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Another example is the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Zasetsky">Lev Zasetsky</a>. A bullet entered his left parieto-occipital area and resulted in a long coma. Following this, he became unable to perceive the right side of things. Objects he did see often appeared as fragmented pieces rather than whole objects. He did not recover in the 50 years he lived after the injury.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn—The Brain Basics</a>, our brains can rewire through a process called <em>neuroplasticity,</em> which can help regain some of the lost functions as a result of an accident. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Researchers have found that only 27% of people recover from a <em><strong>concussion.</strong></em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> That means almost 3 out of 4 people do not fully recover! And this is “just” a concussion—your brain does not lose any of its parts.</p>
<p>If 90% of the brain were unnecessary, it is highly unlikely that we would not have evolved such big brains with irrelevant matter in the first place. There are several factors for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical risk of childbirth deaths due to the big skull size would stress out the selection of offspring with smaller brain sizes.</li>
<li>Natural selection favors characteristics that offer an advantage of some sort over the other. There is no way such a big brain would have formed in the first place if it wouldn’t be necessary for survival.</li>
<li>As already mentioned, the brain requires an enormous amount of energy. Even if we had 90% of the brain unused and suddenly were to “wake” it, we couldn’t provide our brains with enough power, as it already consumes 20%-25% of the entire body resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this scientific evidence works against this myth. We indeed use only some areas of the brain at any given time, but throughout the day, we use all of it, not just 10%. And next time you hear about this myth, recall the sheep brain weight.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, I built a DIY pen plotter (mostly) from scratch. I'd been
meaning to post a build log, because this was one of the more enjoyable hardware
projects I've worked on recently. However, it's taken a while to write-up this
project because, well,
<a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/03/24/March-Updates/">there was a lot of stuff going on</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-a-plotter">Why Build a Plotter?</h2>
<p>So, why is it worth building a pen plotter? The short answer is, “they're cool”.
The longer answer is that, despite commercial printers (ink jet, laser, etc.)
working better for general purpose printing, the quality of a pen-plotted image
is noticeably different than something that's been traditionally printed.
Plotted images can have a more natural, organic feeling to them, because they're
produced by raising and lowering a pen manually, like a human does.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I've also had a persistent curiosity with
<a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2019/03/07/Generative-Doodling/">generative art</a>. Much of the community
built around generative art (colloquially,
<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter">#plottertwitter</a>) uses pen plotters
to turn “bits into atoms”. While most folks opt to buy a commercial plotter like
the <a href="https://axidraw.com/">Axidraw</a> or restore vintage plotters from the 1980's,
there's a growing community of people building their own plotters.</p>
<h2 id="assembling-the-components">Assembling the Components</h2>
<p>The first step in the project was collecting the bill of materials (BOM).
There's a well-researched BOM on the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/blob/master/Docs/mechanical_BOM.md">project Github</a>.
Other than the midTbot PCB, which is for sale
<a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/33366583/midtbot-esp32-v2-controller-kit/">on Tindie</a>,
I had to order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear shafts and Linear Bearings (Amazon)</li>
<li>Pulleys and Idler Pulleys (Amazon)</li>
<li>Rubber Timing Belt (Amazon)</li>
<li>2 Stepper Motors (Amazon)</li>
<li>Stepper Motor Controllers (Amazon)</li>
<li>12V 3A Power Supply (Already had one)</li>
<li>Basic Hobby Servo Motor (Already had one from previous Arduino projects)</li>
<li>Assorted M3/M5 Head Screws (Home Depot, Ali Express)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised how available most of the parts were online –
everything except for the screws/nuts were available on Amazon.</p>
<p>Once I received my midTbot PCB, there was some soldering and assembly to do. I
followed
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Controller-Kit-Assembly-Instructions">these instructions</a>
to attach the homing switches, power supply, and header pins to the board.</p>
<h3 id="printing-the-chassis">Printing the Chassis</h3>
<p>The chassis of the midTbot is entirely 3D printed. There are ~7 things that you
need to print
(<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/tree/master/STL">source files</a> on
Github), and they're all fairly simple shapes, so the prints were easy to do.</p>
<figure>

        <p>Completed prints of the ‘feet’ and tailblock pieces</p>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The hardest thing to print (and the most finicky part of the project in general)
was the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/blob/master/STL/midt_esp32_pen_mnt.stl">pen mount</a>.
This piece has some overhangs on it, so it was important to configure the
printer to add support material.</p>
<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>
<p>With the PCB assembled, mechanical parts purchased, and chassis pieces printed,
it was time to do the final assembly. Again, I followed the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Assembly-Instructions">assembly instructions</a>
on the project Github.</p>
<p>The assembly process was straightforward: the PCB gets screwed into one of the
printed pieces, the pulleys and linear rods get screwed in to the “feet” and
carriage block pieces, and the stepper motors are secured to the chassis with
the PCB “sandwiched” in between the chassis and the motors.</p>
<p>One difficult step was attaching the stepper motors to the PCB. Per the project
instructions, you're supposed to solder the stepper motor wires into plastic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_header">pin sockets</a>, so you can easily
detach the motors from the PCB. But, after I tried and failed several times to
solder the stepper motors into the female socket block, I simply soldered the
female sockets to the board directly and soldered the stepper motor wires onto
solid-core jumper wires. The end result wasn't as clean as what's shown in the
project instructions, but still allowed me to hot-swap the motors if needed.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Once the main “chunk” of the plotter was assembled (pictured above), the only
things left to do were to thread the timing belt around the pulleys, and attach
both ends of the belt to the pen head with a small amount of tension.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/full_plotter2.jpg">

    </figure>

<p>The last step in assembly (and, unfortunately the most fiddly part of the whole
process) was attaching the pen holder to the “head” block. The long screw that
makes the joint between the pen holder and “head” block needs to be tuned
meticulously: If the screw is too tight, then the pen can get stuck in the “up”
position – not returning to the “down” position when the servo retracts. On the
other hand, if the screw is too loose, then this translates to “slop” in the
pen's position, which results in wiggly drawings that are unusable.</p>

    </figure>

<p>At this point, the bot was assembled! I powered it on and installed a specific
version of the <a href="https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32">Grbl_Esp32</a> firmware
designed for the midTbot per the
<a href="https://github.com/bdring/midTbot_esp32/wiki/Compiling-Firmware-for-the-MidTBot">project instructions</a>.
Grbl_Esp32 is a really nifty piece of software: it allows you to upload an run
Gcode (basically, machine readable instructions for how to move the pen) on the
plotter's Esp32 controller. Since the Esp32 has built-in wifi (and bluetooth),
its able to serve a basic web UI:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/webui.png">

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The Web UI is sufficient for most tasks: homing, minor positioning adjustments,
starting/pausing/resuming prints. There are only a few tasks – like calibration
– that require you to drop down to the Grbl “command line”.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get my midTbot calibrated. The project documentation was a
bit light on the specifics, so there was a lot of trial-and-error and
troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="plotting-software">Plotting, Software</h2>
<p>Now that I had a functioning plotter bot, the next thing to do was try it out.
Of course, to do so you need to actually produce Gcode that the bot can use.
There are tons of tools to do this – and a full discussion of Gcode/plotter
software is worth a whole other post. Suffice it to say, there are a variety of
resources on the <a href="https://drawingbots.net/knowledge/tools">Drawing Bots</a>
community page that serve as a good starting point.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time working with <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>‘s
Gcodetools plugin. Axidraw (which makes a commercial pen plotter) also has some
useful
<a href="https://wiki.evilmadscientist.com/Axidraw_Software_Installation">Inkscape plugins</a>,
although some of the functionality won't work with the midTbot. Gcodetools
nominally allows you to translate SVGs to Gcode, however this is a tedious
process. <em>Not just any</em> SVG will work well with it; the SVG basically already
needs to be a line drawing for Gcodetools to have any hope of working correctly.
It has basic support for infilled regions too, but again you have to be careful
with it – any slight hiccup, and it produces unusable Gcode.</p>
<p>To be honest, the software aspect of pen plotting is the most frustrating part
of the workflow. I haven't yet found a great toolchain for the “art” -&gt; Gcode
pipeline, so there's a lot of finicky steps. (It doesn't help that Inkscape is a
second-class X11 app on macOS…)</p>
<h2 id="additional-hardware-modifications">Additional Hardware Modifications</h2>
<p>After I ordered a midTbot PCB, the creator added me to a Slack group. Some of
the other folks who'd built midTbots contributed back modifications they'd made
to their builds. I took a couple of these and added them to my bot too:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/pen_mount.jpg">

        <p>Magnetic Pen Mount with Thumb Screw</p>
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>First, I ordered heftier thumb screws for the pen attachment (as pictured); the
screws in the original BOM are tricky to manipulate by hand. Second, I printed a
magnetic detachable pen holder (as pictured) which makes it easier to add/remove
pens without disturbing the rest of the setup. If you want to do multicolor
prints, this modification is a must. Finally, I printed wider supports for the
bots frame. Supposedly, this allows you to increase the available print size of
the bot (if you also order longer linear rods). I didn't get around to actually
increasing my bot's print size, but the wider supports made the bot more stable,
and easier to attach to a work table.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>After an afternoon of calibrating the bot and installing the mods I discussed
above, I got some prints that I'm pretty happy with.</p>
<figure>
    <a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2020/07/12/Building-a-DIY-Pen-Plotter-midTbot/triangle.jpg">

    </figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>Sierpinski's triangle (above) is a single line, but has a lot of intricate
detail. This is a good exercise of the precision of the stepper motors, which as
you can see is quite good. The precision also requires the pen mount to be
calibrated correctly, so that there isn't any “slop” between the pen and the
body of the plotter.</p>

<p>This was a slightly harder pattern for the bot to draw. The lines are all
straight, but there are a fair number of pen raises. Generally, the more pen
up/down cycles a print has, the greater the likelihood of failure.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that <em>where</em> the pattern is in the print area of the bot makes
a difference. The closer the pen head is to the main bot chassis, the more the
pen is pulled away from the paper due to the counterweight of the “tail”
section. As such, I tried to position the prints as close to the middle of the
print area as possible. Below is what happens when the pen holder misbehaves:</p>

<p>The plot isn't a complete failure, but many of the lines don't get drawn or only
get partially drawn. This is often caused by the pen mount screw being too
tight, causing the pen …</p></div></div>

		<p>July 13, 2020</p><p>As well as being a search engine, Elasticsearch is also a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/intro-to-aggregations">powerful analytics engine</a>. However in order to take full advantage of the near-real-time analytics capabilities of Elasticsearch, it is often useful to add structure to your data <em>as it is ingested</em> into Elasticsearch. The reasons for this are explained very well in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/schema-on-write-vs-schema-on-read">schema on write vs. schema on read</a> article, and for the remainder of this blog, when I talk about structuring data, I am referring to <em>schema on write</em>.</p>

<p>Because of the importance of structuring your data, in this blog I will show you how to add structure to unstructured documents by using an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/ingest.html">ingest node</a> with the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/grok-processor.html">Grok Processor</a>. Then, I will describe a simple method to construct new Grok patterns, and a method that can be used to debug errors in existing Grok patterns. Finally I will provide links to some publicly available Grok patterns and then briefly mention the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/dissect-processor.html">Dissect Processor</a> as a possible alternative to Grok.</p>

<p>As a side note, if you are going to put in the effort to structure your data, you should consider structuring your data so that it conforms to the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-the-elastic-common-schema">Elastic Common Schema</a>, which will facilitate the analysis of data from diverse sources.</p>



<p>It is not uncommon to see documents sent to Elasticsearch that are similar to the following.:</p>

<pre>{<br>  "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre>

<p>The message field in the above document contains unstructured data. It is a series of words and numbers that are not suitable for near-real-time analytics. In order to take full advantage of the powerful analytics capabilities of Elasticsearch, we should parse the message field to extract relevant data. For example, we could extract the following fields from the above message:</p>

<pre>"host.ip": "55.3.244.1"&nbsp;<br>"http.request.method": "GET"<br>"url.original": "/index.html"<br>"http.request.bytes": 15824<br>"event.duration": 0.043</pre>

<p>Adding such a structure will allow you to unleash the full power of Elasticsearch on your data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/grok-processor.html">Grok</a> is a tool that can be used to extract structured data out of a given text field within a document. You define a field to extract data from, as well as the Grok pattern for the match. Grok sits on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>. However, unlike regular expressions, Grok patterns are made up of <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">reusable patterns</a>, which can themselves be composed of other Grok patterns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before going into details of how to build and debug your own Grok patterns, we first give a quick overview of what a Grok pattern looks like, how it can be used in an ingest pipeline, and how it can be simulated. Don’t worry if you don’t fully understand the details of the Grok expression yet, as these details will be discussed in-depth in the following sections of this blog.</p>

<p>In the previous section we presented an example document that looks as follows:</p><pre>{<br>  "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre><p><br>The desired structure can extracted from this example message field by using the following Grok expression:</p>

<pre>%{IP:host.ip} %{WORD:http.request.method} %{URIPATHPARAM:url.original} %{NUMBER:http.request.bytes:int} %{NUMBER:event.duration:double} %{GREEDYDATA}</pre>

<p>And we define a pipeline which contains this Grok pattern inside a Grok processor.</p>

<pre>PUT _ingest/pipeline/example_grok_pipeline<br>{<br>  "description": "A simple example of using Grok",<br>  "processors": [<br>    {<br>      "grok": {<br>        "field": "message",<br>        "patterns": [<br>          "%{IP:host.ip} %{WORD:http.request.method} %{URIPATHPARAM:url.original} %{NUMBER:http.request.bytes:int} %{NUMBER:event.duration:double} %{GREEDYDATA}"<br>        ]<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ]<br>}</pre>

<p>We can then <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/simulate-pipeline-api.html">simulate the above pipeline</a> with the following command.</p>

<pre>POST _ingest/pipeline/example_grok_pipeline/_simulate<br>{<br>  "docs": [<br>    {<br>      "_source": {<br>        "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ]<br>}</pre>

<p>Which responds with a structured document that looks as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>{<br>  "docs" : [<br>    {<br>      "doc" : {<br>        "_index" : "_index",<br>        "_type" : "_doc",<br>        "_id" : "_id",<br>        "_source" : {<br>          "host" : {<br>            "ip" : "55.3.244.1"<br>          },<br>          "http" : {<br>            "request" : {<br>              "method" : "GET",<br>              "bytes" : 15824<br>            }<br>          },<br>          "message" : "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff",<br>          "event" : {<br>            "duration" : 0.043<br>          },<br>          "url" : {<br>            "original" : "/index.html"<br>          }<br>        },<br>        "_ingest" : {<br>          "timestamp" : "2020-06-24T22:41:47.153985Z"<br>        }<br>      }<br>    }<br>  ]<br>}</pre><p><br>This document contains the original unstructured&nbsp; message field, and it also contains all of the additional fields which have been extracted from the message. We now have a document that contains structured data!</p>



<p>In the above example we <em>simulated</em> execution of an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/pipeline.html">ingest pipeline</a> that contains our Grok pattern, but didn’t actually run it on any real documents. An ingest pipeline is designed to process documents at ingest time, as described in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/ingest.html">ingest node documentation</a>. One way to execute an ingest pipeline is by adding the pipeline name to the <em>PUT</em> command as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>PUT example_index/_doc/1?pipeline=example_grok_pipeline<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre><p>And the document that has been written can be seen by executing:</p><pre>GET example_index/_doc/1</pre><p>Which will respond with the following:</p><pre>{<br>  "_index" : "example_index",<br>  "_type" : "_doc",<br>  "_id" : "1",<br>  "_version" : 2,<br>  "_seq_no" : 2,<br>  "_primary_term" : 1,<br>  "found" : true,<br>  "_source" : {<br>    "host" : {<br>      "ip" : "55.3.244.1"<br>    },<br>    "http" : {<br>      "request" : {<br>        "method" : "GET",<br>        "bytes" : 15824<br>      }<br>    },<br>    "message" : "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff",<br>    "event" : {<br>      "duration" : 0.043<br>    },<br>    "url" : {<br>      "original" : "/index.html"<br>    }<br>  }<br>}</pre><p>Alternatively (and likely preferably), the ingest pipeline can be applied by default to all documents that are written to a given index by adding it to the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/index-modules.html#dynamic-index-settings">index settings</a>:</p>

<pre>PUT example_index/_settings<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"index.default_pipeline": "example_grok_pipeline"<br>}</pre>



<p>After adding the pipeline to the settings, any documents that are written to <em>example_index</em> will automatically have the <em>example_grok_pipeline</em> applied to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This can be verified by writing a new document to <em>example_index</em> as follows:</p>

<pre>PUT example_index/_doc/2<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"message": "66.3.244.1 GET /index.html 500 0.120 new other stuff"<br>} </pre>

<p>And the document that has been written can be seen by executing:</p>

<pre>GET example_index/_doc/2</pre>

<p>Which, as expected will return the document that we just wrote. This document has the new fields that were extracted from the message field:</p>

<pre>{<br>  "_index" : "example_index",<br>  "_type" : "_doc",<br>  "_id" : "2",<br>  "_version" : 3,<br>  "_seq_no" : 2,<br>  "_primary_term" : 1,<br>  "found" : true,<br>  "_source" : {<br>    "host" : {<br>      "ip" : "66.3.244.1"<br>    },<br>    "http" : {<br>      "request" : {<br>        "method" : "GET",<br>        "bytes" : 500<br>      }<br>    },<br>    "message" : "66.3.244.1 GET /index.html 500 0.120 new other stuff",<br>    "event" : {<br>      "duration" : 0.12<br>    },<br>    "url" : {<br>      "original" : "/index.html"<br>    }<br>  }<br>}</pre>



<p>In the previous section, we presented an example document with the following structure:</p><pre>{<br>  "message": "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043 other stuff"<br>}</pre><p>And we then used the following Grok pattern to extract structured data from the message field:</p>

<pre>"%{IP:host.ip} %{WORD:http.request.method} %{URIPATHPARAM:url.original} %{NUMBER:http.request.bytes:int} %{NUMBER:event.duration:double} %{GREEDYDATA}"</pre>

<p>As described in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/grok-processor.html">Grok Processor documentation</a>, the syntax for Grok patterns comes in three forms: <em>%{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}, %{SYNTAX}, %{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC:TYPE}</em>, all of which we can see in the above Grok pattern.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <em>SYNTAX</em> is the name of the pattern that will match your text. Built-in <em>SYNTAX</em> patterns <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">can be seen on github</a>.</li><li>The <em>SEMANTIC</em> is the name of the field that will store the data that matches the <em>SYNTAX</em> pattern.</li><li>The <em>TYPE</em> is the data type you wish to cast your named field.</li></ul>

<p>The first part of the Grok pattern is the following:</p>

<pre>%{IP:host.ip}</pre>

<p>This declaration matches an IP address (corresponding to the <em>IP</em> Grok pattern) and stores it in a field called <em>host.ip</em>. Four our example data, this will extract a value of <em>55.3.244.1</em> and store it in the <em>host.ip</em> field.</p>

<p>If we want more details on the <em>IP</em> Grok pattern, we can look into the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">Grok patterns on Github</a>, and we will see the following definition:&nbsp;</p>

<pre>IP (?:%{IPV6}|%{IPV4})</pre>

<p>This means that the <em>IP</em> pattern will match one of the <em>IPV6</em> or <em>IPV4</em> Grok patterns. To understand what the <em>IPV6</em> and <em>IPV4</em> patterns are, once again we can look into the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">Grok patterns on Github</a> to see their definitions, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next part of the Grok pattern is a single whitespace character followed by the following expression:</p>

<pre>%{WORD:http.request.method}</pre>

<p>This portion of the Grok expression extracts the word <em>GET</em> from the <em>message</em>&nbsp;and stores it into the <em>http.request.method</em> field. If we want to understand the definition of the <em>WORD</em> pattern, we can look at the <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/7.8/libs/grok/src/main/resources/patterns/grok-patterns">Grok patterns on Github</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One can do the same kind of analysis to understand the patterns that match the <em>url.original</em>, <em>request.bytes</em> and <em>event.duration</em> fields, which we leave as an exercise for the reader</p>

<p>Finally, the last statement in the Grok pattern is the following:</p>

<pre>%{GREEDYDATA}</pre>

<p>This expression does not have a <em>SEMANTIC</em> part, which means that the matching data is not stored into any field.&nbsp; Additionally, the <em>GREEDYDATA</em> Grok pattern will consume as much text as it can, which means that in our example it will match everything after the <em>event.duration</em> field. The <em>GREEDYDATA</em> expression will come in handy when debugging complex Grok patterns, as discussed in the following sections of this blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When constructing a new Grok pattern, it is often easiest to construct the Grok pattern incrementally starting from the left and working towards the right side of the unstructured text that we are trying to match.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a href="https://petsymposium.org/2020/files/papers/issue1/popets-2020-0003.pdf"><strong>Discontinued Privacy: Personal Data Leaks in Apple Bluetooth-Low-Energy Continuity Protocols</strong></a></h4>

<p>We found that Apple devices are leaking sensitive information in the BLE wireless signals they emit. Those issues are associated with the Apple Continuity services and are affecting all Apple devices as well as devices compatible with the Continuity framework. Based on a reverse engineering of Continuity, we identified that the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) messages emitted by Apple devices include unencrypted data that can expose sensitive information. We discovered that those data can be easily collected by an eavesdropper and processed in order to: track users, monitor activities in a smarthome, obtain phone number, email addresses and Apple Voice Assistant, Siri, commands, and more.</p>
<p><img src="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png" alt="" width="822" height="385" srcset="https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy.png 822w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-300x141.png 300w, https://team.inria.fr/privatics/files/2019/10/Discontinued-Privacy-768x360.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p>

<h2>BLE advertising</h2>
<p>In BLE, devices broadcast short messages, called Advertising Packets, to announce their presence and feature to nearby devices (those messages can be observed from an Android device using an application like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contextis.android.BLEScanner&amp;hl=en">Ramble</a>). Advertising Packets can include the name of the device, its type, but can also include custom data in a field called Manufacturer specific. This field is typically used by vendors to transmit data for application. Apple make use of this field to include data for its Continuity Protocols.</p>
<h2>Apple Continuity Protocols</h2>
<p>Apple has developed a number of features, called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681"><i>Continuity</i></a>, that are designed to increase the usability of its products. Those features include: activity transfert, file transfert (airDrop), Wi-Fi password sharing, etc. The communication between nearby devices, required by Continuity services, is done by using BLE. Continuity data are embedded in BLE advertising packets and are broadcast to be picked up by nearby devices.</p>

<h2>Data exposed in cleartext</h2>
<p>We found that, even though some elements are encrypted, most of the data included in Continuity messages is sent in plain text. The exposed data can thus be passively collected by an eavesdropper and exploited to mount one of the attack presented below.</p>
<h2>Tracking users (iPhones, iPad, airpods …)</h2>
<p>We found that the content of <i>Apple Continuity </i>BLE messages can be used to track the device despite the use address randomization. We have identified several elements that remain constant over time or that can undermine the anti-tracking feature mechanism (i.e. address randomization). For instance, we found that messages emitted by earpods include information (battery levels and lid open counter) that can be exploited to track the earpod set. We also discovered a novel attack that would allow tracking by actively replaying BLE messages. An passive attacker could exploit this information to track the the location of individuals in spite of address randomization, the anti-tracking feature of BLE.</p>
<h2>Linking device belonging to the same iCloud account</h2>
<p>We discovered that it is possible to link together devices associated to the same iCloud account. This attack relies on the replay of messages that will trigger a response only from devices associated to the same <i>iCloud</i> account. An attacker could exploit this to identify all the device belonging to a person, and could narrow down its home if some device are left there.</p>
<h2>Monitoring activities in a smart home (Homekit)</h2>
<p>We found that messages emitted by <i>Homekit</i>-compatible devices can betray the activity in a smart-home. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"><i>Homekit</i></a> is a smart-home framework developed by <i>Apple</i> and found in <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit">devices</a> of <i>Apple</i> and other vendors (…). <i>Homekit</i> devices using BLE continuously emit messages that include an indicator reflecting the device state. For instance, in the case of a lightbulb, this indicator changes only when it is either turned on or turned off. Similarly, in an infrared movement detector, the indicator changes only when a person crosses the detection field. In-lab experiments showed that a passive attacker can leverage Homekit BLE messages to track the evolution of devices in a household and thus monitor the activities of the occupants.</p>
<h2>Device model, software version and more</h2>
<p>We found that a number of messages expose a wide variety of information on the emitting device characteristics and state: device model, OS version, device color, cellular connectivity, battery level, current activity etc.</p>
<h2>E-mail address and Phone numbers (Airdrop &amp; Nearby)</h2>
<p>We found that when using features such as Airdop and Nearby, devices emit messages from which email addresses and phone numbers can be extracted. Continuity services allow to seamlessly share resources with nearby devices: Airdrop to share files, Nearby to share Wi-Fi network credential. Prior exchange of information, the devices establish their identity by exchange identifiers over BLE: email addresses and/or phone numbers. Those identifiers are not sent in clear but are rather hashed using a cryptographic hash-function. This obfuscation can be bypassed in most cases and the identifiers recovered.</p>
<h2>Voice assistant commands (Siri)</h2>
<p>We found that when activated via voice, the Siri voice assistant will generate a message including a digital fingerprint of the command. Although the raw audio signal cannot be reconstructed from it, the fingerprint could be leveraged to infer the command.</p>

<p>The vulnerabilities identified were reported to Apple, Osram and Eve on May 29 th , 2019.</p>

          <div>
            <p><!--block-->Back in May my wife and I decided to move out of our flat in Bristol.</p>

<p>By then we had already been living for a couple of months with my in-laws and it didn't make sense to keep paying £1k+/month in rent.</p>

<p>After some discussion, we decided to throw some money at the problem and put all our stuff in a storing facility.</p>

<p>I started googling storage companies in Bristol and I was quickly overwhelmed by the number of options (pro tip: don't start a storage business, it's ridicolously competitive).</p>

<p>Every company allowed me you to get an online quote by entering the size of the storing unit and how long I wanted to rent it for.</p>

<p>But one company did things differently.</p>

<p>On top of asking me the same two questions, UK Storage Company also <strong>asked me to choose a discount</strong>.</p>

<div>
<p><span data-trix-cursor-target="left" data-trix-serialize="false">ï»¿</span><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manuel.friger.io/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/205/content_Screenshot_2020-07-10_Your_storage_quote_is_below%281%29.png"></p></div>

<p>At first, I was confused.</p>

<p>I wondered why they would allow me to choose my own discount. Then I realised it was the good ol' "the longer you commit, the less you pay" gimmick.</p>

<p><strong>Same technique, different framing.</strong><br>
UK Storage Company put me in the driver's seat and empowered me to make my decision.</p>

<p>That's when my brain started whirring and buzzing, and one question began to form in my head: what if I used the same framing <a href="https://referralhero.com/">for my SaaS product</a>?</p>

<p>After all, cash-flow is king for (bootstrapped) startups and having people commit to yearly plans helps to lower churn.</p>

<p>Would that have any effect on how many people choose the longer plans (biannual or annual) over the monthly one?</p>

<p>That same day I <a href="https://twitter.com/manuel_frigerio/status/1264609587413553155">tweeted about it</a> and updated the checkout page of my app as shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manuel.friger.io/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/206/content_Screenshot_2020-07-10_ReferralHero_-_Advanced_Referral_Marketing_Software_.png"></p>



<h2><!--block-->The results</h2>

<p><!--block-->After 7 weeks the experiment has been a great success.<br>
With the new framing, the percentage of people who chose the biannual or annual plan <strong>has gone from 4.8% to 19%</strong>, a rather nice <strong>395% increase</strong>.<br>
<span data-trix-cursor-target="right" data-trix-serialize="false"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manuel.friger.io/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/207/content_chart.png"></span><br>
I've done several pricing experiments over the years but none of them has been as successful and in such short space of time.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more interesting is that <strong>more than twice as many people chose the annual plan over the biannual plan</strong>.</p>

<p>My hunch is that this is due to the higher discount rate of the annual plan (35% for 12 months vs 15% for 6 months means an extra 5% discount when you choose the annual plan), which increases the perceived value.</p>

<h2><!--block-->Never stop experimenting</h2>

<p><!--block-->There's a small handful of levers you can pull to grow a business and <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/charge-more">pricing is probably the most underutilised one</a>. Most SaaS businesses choose a pricing model and rarely, if ever, review it.</p>

<p>A better (and more profitable) approach is to run small experiments. If they work, incorporate them. If they don't, try something else.</p>

<p>Some people are scared that changing things will upset their customers but the truth is:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->you are allowed to change whatever you want about your business.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->you can always revert back. Nothing is fixed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->in reality, nobody cares.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2><!--block-->Do it yourself</h2>

<p><!--block-->If you want to try this experiment in your business, here are a couple of suggestions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><!--block-->don't <a href="https://medium.com/@FlorentGeerts/the-jam-experiment-how-choice-overloads-makes-consumers-buy-less-d610f8c37b9b">overload people</a> with options; have maximum 3.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>to nudge people towards one option, offer a substantially higher discount (like I did with the yearly plan)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Don't try to be sneaky and word the options properly. As you can see in my example, people know exactly what they get and how much they pay.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>ask people immediately after sign-up when they are in the right frame of mind. In my experience, asking people to switch to yearly plans a couple of months after they have used your product triggers many more questions in their mind, whereas by asking them before they try your product you're putting them in front of a simple decision: do I want to save money?</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><!--block-->As people who work in the tech industry, we are all exposed to the same ideas, patterns and filters. This is why there's so little innovation and everyone just copies what everyone else is doing.</p>

<p>Sometimes all you need to do is to look at what companies in completely different industries operate. You might be suprised what a storage company can teach you.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> If you do try this experiment, <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cf1fdf2e9f9f0dcfaeef5fbf9eeb2f5f3">let me know how it goes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> You probably want to know if we did hire that storing company in the end. The answer is NO. Eventually, we decided to hire a removal company and have all our stuff with us.</p>

Sometimes work is a pleasure, other times you do things that are unpleasant just because you have to.
But in the end motivations like money, common goal, future achievements drive us to work.
When choosing a job as a software engineer, things that motivate me and probable you are the <strong>project</strong> what I will work on,
<strong>team</strong> what I will work with and <strong>money</strong> for my personal need.
When making the final decision I usually value <strong>project over money, team over project</strong>.</p><h2>Team</h2><p>For me, the team that I will work with is the most important aspect when searching for a new job.</p><blockquote><p>“If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.” ― Confucius</p></blockquote><p>Being in a team with people that are more experienced than you is the key to fast-growing.
But don't just stay and wait when their knowledge will be transferred to you.</p><ul><li>Observe their behaviors</li><li>Make proposals and wait for feedback</li><li>Ask for advice</li><li>Ask "Why?" when they make a decision. "Why this database?" "Why this service?" ...</li></ul><p>Make sure to not push too hard on them. As this can defocus and irritate some people.</p><p>Even if your teammates aren't more experienced than you they may share interesting articles, tips, thoughts.</p><p>In the end, if you have a hard situation, maybe the project is not that interesting (at the moment) or you have problems with finishing a task,
with a great team, you can carry on and pass any issues.</p><h2>Project</h2><p>At this moment in my career, I am really focused on the technical part of a project.
I enjoy learning new tools, libraries that will increase productivity, and when coding I am trying to create a piece of art.</p><p>But also the idea and the product may still be a good motivation and even if the tech stack is not that good,
with a great team, you will refactor everything as long as you believe in the product idea.</p><p>Even if the team is not that good or you don't have a team at all, enjoying the tech stack or believing in the product
will make you continue working and loving your job.</p><p>While at the interview, I try to discover as much as possible about the project stack and idea to understand if
I am willing to accept an offer bellow my initial expectations.</p><h2>Money + benefits</h2><p>Money is important as everyone has their needs and money represent your value as a software engineer.
Employee benefits like included food, gym, short commute time may be also added to the total compensation pack.</p><p>If you have a family and bills to pay money may be a decisive factor.
But still, put everything on the table and before making the final decision ask yourself a question.</p><blockquote><p>What will be your next job after this one?</p></blockquote><p>In other words: Where will this job lead you? How much will your professional skills increase?
Will this job have temporary benefits you will bust your entire career?</p><p>Does it worth an additional 100% salary increase to work with a 5+ year old legacy codebase, old tech stack, and maybe a bad team?</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As everyone has a price I will try to conclude with some compensation examples.</p><p>If I am enjoying the project and/or the team at my current job, I would not accept a 5-15% salary increase offer,
as after 3-6 months I may get even more increase at my current job.
If I don't like the project or the team is toxic, I may accept a lower job offer just because
I will gain more from the new team or new tech stack.</p><p>Focus on your professional skills, gain maximum value from your team (don't forget to also give back and share your knowledge with teammates),
learn your tech stack, enjoy your software engineering career and the money will eventually come to you.</p></section></div></div>]]>

		<div>

			
<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" <p=""><p>Lisp has a long and rich history and so does the development of
Graphical User Interfaces in Lisp. In fact, the first GUI builder was
written in Lisp (and sold to Apple. It is now Interface Builder).</p>

<p>Lisp is also famous and unrivalled for its interactive development
capabilities, a feature even more worth having to develop GUI
applications. Can you imagine compiling one function and seeing your
GUI update instantly? We can do this with many GUI frameworks today,
even though the details differ from one to another.</p>

<p>Finally, a key part in building software is how to build it and ship
it to users. Here also, we can build self-contained binaries, for
the three main operating systems, that users can run with a double
click.</p>

<p>We aim here to give you the relevant information to help you choose
the right GUI framework and to put you on tracks. Don’t hesitate to
<a href="https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/issues/">contribute</a>, to
send more examples and to furnish the upstream documentations.</p>



<p>In this recipe, we’ll present the following GUI toolkits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tk</a> with <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/">Ltk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/index.html">Qt4</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools">Qtools</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> with <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">lispnik/iup</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gtk.org/">Gtk3</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Ferada/cl-cffi-gtk/">cl-cffi-gtk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> with <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-nuklear">Bodge-Nuklear</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you might want to have a look to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html">CAPI</a> toolkit (Common Application Programming Interface),
which is proprietary and made by LispWorks. It is a complete and cross-platform
toolkit (Windows, Gtk+, Cocoa), very praised by its users. LispWorks
also has <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/lw4mr.html">iOS and Android
runtimes</a>. Example
software built with CAPI include <a href="https://opusmodus.com/">Opusmodus</a>
or again <a href="https://scorecloud.com/">ScoreCloud</a>. It is possible to
try it with the LispWorks free demo.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/plkrueger/CocoaInterface/">CocoaInterface</a>, a
Cocoa interface for Clozure Common Lisp. Build Cocoa user interface
windows dynamically using Lisp code and bypass the typical Xcode
processes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/">McCLIM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/earl-ducaine/cl-garnet">Garnet</a> are toolkit in 100% Common Lisp. McClim even has <a href="https://techfak.de/~jmoringe/mcclim-broadway-7.ogv">a prototype</a> running in the browser with the Broadway protocol and Garnet has an ongoing interface to Gtk.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/alloy">Alloy</a>, another very new toolkit in 100% Common Lisp, used for example in the <a href="https://github.com/shinmera/kandria">Kandria</a> game.</li>
  <li><a href="https://notabug.org/cage/nodgui">nodgui</a>, a fork of Ltk, with syntax sugar and additional widgets.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/eql">eql, eql5, eql5-android</a>, embedded Qt4 and Qt5 Lisp, embedded in ECL, embeddable in Qt. Port of EQL5 to the Android platform.</li>
  <li>this <a href="https://github.com/defunkydrummer/abcl-jazz">demo using Java Swing from ABCL</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mifpasoti/Gtk-Demos">examples of using Gtk without C files with SBCL</a>, as well as GTK-server.</li>
  <li>and, last but not least, <a href="http://ceramic.github.io/">Ceramic</a>, to ship a cross-platform web app with Electron.</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as the other ones listed on <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#Gui">awesome-cl#gui</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/GUI">Cliki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tk-ltk">Tk (Ltk)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tk</a> (or Tcl/Tk, where Tcl is the programming language) has the
infamous reputation of having an outdated look. This is not (so) true
anymore since its version 8 of 1997 (!). It is probably better than
you think:</p>

<p><img src="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/assets/gui/ltk-on-macos.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Tk doesn’t have a great choice of widgets, but it has a useful canvas,
and it has a couple of unique features: we can develop a graphical
interface <strong>fully interactively</strong> and we can run the GUI <strong>remotely</strong>
from the core app.</p>

<p>So, Tk isn’t fancy, but it is an used and proven GUI toolkit (and
programming language) still used in the industry. It can be a great
choice to quickly create simple GUIs, to leverage its ease of deployment, or
when stability is required.</p>

<p>The Lisp binding is <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/">Ltk</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Written in</strong>: Tcl</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets</strong>: this is not the fort of Tk. It has a <strong>small set</strong> of
default widgets, and misses important ones, for example a calendar. We
can find some in extensions (such as in <strong>Nodgui</strong>), but they don’t
feel native, at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interactive development</strong>: very much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical builder</strong>: no</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Other features</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>remote execution</strong>: the connection between Lisp and Tcl/Tk is
done via a stream. It is thus possible to run the Lisp program on
one computer, and to display the GUI on another one. The only
thing required on the client computer is tcl/tk installed and the
remote.tcl script. See <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/node46.html">Ltk-remote</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings documentation</strong>: short but complete. Nodgui too.</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: very stable</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: low to non-existent.</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: Tcl/Tk is BSD-style, Ltk is LGPL.</li>
  <li>Example applications:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://notabug.org/cage/fulci/">Fulci</a> - a program to organise your movie collections.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mijohnson99/ltk-small-games">Ltk small games</a> - snake and tic-tac-toe.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents">cl-torrents</a> - searching torrents on popular trackers. CLI, readline and a simple Tk GUI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>List of widgets</strong></p>

<p>(please don’t suppose the list is exhaustive)</p>

<pre><code>Button Canvas Check-button Entry Frame Label Labelframe Listbox
Menu Menubutton Message
Paned-window
Radio-button Scale
Scrollbar Spinbox Text
Toplevel Widget Canvas

Ltk-megawidgets:

<p>Nodgui adds:</p>

<pre><code>treelist tooltip searchable-listbox date-picker calendar autocomplete-listbox
password-entry progress-bar-star notify-window
dot-plot bar-chart equalizer-bar
swap-list
</code></pre>



<p>Do we need to present Qt and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/index.html">Qt4</a>? Qt is huge and contains
everything and the kitchen sink. Qt not only provides UI widgets, but
numerous other layers (networking, D-BUS…).</p>

<p>Qt is free for open-source software, however you’ll want to check the
conditions to ship proprietary ones.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools">Qtools</a> bindings target Qt4. The Qt5 Lisp bindings are
yet to be created.</p>

<p>A companion library for Qtools, that you’ll want to check out once you
made your first Qtool application, is
<a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools-ui">Qtools-ui</a>, a collection of
useful widgets and pre-made components. It comes with short

<h2 id="gtk3-cl-cffi-gtk">Gtk+3 (cl-cffi-gtk)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gtk.org/">Gtk+3</a> is the primary library used to build <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>
applications. Its (currently most advanced) lisp bindings is
<a href="https://github.com/Ferada/cl-cffi-gtk/">cl-cffi-gtk</a>. While primarily created for GNU/Linux, Gtk
works fine under macOS and can now also be used on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="iup-lispnikiup">IUP (lispnik/IUP)</h2>

<p><a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> is a cross-platform GUI toolkit actively developed
at the PUC university of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It uses <strong>native
controls</strong>: the Windows API for Windows, Gtk3 for GNU/Linux. At the
time of writing, it has a Cocoa port in the works (as well as iOS,
Android and WASM ones). A particularity of IUP is its <strong>small API</strong>.</p>

<p>The Lisp bindings are <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">lispnik/iup</a>. They are nicely
done in that they are automatically generated from the C sources. They
can follow new IUP versions with a minimal work and the required steps
are documented. All this gives us good guarantee over the bus
factor.</p>

<p>IUP stands as a great solution in between Tk and Gtk or Qt.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework written in</strong>: C (official API also in Lua and LED)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: Windows and Linux, work started for
Cocoa, iOS, Android, WASM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets choice</strong>: medium.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Other features</strong>: OpenGL, Web browser (WebKitGTK on GNU/Linux), plotting, Scintilla text editor</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings documentation</strong>: good examples and good readme, otherwise low.</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: alpha (but fully generated and working nicely).</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: low but steady, and reactive to new IUP versions.</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: IUP and the bindings are MIT licenced.</li>

<h2 id="nuklear-bodge-nuklear">Nuklear (Bodge-Nuklear)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> is a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI">immediate-mode</a> GUI toolkit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> is a minimal-state, immediate-mode graphical user interface toolkit written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies, a default render backend or OS window/input handling but instead provides a highly modular, library-based approach, with simple input state for input and draw commands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and render backends, it focuses only on the actual UI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>its Lisp binding is <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-nuklear">Bodge-Nuklear</a>, and its higher level companions <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-ui">bodge-ui</a> and <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-ui-window">bodge-ui-window</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional UI frameworks, Nuklear allows the developer to take
over the rendering loop or the input management. This might require
more setup, but it makes Nuklear particularly well suited for games,
or for applications where you want to create new controls.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework written in</strong>: ANSI C, single-header library.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: where C runs. Nuklear doesn’t contain
platform-specific code. No direct OS or window handling is done in
Nuklear. Instead <em>all input state has to be provided by platform
specific code</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets choice</strong>: small.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical builder</strong>: no.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Other features</strong>: fully skinnable and customisable.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: stable</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: active</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: MIT or Public Domain (unlicence).</li>
  <li>Example applications:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/borodust/trivial-gamekit">Trivial-gamekit</a></li>

<![CDATA[The Meddling Middlemen of Academia]]>

<br/>
July 13, 2020 | https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/middlemen/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One of the strangest phenomena in academia is the reliance on publishing
companies. In this article, I want to outline some of the issues that
arise when working with publishers. I shall also endeavour to provide
some solutions to improve this collaboration.</p>
<p>Before we start, a brief <strong>disclaimer</strong>: this article will use an
amalgamation of different incidents that involved either myself, my
colleagues, or my friends.  Names&nbsp;(of the publishing companies)
have been withheld because I do not think it fair to use my ‘soapbox’
without giving the <em>other</em> side a chance to respond. Moreover,
everything I write here pertains to publishing your research in
a journal. Conference publishing—at least in machine learning—is
a joy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Plus, there <em>are</em> good examples of journals for machine
learning papers, foremost of them the <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/">Journal of Machine Learning
Research</a>. The ‘adversaries’ in this article are
rather the ‘big’ publishing companies and their practices. With that out
of the way, let us take a look at the state of the art!</p>

<p>If you are new to science, at some point, you will probably have to deal
with an established publishing company to get your article published.
The deal usually works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You look for a journal you want to publish in and submit your article
to the journal. This already often involves jumping through some
hoops. Without knowing the eventual fate of your article, you often
already have to abide by certain arbitrary formatting guidelines or
completely ‘butcher’ your article for the submission<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> by shifting
content around. However, this can be all accepted and endured because
of course, you want something from <em>them</em>, i.e. a published,
citable publication!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The journal then receives your submission—often through a web
interface that was developed with all the UX/UI knowledge of the
1980s<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and has <em>never</em> been updated since—and this is where it gets
slightly <em>murky</em>. Another person—typically the editor of the
journal—now decides whether to accept the paper for reviewing, or
whether to provide you with a desk reject. A desk reject usually cannot
be appealed. It just shows you the door and leaves you to try again
with another journal&nbsp;(more murkiness here). For early-career
researchers like Ph.D. students submitting their first paper,
this can be highly discouraging. I see the reason for reducing the
workload on reviewers, of course, but I also heard of academic feuds
that were carried out on the backs of Ph.D. students and their
publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming your paper ‘survived’ the desk reject, it will now be sent
to reviewers or referees. Their job is to review your paper
thoroughly, provide feedback, and in general give this whole business
a formal veneer. Setting aside problems in the reviewing
process—which I discussed <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/reviewing/">in another blog post</a>—this again opens up a portal into
a strange dimension: working as a reviewer for a journal is usually
a job that is provided for free&nbsp;(same goes for editorial
duties). Notice that this is <em>despite</em> the fact that those journals
are charging money to readers and universities. ETH Zurich, my
current employer, describes their experiences of the <a href="https://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Services/Using-ordering-resources/National-negotiations-with-publishers-Read-publish-reorganised">negotiations
with
publishers</a>
and mentions an expenditure of 6.4 million EUR&nbsp;(roughly 7.25
million USD) per year for being allowed to access journal articles.
That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>Setting aside the actual numbers here, let me just point out how
strange it is that companies are relying on <em>unpaid labour</em>, and this
reliance is <em>crucial</em> to their business model. They often do not
employ people that are qualified to judge the content that they want
to publish! But of course, reviewers and editors get the benefit of
<em>exposure</em>—that wonderful currency that is supposed to help your
career along! Even stranger: journals often charge hefty sums for
accessing your own research articles. To me, it is super weird that
research that is often <em>funded</em> by the taxpayer cannot be <em>accessed</em>
by the taxpayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supposing your article got sufficiently good reviews to be published,
the next stage of the process starts. This is where the <em>meddling</em>
begins in earnest. After a little back and forth, you article will be
changed according to some arbitrary rules: the last period of every
sentence in an image caption will be removed, footnotes will be put
into the text—because for some reason, footnotes are permitted in
virtually every template and publishing medium, but deemed somewhat
uncouth by certain publishers—and you might have to redo certain
parts of your paper because of subtle font changes or what have you.</p>
<p>Again, lest you think of me as a particularly cranky person prone to
grumbling and finding faults, you are getting the wrong idea here.
I do not object to these changes, but I <em>do</em> object to the fact that
these meddlesome changes often decrease the quality of your paper.
Here are some irksome changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Footnotes will be inserted willy-nilly into the text, regardless of
whether they make sense or not. That might break the flow of your
paper, but that is <em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some ‘publisher house rules’ conflict with proper nomenclature in
a field. For example, the journal might have the ‘rule’ that all
fields in a table have to be capitalised. If this clashes with
nomenclature in your field, it is—you guessed it—<em>your</em> problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your equations will typically be typeset yet
another time for you<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which might introduce subtle changes: symbols
will change and you have to be go through your own paper once again
line-by-line to see whether anything untoward happened. Again, I am
primarily objecting to the substandard quality of this meddling:
the work that you put into writing your equations is completely
ignored, and now you have to chase—often very subtle—changes in
your own text. For mathematical typesetting, precision is crucial,
and it is unbecoming when people who do not <em>care</em> about this
precision create more work for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a last example, your figures might be meddled with: you might be
forced to convert them into obsolete file formats&nbsp;(because
apparently, EPS is still the best format available), or, more
appallingly, vector graphics might be converted to raster
images&nbsp;(judging from the experiences of my friends and myself,
this is unfortunately relatively common!). This might sound like a tiny
problem again, but it decreases readability and accessibility for
some readers, and, more to the point of this post, it is somewhat
unnecessary meddling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me re-iterate my main point: I do not object to changing my
paper, I merely object to meddlesome changes that are just generating
useless work. For example, there is no need whatsoever to typeset
your equations again—this is quite literally the definition of
negative work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you survived this ordeal intact, you now must <em>pay</em>. To be fair,
not all journals charge you for normal articles, but <em>most</em> of them
charge you for open access publishing. In other words: if I want my
research, which is generously funded<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> by the Swiss taxpayers, to
be available to those selfsame taxpayers, I have to pay. The amounts
vary a little bit, of course, but we are talking upwards of a few
hundred USD at least. Luckily, this is <em>not</em> a problem for my
research group; my postdoctoral adviser, <a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Prof. Karsten
Borgwardt</a> ensures that
sufficient funds for open access publications are available.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sometimes the cost is fielded by a conference; this
happens when the conference has a contract that ensures that its
publications will be available as special issue of some journal.
This might seem nice because it <em>shifts</em> the costs away from authors,
but it is also somewhat non-transparent; conference costs being high
already, I find it strange that some of the money goes into the
pockets of another party.</p>
<p>After all this negativity, it is time for a <em>positive example</em>:
NeurIPS, one of the flagship machine learning conferences, is
partnered with a publisher and makes <em>all</em> papers available for free
online. I <em>gladly</em> pay the conference fee for this!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>How can this process be improved? I have a few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: publishers should make it clear <em>where</em> the funds are
going. Are we increasing shareholder value by working for free? How
are profits split and used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Giving back</strong>: it is generally understood that everyone needs to eat
and no one should have to work for free. Why is then that this
completely different in publishing? Almost all the profits are
essentially generated because editors and reviewers work for free.
I know that being remunerated for your reviewing work might raise
some questions about impartiality etc., so I think <em>paying</em> people to
write reviews might be somewhat problematic.</p>
<p>However, closely related to my point about transparency, publishers
could be more upfront about how they user their funds and <em>give back</em>
to the community. For example, publishers could sponsor students so
that they can visit a conference for free, or publishers could
sponsor the conferences themselves.</p>
<p>If you, as a publisher, engage the community and give back a little,
the community will be all the more happy to work with you. We need
you, but you also need us. Without the scientists, you cannot be
a scientific publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commitment to excellence</strong>: publishers should commit to the highest
quality and the highest standards. Employ people that are capable of
working <em>with</em> the scientists, not <em>for</em> the scientists. Train your
employees to be experts in typography, typesetting, and pair them
with domain experts so that they do not create more work for the
authors by inadvertently destroying equations, figures, and so on.</p>
<p>This goal is not necessarily orthogonal to maximising your profits,
by the way: if you lower your standards, your reputation as
a publisher will suffer, meaning that scientists in the long
run&nbsp;(!) might not be willing to publish with you any more. If
you commit to excellence, by contrast, we will flock to you.</p>
<p>I know that working with a publisher that <em>cares</em> about the end
product as much as I do is a heavenly match! So we should endeavour
to make such …</p></li></ol></div></div>

This will definitely cause a major inconvenience, but the prospect of someone using your online banking logins to gain full access to your account is far more daunting.</p><p><a href="https://mk0privacyaffaidetc8.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-1040-e1590230436263.png"><img src="https://mk0privacyaffaidetc8.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-1040-e1590230436263.png" data-src="https://mk0privacyaffaidetc8.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-1040-e1590230436263.png" alt="Dark web credit card price" width="840" height="447"></a></p><p>Vendors tend to offer a guarantee of 80%. Meaning that two of every ten cards either won’t work or will have less than the advertised balance. We didn’t order any so can’t verify whether this is true, but the prevalence of these claims alongside the well documented increase in identity fraud cases suggests that there is a high turnover of such data.</p></section><section id="3"><h2>Payment processing services</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Product</td><td>&nbsp;Average dark web Price (USD)</td></tr><tr><td>Stolen PayPal account details, minimum $100</td><td>$198.56</td></tr><tr><td>PayPal transfer from stolen account, $1000 – $3000</td><td>$320.39</td></tr><tr><td>PayPal transfers from stolen account, $3000+</td><td>$155.94</td></tr><tr><td>Western Union transfer from stolen account, above $1000</td><td>$98.15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>PayPal account details were easily the most common items listed, and extremely cheap. More expensive was actual transfers from a hacked account.</p><p>Another very common item for sale was guides on how to “cash out” – actually get the money in a way that doesn’t alert the authorities. These guides go for a few cents, but whether or not they actually work is not what we were looking for.</p></section><section id="4"><h2>Forged documents</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Product</td><td>&nbsp;Average dark web Price (USD)</td></tr><tr><td>US driving license, average quality</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>US driving license, high quality</td><td>$550</td></tr><tr><td>Auto insurance card</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>AAA emergency road service membership card</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>Wells Fargo bank statement</td><td>$25</td></tr><tr><td>Wells Fargo bank statement with transactions</td><td>$80</td></tr><tr><td>Rutgers State University student ID</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>US, Canada, or Europe passport</td><td>$1500</td></tr><tr><td>Europe national ID card</td><td>$550</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These documents came with a range of guarantees and are available with any details the buyer chooses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>On the Gold Coast in January, Deb Goodkin from the FreeBSD Foundation began her Linux.conf.au talk with an intentionally-provocative slide: <em>FreeBSD, that’s just another Linux distro, right?</em> It was said in jest to highlight what a common misconception it is.</p>
<p>One way this manifests is through introductory FreeBSD guides online, usually on blogs with the words sysadmin, cookbook, or tutorial in their names; you know the ones I’m talking about. Invariably they advise updating the base system and pkgng, then immediately installing bash, nano, htop, lsof, coreutils, proc, and more. Some go as far as aliasing these over the built-in tools, and even setting bash as the root shell. From then on, you barely have to touch the FreeBSD userland.</p>
<p>Like a poorly-maintained cheese utensil, this used to grate. If you’re installing an entire GNU toolchain, why not use a Linux distribution, or Debian/kFreeBSD, or a Nexenta-like OS that’s built specifically for those tools? You’re not learning about FreeBSD’s features, nor are you taking advantage of any of its benefits beyond the kernel and base. It’s wasted opportunity, and could render future project contributions more difficult because of misunderstood assumptions about how the system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@2x.jpg 2x" alt="A photo of a pillow saying: Use BSD"></p>
<p>I’ve since changed my tune somewhat, with a caveat. I also want to take this opportunity— not a sponsor—to spruik Jay Patel’s <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jaypatelani/shop">RedBubble store</a> for your BSD laptop and loungeroom. I’ve already added some to next sticker batch.</p>
<p>What was I talking about?</p>
<p>We should be encouraging Linux people to try FreeBSD, and if giving them their familiar tooling gets their foot in the door, it’s worth it. I personally learn things the quickest by jumping in the deep end, but I know others want to take things a step at a time.</p>
<p>What also gets lost in the fray is FreeBSD, even with all those Linux-focused tools, is still a compelling and useful operating system. It’s a feature not a bug to be able to have all these tools available, and at times run them faster than Linux could on the same hardware. It may even integrate better into shops that otherwise entirely run Linux, given the motivation to write portable, POSIX-compliant code and applications is no longer a priority for most people (sadface).</p>
<p>So rather than saying those guides aren’t useful or even misrepresent FreeBSD, we need to reframe them. Instead of <em>introductions to FreeBSD</em>, say they’re <em>FreeBSD for Linux people</em>. This shouldn’t be constued as criticism; the latter kinds of post would be <em>hugely</em> useful. It’s also then easier to introduce BSD-specific tools and ideas, either inline after each Linuxism you introduce, or in a follow-up post where you compare and contrast.</p>
<p>We need more bridge-building and outreach between the two communities, and anything to make FreeBSD relatable to people coming from Linux, or any other operating system, is useful.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</p>
<p>I wanted something with a <em>little</em> more dynamism. </p>
<p>So that was the project: a small scope blog, where a few, already <em>trusted</em> users can make, edit, and post new pages in markdown (with a nice markdown editor courtesy of <a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a>). Additionally, I want a built in jank verison of imgur so I can satisfy my need to be self sufficient without going crazy.</p>
<p>So while I could whip something up in an afternoon with Django, I could also experiment with other languages. The project is simple enough that I can't imagine being too limited by any language's ecosystem. And I've been itching to write something substansive in Rust...</p>
<h3>Which framework?</h3>
<p>The biggest framework is probably <code>actix-web</code>. But</p>
<ol>
<li>When I was scoping out my options months ago, actix-web's maintainer quit with a bunch of drama</li>
<li>At least from what I could tell reading the docs, it seems more suited to APIs rather than servers serving templated HTML</li>
<li>With the above, I wanted this to be a weekend project, not a weekly project, so the more batteries included the better</li>
<li>I really don't want to figure out which async library is considered better. And note that with each async library, comes its own ecosystem of libraries, which only work with that async library, so it's a pretty hard decision to reverse after you made it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Rocket it is. </p>

<p>Something I didn't realize until I started scoping out this project is that on servers... the memory model is actually pretty simple! </p>
<p>Much of your state is just handled by your database. I <em>never</em> actually fought with the borrow checker. I never had to. For the most part, everything had exactly one owner, and exactly one lifetime: the function that's handling the request. </p>
<p>Rocket, too, has a surprising amount of "magic":</p>
<pre><code>#[get("/posts/&lt;slug&gt;/"]
pub fn post_view(slug: String) -&gt; Option&lt;Template&gt; {
    ...
		
    Some(Template::render("/posts/post", hashmap! { "post" =&gt; post}))
}
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to Flask's</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/posts/&lt;string:slug&gt;")
def post_view(slug):
    ...
		
    return render_template("posts/post.html", post=post)
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's macro system has really impressed me so far. Not only is there a shocking amount of "just works", but it's all statically typed and compiled.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to Rocket is flask + all the flask adjacent libraries (SQLAlchemy-flask, etc). Rocket, through the power of 3rd party integrations, comes with two template engines (handlebars, and Tera, which is basically Jinja2), database pooling support for quite a few ORMs/DB drivers, and more.</p>
<p>It's still at the point where you have to roll your own auth, though.</p>
<p>While I've heard comparisons to Django/Rails, it doesn't really seem like they're going that direction. Django/Rails purposefully put you, the developer, on the metaphorical rails, dictating best practices from everything from where the files go, to how you update your models and views. Rocket doesn't do that, and I'm not sure it should ever.</p>
<p>I also had, for the most part, the experience that "if it compiles, it works". Most of my runtime errors were in the templates, which incidentally is the only thing that's not statically typed. </p>
<p>I guess that's really what surprised me. For a lot of it, "it just works"! There's not a lot of boilerplate syntax, type inference keeps your functions clean, and I didn't write a <em>single</em> lifetime annotation at any point. My rust server really didn't look that different from my flask server, or my Django server, and honestly it looks cleaner than my Java server. All with no garbage collector or runtime.</p>

<p>Next, I'll talk about Diesel, which as far as I can see, is the most mature ORM available. While I do have my gripes, it's not really anything "objectively" bad. I suppose it's more on tradeoffs, and Diesel chooses to go light on the magic. </p>
<p>For one, it's annoying to make two structs for each table. You need one to represent the table, and one to insert with (with any autogenerated columns like the primary key removed). For instance, I have</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Identifiable, Queryable, Associations, PartialEq, Debug, Serialize)]
#[belongs_to(BlogPosts, foreign_key="post_id")]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct Tag {
    id: i32,
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct InsertTag {
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, while in some ORMs you write your table models, and the ORM generates your SQL migrations, in Diesel, you write your SQL migrations by hand, and the ORM generates a <code>schema.rs</code> file that contains the mappings. I actually don't mind that one too much.</p>
<p>Diesel also only supports parent-child relationships, and you have to be quite explicit. There's no magic field on your parent, that magically gives you a list of its children. No, you just have to write the query and call it. In some sense it's more like using a slightly fancier query builder.</p>
<p>Dipping down from that level of magic, it's not really a <em>bad</em> thing per se. By being explicit, you prevent users from believing too much in that magic, and shooting themselves in the foot, like N+1 selects. </p>
<p>But I'm not going to say it didn't slow me down quite a bit, either. And to be honest, writing joins was a humongous pain in the ass. Maybe that's how it should be, but maybe that also caused a generation of NoSQL databases. 🤷</p>

<p>Here's how you upload an image in flask</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/images/upload')
def upload_file():
	files = request.files['file']
	if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the "simpler" example, while using a <em>third party library in addition</em> from abonader</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abonander/multipart/blob/master/examples/rocket.rs"><strong>See the whole thing here</strong></a></p>
<pre><code>#[post("/upload", data = "&lt;data&gt;")]
// signature requires the request to have a `Content-Type`
fn multipart_upload(cont_type: &amp;ContentType, data: Data) -&gt; Result&lt;Stream&lt;Cursor&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;&gt;, Custom&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    // this and the next check can be implemented as a request guard but it seems like just
    // more boilerplate than necessary
    if !cont_type.is_form_data() {
        return Err(Custom(
            Status::BadRequest,
            "Content-Type not multipart/form-data".into()
        ));
    }

    let (_, boundary) = cont_type.params().find(|&amp;(k, _)| k == "boundary").ok_or_else(
            || Custom(
                Status::BadRequest,
                "`Content-Type: multipart/form-data` boundary param not provided".into()
            )
        )?;

    match process_upload(boundary, data) {
        Ok(resp) =&gt; Ok(Stream::from(Cursor::new(resp))),
        Err(err) =&gt; Err(Custom(Status::InternalServerError, err.to_string()))
    }
}

fn process_upload(boundary: &amp;str, data: Data) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    let mut out = Vec::new();

    // saves all fields, any field longer than 10kB goes to a temporary directory
    // Entries could implement FromData though that would give zero control over
    // how the files are saved; Multipart would be a good impl candidate though
    match Multipart::with_body(data.open(), boundary).save().temp() {
        Full(entries) =&gt; process_entries(entries, &amp;mut out)?,
        Partial(partial, reason) =&gt; {
            writeln!(out, "Request partially processed: {:?}", reason)?;
            if let Some(field) = partial.partial {
                writeln!(out, "Stopped on field: {:?}", field.source.headers)?;
            }

            process_entries(partial.entries, &amp;mut out)?
        },
        Error(e) =&gt; return Err(e),
    }

    Ok(out)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to be fair, Rocket is in version 0.4.5. From <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/106"><strong>this github issue</strong></a>, multipart form support is coming in 0.5.0. But it doesn't change the fact that right now, the current libraries are somewhat immature still. They lack some of the edge features, especially for more traditional web servers that serve templated HTML, as opposed to pure API servers, or an SPA. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rust's errors are quite good, usually. But that's before you get into, well, libraries that try to do a bit more. I ran into some... interesting error messages, mostly from macros in Rocket and Diesel. Take a look at this one, for instance.</p>
<pre><code>the trait bound `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32): diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not satisfied

<p>A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to “jump around”.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia</a>. Wouldn’t it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

<p>Feel like making a bookmarklet of this or something? <a href="https://github.com/geon/geon.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-03-03-dsxyliea.md">Fork it</a> on github.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one’s expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>How is your startup sharing knowledge with the rest of your team?
We’ve been using slack’s <code>#general</code> or <code>#random</code> channels to make announcements.
We regularly post documents and PPTs slack channels so that they can be used by other people. We have a channel called <code>#setup</code> to post all IT related information like how to login to VPN etc.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, these docs/notes become super hard to find. As good slack’s search is, you have to precisely know what you’re looking for. What we needed was a centralized knowledge base website - something like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a></p>

<p>But Confluence is clunky and slow, and not cheap ($5/user). We experimented with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It calls itself ‘a non-linear personal web notebook’. It’s an opensource software which you can host on your servers or AWS. But its non linear organization makes it super unintuitive and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="why-outline">Why Outline?</h2>

<p>Then, I found <a href="https://www.getoutline.com/">outline</a>! Outline is similar to TiddlyWiki in that it’s opensource and free to self-host. Its UI is a great balance between simplicity of plain text notes and feature creep of Confluence. Login to outline is through your slack - so one less password to remember (or save). You can create private notebooks for a team or just for yourself. You can create a public link of a note so that you can share it with people outside your team - say via email.</p>

<p><span>
    Outline has great UI
</span>
<img src="https://www.getoutline.com/images/screenshot.png"></p>

<p>Best part of all of this is that <em>data doesn’t leave your servers</em> if you self-host it!
We already have a server lying around on AWS to host our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index">python package server, pypi</a>. Since neither hosting pypi nor hosting outline are particularly intensive, we’ve hosted outline on this machine as <code>wiki.qure.ai</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-outline">Install Outline</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, documentation for self-hosting outline is limited. There’s no robust docker-compose avaialable that you can use to directly create your server. In the rest of this post, I’ll show you how to host in your laptop or server. Before starting, make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chsasank/outline-wiki-docker-compose.git
cd outline-wiki-docker-compose
make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><span>
    make install
</span>
<img src="http://chsasank.github.io/assets/images/outline/make_install.png"></p>

<p>Follow the instructions. You’ll have to create a slack app.

							<p><span><a href="https://words.usask.ca/helus/2018/03/27/uncleftish-beholding/#comments">Jump to Comments</a></span></p><p><strong>Alexei Muzyka</strong></p>

<p>Many English words are directly borrowed from, or take influence from many other languages. Loanwords can fill lexical gaps, increase the ways people can say what they want to, and increase the precision of communication in a language. English has borrowed so many foreign words that it might seem impossible that the complex ideas of today’s world could be communicated without loans. However, doing so can show one where English receives new words from, which languages contribute heavily to certain word categories, and how loans are more helpful than harmful.</p>

<p>The practice of removing loans form English is known as by many names like: Pure Anglo-Saxon, or, informally, Anglish (Hofstadter 218). For consistency I will refer to it as Anglish throughout. This form of English seek to eliminate as many non-English, or non-Germanic words as possible from the lexicon and replace them with English or Germanic equivalents. An example of this is the following text, <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/complexity/people/students/dtc/students2011/maitland/fun/">“Uncleftish Beholding” by Poul Anderson</a>, which aims to explain a complex scientific topic using Anglish (below is the first and last part of the text)(Anderson):</p>
<blockquote><p>For most of its being, mankind did not know what things are made of, but could only guess. With the growth of worldken, we began to learn, and today we have a beholding of stuff and work that watching bears out, both in the workstead and in daily life.</p>

<p>The underlying kinds of stuff are the *firststuffs*, which link together in sundry ways to give rise to the rest. Formerly we knew of ninety-two firststuffs, from waterstuff, the lightest and barest, to ymirstuff, the heaviest. Now we have made more, such as aegirstuff and helstuff.</p>

<p>The firststuffs have their being as motes called *unclefts*. These are mightly small; one seedweight of waterstuff holds a tale of them like unto two followed by twenty-two naughts. Most unclefts link together to make what are called *bulkbits*. Thus, the waterstuff bulkbit bestands of two waterstuff unclefts, the sourstuff bulkbit of two sourstuff unclefts, and so on. (Some kinds, such as sunstuff, keep alone; others, such as iron, cling together in ices when in the fast standing; and there are yet more yokeways.) When unlike clefts link in a bulkbit, they make *bindings*. Thus, water is a binding of two waterstuff unclefts with one sourstuff uncleft, while a bulkbit of one of the forestuffs making up flesh may have a thousand thousand or more unclefts of these two firststuffs together with coalstuff and chokestuff…</p>

<p>Today we wield both kind of uncleftish doings in weapons, and kernelish splitting gives us heat and bernstoneness. We hope to do likewise with togethermelting, which would yield an unhemmed wellspring of work for mankindish goodgain.</p>

<p>Soothly we live in mighty years!</p></blockquote>
<p>Much of this text sounds silly and almost incomprehensible at some points, but upon closer inspection the words that are substituted seem like plausible replacements. Starting with the title “Uncleftish Beholding” is, according to Anderson’s translation, the Anglish equivalent of <em>atomic theory</em>; <em>uncleft</em> meaning unsplittable (<em>atom</em> meaning “indivisible” in Greek) and <em>beholding</em> meaning “to see” (<em>theory</em> meaning “contemplation”<em>, </em>or “spectator” in Greek) (OED s.v <em>atomic</em>, adj, and n. <em>Theory</em>, n). Some more words that are important in the text are: <em>Worldken</em> (meaning “physics”, <em>world </em>“nature” + <em>ken </em>“perception”), <em>firststuff</em> (meaning “element”, <em>first </em>“principle/ fundamental” + <em>stuff </em>“part”), <em>mote</em> (meaning “particle”), <em>kernel </em>(meaning “nucleus”, “nut/ inner part”), and <em>waterstuff </em>(meaning “hydrogen”, <em>water </em>+ <em>stuff </em>“born from/ component”) (OED s.v <em>physics, </em>n, sense 1a<em>. Element, n, </em>sense 1c<em>. Nucleus, </em>n, sense 8<em>. Hydrogen, </em>n, sense a). Also, looking at the context of the words later in the text can show their meaning. For example the sentence says that “Water is a binding of two waterstuff unclefts with one sourstuff uncleft,” which reveals that waterstuff is hydrogen and sourstuff is oxygen, since 2 hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom make water.</p>
<p>This text can tell one about what English words might be used if we did not have foreign loans, but more importantly why certain words are used, and how they came into English. Many of the replaced words have roots in Greek and Latin, but do not reach the English lexicon directly from those languages. Instead many technical vocabulary that is originally from those two languages arrives through the French language (Durkin 307). An example is the previously mentioned <em>hydrogen</em> (<em>waterstuff</em>). It comes from the French <em>hydrogène</em>, which itself is made from the Greek <em>ὕδωρ</em> (<em>ýdor</em> “water”), and <em>γενής </em>(<em>genís</em> “born from”) (OED s.v, <em>Hydrogen, </em>n, sense a). This is due to scientists still using Latin and sometimes Greek as languages of science throughout Europe during the time these discoveries were being made (Durkin 341). This is also seen as a spike in the influx of Latin and Greek words, along with technical vocabulary into English around the same time (Durkin 309). Texts like “Uncleftish Beholding” show clearly which languages contribute which kind of words. One would expect French to occupy prestige and fashion words, because of its historic relation to England (Durkin, 307). Looking at this text it is clear that Latin and Greek influence lies in the realm of technical and scientific vocabulary. That is not to say that Latin only contributes technical vocabulary; it contributes other words like <em>family, involve,</em> or <em>produce</em> (Márquez 712). These scientific words, like <em>hydrogen, oxygen,</em> and many others, are very important since they filled lexical gaps that English had.</p>
<p>English is known for its robbery from the lexicons of other languages, but this is not a bad thing. Loanwords improve the precision of speech by providing more options to say one thing by filling lexical gaps. At this stage in the history of English the attempt to remove these words would only do more harm than good. Pieces of literature like “Uncleftish Beholding”, however, provide insight into where loans come from and what we would lose if they were given up. Although it would be possible to throw away all loans the benefits that come with them are too valuable to give up.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In JavaScript, you can create random numbers using <code>Math.random()</code>. But what if we wanted to create our own random values in the browser without this function?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-math.random">ECMAScript Language Specification</a> defines the requirements of <code>Math.random()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns a Number value with positive sign, greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1, chosen randomly or pseudo randomly with approximately uniform distribution over that range, using an implementation-dependent algorithm or strategy. This function takes no arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Math.random function created for distinct realms must produce a distinct sequence of values from successive calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="number-generation"><a href="#number-generation" aria-label="number generation permalink"></a>Number Generation</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of a number generator. It uses a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closure</a> to maintain internal state and creates a sequence of numbers based off an initial seed value. Here the seed is fixed and is always initialized to <code>0</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Math<span>.</span>random <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>A <strong>pseudorandom number generator</strong> (PRNG) works in a similar manner. A PRNG maintains an internal state and applies math to that state every time a new random number is requested. The seed can be manual or automatic. In the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#New">Go programming language</a>, you must seed <code>math/rand</code> yourself. In the browser, <code>Math.random</code> requests random data under the hood from the operating system (OS) to use as a seed.</p>
<p>PRNGs are deterministic. The same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Often, a deterministic outcome is preferred. For example, to generate the same random events on all clients without them having to talk over a network. Or for reproducible performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>A hash function can be used to create a PRNG. In <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/4b9b23521e6fd42373ebbcb20ebe03bf445494f9/benchmarks/spinning-balls/v.js">spinning-balls</a>, one of Chrome’s benchmarks, we can see an example of this:</p>

<p>Like our number generator, it alters its internal state while calculating the next random number. This state-change allows the next call to produce a different number.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-pseudorandom-number-generators"><a href="#more-on-pseudorandom-number-generators" aria-label="more on pseudorandom number generators permalink"></a>More on Pseudorandom Number Generators</h2>
<p>One of the oldest and most well known types of PRNG is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG). Which, despite its somewhat scary name, does not require many lines of code.</p>
<p>@bryc provides an example and <a href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md#lcg-lehmer-rng">a warning</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commonly called a Linear congruential generator (LCG), but in this case, more correctly called a Multiplicative congruential generator (MCG) or Lehmer RNG. It has a state and period of 2^31-1. It’s blazingly fast in JavaScript (likely the fastest), but its quality is quite poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>LCG</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(This is the first time I’ve come across <code>Math.imul()</code> — which provides <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/imul#Description">C-like 32-bit multiplication</a> of the two parameters.)</p>
<p>What does @bryc’s comment, “its quality is quite poor” mean in this context? Well, given certain even seeds, this algorithm has a pattern when the final step (the division) is removed.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>






<span>const</span> <span>LCG</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>s <span>=</span> Math<span>.</span><span>imul</span><span>(</span><span>48271</span><span>,</span> s<span>)</span> <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">many</a> ways to test the quality of randomness. Some of the methodology and results of these tests can be understood by a layperson. One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">Diehard battery of tests</a> plays 200000 games of craps and looks at the distribution of wins and the number of throws each game.</p>
<p>There’s also a test for LCGs called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_test">spectral test</a> which plots the sequence in two or more dimensions. In the example below, we can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplanes</a> that the spectral test measures for.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/940b3280e30ebce96af63d654d461af46f2afc28/26139/9e8cfab758735e8c6d06f733460f6a3f/lcg-3d.gif" alt="Hyperplanes of an LCG in three dimensions"></p>
</center>
<p>A PRNG eventually repeats its sequence. In this context, the <em>period</em> is the length of steps until the cycle repeats. Simpler PRNGs such as <a href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md#mulberry32">Mulberry32</a> have a period as low as ~4 billion whereas the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38838863">Mersenne Twister</a> has a period of <code>2^19,937 - 1</code>. In 2015, the V8 team <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/math-random">said</a> that their implementation of <code>Math.random()</code> uses an algorithm called <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshiftplus.pdf">xorshift128+</a> which has a period of <code>2^128 - 1</code>. Its introduction can been seen in <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/085fed0fb5c3b0136827b5d7c190b4bd1c23a23e/src/base/utils/random-number-generator.h#L102">this diff</a>.</p>
<p>If a PRNG eventually repeats itself, you might wonder why we call it repeatedly. Why not use the first number and then reset the internal state with a new seed? The problem with this is that the seed needs to originate from somewhere. If we continue to ask the OS for more random data there is a chance that the call may block (as the OS waits for more randomness to be generated) and our program will stall.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-required"><a href="#entropy-required" aria-label="entropy required permalink"></a>Entropy Required</h2>
<p>So you’ve settled on a PRNG and replaced <code>window.Math.random</code>. You’ve shipped it to your users and, at first, everyone seems to be happy.</p>
<p>But wait! You forgot about the seed. And now your users are complaining about the sequence of random numbers they get. It’s the same every time their customers’ page loads. All of their software is predictable. As a result, the web games they built are easy to beat.</p>
<p>Huzaifa Sidhpurwala <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-random-number-generators-and-their-limitations-linux">reminds us</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropy is the measurement of uncertainty or disorder in a system. Good entropy comes from the surrounding environment which is unpredictable and chaotic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When required, the generation of securely random numbers in the browser is performed by <code>Crypto.getRandomValues()</code> from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#Crypto-method-getRandomValues">Web Cryptography API</a>. Which is seeded by “a platform-specific random number function, the Unix <code>/dev/urandom</code> device, or other source of random or pseudorandom data.”</p>
<p>The Linux <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/char/random.c">source</a> suggests where this pseudorandom data can come from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an outside observer to measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also hardware devices that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#Quantum_random_properties">quantum mechanical physical randomness</a>.</p>
<p>You can find many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack#Prominent_examples">prominent examples</a> of random number generator attacks which occurred because the wrong type (or not enough) entropy was used. Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/">famously</a> uses lava lamps as an entropy source. Since we are not attempting to create a secure algorithm, predictable sources of entropy like time are fine.</p>
<p>We can use <code>Date.now()</code> our seed state. This means that we will get a different random sequence for every millisecond. We could also use <code>performance.now()</code> which returns the length of time since the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin">time origin</a>.</p>
<p>Other possible ways of getting entropy in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crypto.getRandomValues</code>, <code>crypto</code> key generation, or similar (feels like cheating)</li>
<li>Mouse/touch events, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Ambient_Light_Events">ambient light events</a>, mic/webcam noise (hard to use on page load)</li>
<li>Geolocation API, Bluetooth API, or similar (need permission, doesn’t work on page load)</li>
<li>WebGL/video performance shenanigans</li>
<li>Most APIs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">listed here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s our slower (because it’s not native code) and unstable (because I haven’t tested it) replacement for <code>Math.random()</code>. Also note that PRNGs have requirements for the seed state (e.g. prime numbers, 128-bit). Our algorithm doesn’t comply with the <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf">seed recommendations</a> for the Xoshiro family.</p>

<h2 id="so-mission-accomplished"><a href="#so-mission-accomplished" aria-label="so mission accomplished permalink"></a>So, Mission Accomplished?</h2>
<p>Sadly it’s impossible to create a fully ECMAScript compliant replacement for <code>Math.random()</code> since the specification requires “distinct realms [to] produce a distinct sequence of values from successive calls.” A <em>realm</em> roughly means a different global environment (e.g. a different window, or a different <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">WebWorker</a>). Our version cannot reach outside its realm thus cannot make this guarantee.</p>
<p>However, there have been proposals for a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms">Realms API</a>. It’s not inconceivable that such an API would provide access to something like an incrementing realm id. This would give our algorithm the loophole it needs — access to Realm-unique entropy!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Supervised learning is the machine learning branch that deals with function approximation: using several input-output pairs generated by an unknown target function, construct a different function that approximates the target function. For example, the target function may be my personal movie preferences, and we might be interested in obtaining a model that can predict (approximately) how much I will enjoy watching some new movie. With such a model we can create a movie recommendation app.</p>

<p>Some functions can be easier to approximate than others (given a definition of approximation difficulty, but I won’t go down that rabbit hole right now), and some tasks can be framed as more than one function. This raises the question - do different framings result in different model performance? To find out I tried playing with two framings of a toy problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#olivetti-faces-dataset">Olivetti faces dataset</a>, which contains grayscale, 64x64 images of the faces of 40 subjects (10 images per subject). Here are some of the faces:
<img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/faces_sample.png" alt="Face data sample"></p>

<h2 id="the-task">The task</h2>
<p>The task is the classical face recognition task (which has been quite controversial lately due to questionable use in settings such as law enforcement). To make things more interesting, I decided to use only two images from each subject for training, and the rest as the test set. So the goal is to train a model which, given an image, outputs the subject that the model believes this face belongs to.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>I wanted to focus just on the aspects of training that pertain to the problem framing, and treat it as a general problem. For that purpose I excluded many specifics that would be very important for a real face recognition application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using existing face recognition models or <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html">existing techniques specific to face recognition</a></li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0">data augmentation</a> to generate more training samples</li>
  <li>Obtaining more face data (even without subject information) and perform unsupervised pre-training</li>
  <li>Assigning each prediction a confidence score, and fixing a confidence threshold below which no result is reported</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I wanted to see what difference just changing the target function would make. Since the functions are different the models may be somewhat different as well, but they are trained on the same (base) data.</p>

<h3 id="performance-metric">Performance metric</h3>
<p>To measure model performance, I used the accuracy metric - percentage of correct classifications. For each framing I ran about 100 train/test splits (with two images in the training set and eight in the test set).</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>
<p>As a baseline I used a (single) nearest neighbor classifier with the L2 norm. I.e. when classifying a new face, for each face in the training set we calculate the sum of the squared differences bewteen every two pixels (in similar positions), and take as the answer the face that was closest.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/faces_knn.png" alt="Nearest neighbor face classification"></p>

<p>Intuitively it’s hard to tell how well this model would fare. On one hand there should obviously be many similarities between images of the same person (including factors 
we would have liked to exclude, such as lighting and clothing).
On the other hand, many of the similarities we perceive in faces will not be reflected in the pixel-level comparison.
In this case the performance (measured as accuracy - percent of correct classifications) of the model was about  <strong>70.5%</strong>, which is quite impressive in my opinion, considering that a random model would achieve about 2.5% accuracy on average.</p>

<p>Let’s see how a more sophisticated model fares.</p>

<h2 id="first-approach">First approach</h2>
<p>The first framing is the explicit one: given an image, we want to know whose face it is, so that’s what we’ll ask the model. The function maps images to subject identifiers.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/first_approach.png" alt="Mapping image to subject ID"></p>

<p>For the model I used a simple network with Keras:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>128</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>),</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>

		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>64</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>

		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>y_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>
	<span>])</span>

<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>loss</span><span>=</span><span>'categorical_crossentropy'</span><span>,</span> <span>optimizer</span><span>=</span><span>'adam'</span><span>)</span>
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>,</span> <span>epochs</span><span>=</span><span>1200</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I played with several variations and this seemed to be the best with regards to number of layers, their sizes and activation functions. Its test accuracy was, on average, about <strong>70.9%</strong> - an ever so slight improvement.
I think part of the challenge is that classifying faces requires relatively complex features, but we have very little training data (especially considering the number of positive instances for each class).
So the model either fails to find a pattern if the network is too small, or overfits if it’s too large.</p>

<h2 id="second-approach">Second approach</h2>
<p>Let’s try a less direct framing. We know that if two images belong to the same person, they should be relatively similar, and vice versa. Therefore, instead of training the model to identify faces, we can train the model to <em>compare</em> faces. In this case, instead of 40 classes (one for every subject) we only have two classes: “same person” or “not the same person”.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/second_approach.png" alt="Mapping image pairs to similarity"></p>

<p>Training this model was a little trickier:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The best architecture turned out to be pretty similar to two (“sideways”) concatenations of the first approach model, which I thought was pretty neat.</li>
  <li>Due to a vanishing gradients issue, I had to go with a slower learning rate and slow it even more as the loss decreased.</li>
  <li>This time we have an <em>imbalanced</em> classification task, so I gave the positive class a bigger weight.</li>
  <li>Training took longer and in a handful of cases (about 5 out of 100) didn’t converge and needed restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another difference is that using this framing, inference isn’t straightforward. Instead, we run the model on the input image along with each of the training images, and pick the subject of the image that the model deemed most similar to the input image.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the model and training:</p>

<p>The accuracy of this model was, on average, about <strong>74.4%</strong>, which is an improvement over both the first approach and the baseline. However, the spread of the results was larger, resulting in both much worse and much better runs. In this problem, a different framing made quite a significant difference.</p>

<h2 id="combined-approach">Combined approach</h2>
<p>After seeing the better average but also bigger spread of the second approach I wondered if it would be possible to create a model that optimizes for both using a non-linear computation graph.
The idea was this: each input sample would contain two faces, which would each “go through” several dense layers. The images would be transformed by the same layers separately, and the resulting representation would be used in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Classify each face</li>
  <li>Concatenate the two representations and, after several more dense layers, classify whether or not they belong to the same person</li>
</ol>

<p>I also used different weights for the two framings, which worked a little better.</p>

<p>Here’s a visual description of what’s happening:</p>

<p>This model took the longest to train. The average accuracy was <strong>73.3%</strong>, better than the baseline and the first approach but not as good as the second; however, it was much more stable and there were no incidents of non-convergence. So it seems like the combination indeed enabled us to enjoy both worlds: a little better performance while preserving stability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Machine-aided programming tools such as type predictors and code summarizers are increasingly learning-based. However, most code representation learning approaches rely on supervised learning with task-specific annotated datasets.
                    We propose <em>Contrastive Code Representation Learning (ContraCode)</em>, a self-supervised algorithm for learning task-agnostic semantic representations of programs via contrastive learning. Our approach uses no human-provided labels, relying only on the raw text of programs.
                    In particular, we design an unsupervised pretext task by generating textually divergent copies of source functions via automated source-to-source compiler transforms that preserve semantics.
                    We train a neural model to identify variants of an anchor program within a large batch of negatives. To solve this task, the network must extract program features representing the functionality, not form, of the program.
                    This is the first application of instance discrimination to code representation learning to our knowledge. We pre-train models over 1.8m unannotated JavaScript methods mined from GitHub. ContraCode pre-training improves code summarization accuracy by 7.9% over supervised approaches and 4.8% over RoBERTa pre-training.
                    Moreover, our approach is agnostic to model architecture; for a type inference task, contrastive pre-training consistently improves the accuracy of existing baselines.

                <h2>Compiler transforms for code data augmentation</h2>
                <p>Finding equivalent programs in a dataset is challenging. In computer vision, random crops of a source image are frequently used as "equivalent" views of it for augmenting training sets or for unsupervised pre-training. However, it's challenging to define similar data augmentations for natural and programming languages. We propose to use <em>automated source-to-source compiler transformations</em> to generate augmentations of programs that preserve functionality. These transforms include dead code elimination, variable renaming and constant folding. We also explore lossy transforms like code deletion that only preserve some of the program semantics.
                <br></p>

The equivalent programs were automatically generated through compiler transformations, serving as "augmentations" or "views" of the original program.</em></p></div>

                <h2>Contrastive pre-training</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrastive Code Representation Learning (ContraCode) is a pretext representation learning task that uses these code augmentations to construct a challenging <em>discriminative</em> pretext task that requires the model to identify equivalent programs out of a large dataset of distractors. 
                    In doing so, it has to embed the functionality, not form, of the code. 
                    In essence, the domain knowledge from our code transformations induces the knowledge of the structure of programs onto learned representations.

                <h2>Finetuning on downstream tasks</h2>
                <p>
                    By learning functionality-based representations, a model pre-trained with ContraCode outperforms baselines that are are trained from scratch or pre-trained with reconstruction objectives like masked language modeling. We demonstrate these improvements by finetuning LSTM and Transformer models on type inference and code summarization tasks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we would like to compress one or several files into one zipped file or decompress a zipped file. It is very common to use tools such as gzip, zip, or 7zip to create or decompress <code>.gz</code>, <code>.zip</code>, and <code>.7z</code> files, respectively. However, none of these tools on Linux uses multicore and multithread during compression and decompression. When the number of files are large or the file sizes are large, compression and decompression would take a lot of time using single thread.</p>



<p>Pigz is one of the parallel implementation for gzip and zip. Using pigz could greatly save us the time spent on compression and decompression. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss how to use pigz.</p>

<h3 id="pigz">Pigz</h3>

<p>The pigz usages in the blog post are mainly targeted for Ubuntu systems. However, its usages on other Linux operating systems should be almost the same.</p>

<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>pigz
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="pigz-usages">Pigz Usages</h4>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pigz --help
Usage: pigz [options] [files ...]
  will compress files in place, adding the suffix '.gz'. If no files are
  specified, stdin will be compressed to stdout. pigz does what gzip does,
  but spreads the work over multiple processors and cores when compressing.

Options:
  -0 to -9, -11        Compression level (level 11, zopfli, is much slower)
  --fast, --best       Compression levels 1 and 9 respectively
  -b, --blocksize mmm  Set compression block size to mmmK (default 128K)
  -c, --stdout         Write all processed output to stdout (won't delete)
  -d, --decompress     Decompress the compressed input
  -f, --force          Force overwrite, compress .gz, links, and to terminal
  -F  --first          Do iterations first, before block split for -11
  -h, --help           Display a help screen and quit
  -i, --independent    Compress blocks independently for damage recovery
  -I, --iterations n   Number of iterations for -11 optimization
  -J, --maxsplits n    Maximum number of split blocks for -11
  -k, --keep           Do not delete original file after processing
  -K, --zip            Compress to PKWare zip (.zip) single entry format
  -l, --list           List the contents of the compressed input
  -L, --license        Display the pigz license and quit
  -m, --no-time        Do not store or restore mod time
  -M, --time           Store or restore mod time
  -n, --no-name        Do not store or restore file name or mod time
  -N, --name           Store or restore file name and mod time
  -O  --oneblock       Do not split into smaller blocks for -11
  -p, --processes n    Allow up to n compression threads (default is the
                       number of online processors, or 8 if unknown)
  -q, --quiet          Print no messages, even on error
  -r, --recursive      Process the contents of all subdirectories
  -R, --rsyncable      Input-determined block locations for rsync
  -S, --suffix .sss    Use suffix .sss instead of .gz (for compression)
  -t, --test           Test the integrity of the compressed input
  -v, --verbose        Provide more verbose output
  -V  --version        Show the version of pigz
  -Y  --synchronous    Force output file write to permanent storage
  -z, --zlib           Compress to zlib (.zz) instead of gzip format
  --                   All arguments after "--" are treated as files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A typical command for compressing and decompressing a file is like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span># Always use -k to keep the original file</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> image.png
<span># Decompress</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-dk</span> <span>-p8</span> image.gz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, vanilla pigz is not very friendly to compressing multiple files into one single file and custom output filepath. We would need to rely on tar, the archive tool.</p>

<h4 id="tar-pigz-usages">Tar-Pigz Usages</h4>

<p>Using pipe <code>|</code>, we could first archive multiple files or directories first to <code>.tar</code> file and compress using pigz to further generate <code>.tar.gz</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-cf</span> - data/ index.json | pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> <span>&gt;</span> dataset.tar.gz
<span># Decompress (Unfortunately two steps)</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> dataset.tar.gz
<span># Extract file to another directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> new_dataset
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> dataset.tar <span>-C</span> new_dataset
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, tar has already integrated custom compressor in its interface, which makes the command looks more clear.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--use-compress-program</span><span>=</span><span>"pigz -k -p8"</span> <span>-cf</span> dataset.tar.gz data/ index.json
<span># Extract file to another directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> new_dataset
<span># Decompress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--use-compress-program</span><span>=</span><span>"pigz -dk -p8"</span> <span>-xf</span> dataset.tar.gz <span>-C</span> new_dataset
</code></pre></div></div>

          <h4>Server side, client optimized</h4>
          <p>Wt employs a signal-slot system. Instead of worrying about the sending of Ajax requests and serving of pages, you can simply connect the click of a button to a callback function on the server.

    Wt will use whatever technology available for communication: Ajax or WebSockets, but will fall back on full HTML
    page loads when JavaScript is unavailable. This makes Wt applications accessible to any browser or web crawler.

          <h4>Built-in security</h4>
          <p>
    Wt automatically protects against misuse by only allowing visible and enabled widgets to be interacted with.
    This also helps to avoid CSRF attacks, which are doubly avoided because Wt does not store session information in cookies.
    By using the widget abstraction, Wt discourages the inserting of raw HTML into a web page, preventing XSS attacks.
    
      Wt::Dbo prevents SQL injection by encouraging the use of prepared statements when accessing the database.
    
    Wt also includes an authentication and registration system with support for OAuth
    providers like Google, Facebook, and OpenID Connect.

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

			<h2>Why 65C02?</h2>
			
			</a><p><a name="Why6502">
				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.
			</p>

			<a name="TheLanguages">
			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.
			</p>

			<a name="TheGame">
			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Lets be frank, the Internet is simply unusable with all the ads floating around.</p><p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uBlock Origin</a> extension in my browser, as do most of the people reading this genre of articles, but the same is not true for the majority of the population, including other members of my family. So in order to enhance their web browsing experience I decided to block ads at the DNS level.</p><p>But why stop there I thought, why not also improve their privacy while I'm at it. So I also decided to setup a VPN. Now let me clarify some things here, I'm not a big fan of VPNs, the way they're advertised by the big companies, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great video by Tom Scott</a> explaining what I mean. But they also have their use cases, some of which are:</p><ul><li>Prohibiting ISPs from collecting data on my browsing patterns</li><li>Circumvent internet censorship</li><li>Connect to my home network from anywhere</li></ul><p>I took a look at apps like <a href="https://blokada.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blokada</a> and <a href="https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNS66</a> which grant you device wide ad blocking on mobile devices. On Android <a href="https://block.blokada.org/post/2018/06/17/how-does-blokada-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way this works is</a>, by creating an internal VPN on the phone, so that all traffic from the device can be routed via it, and it has a file with all the blacklisted domains, to filter out traffic.</p><p>But there's a caveat with this approach. I cannot use another VPN to route my traffic, due to an Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limitation</a>.</p><blockquote><p>There can be only one VPN connection running at the same time. The existing interface is deactivated when a new one is created.</p></blockquote><p>This means my browsing patterns are still accessible to my ISP. So, I started looking for ad blocking DNS servers, so that I could point Android's global DNS to it. I found <a href="https://adguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdGuard</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a> to be the top projects. Hosting these at home, on Raspberry Pi seemed like a plausible solution, but then again one can't use it while traveling. The solution is to obviously host it on a publicly accessible server. Amongst the two I found AdGuard more appealing due to the following reasons</p><ul><li>It has out of the box support for DNS-over-TLS</li><li>It maintains a single file for its entire configuration</li><li>It's written in Golang, and is much lighter on resources compared to PiHole</li></ul><p>You can find more about their differences <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#how-does-adguard-home-compare-to-pi-hole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Both are great projects, but AdGuard met my requirements perfectly.</p><p>When it comes to VPN, I did not even consider using OpenVPN, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WireGuard</a> was the obvious choice, because of it's speed, smaller, easily auditable codebase (not that I was going to audit it, but still), cross platform compatibility and integration into the Linux Kernel.</p><p>Being a big fan of Kubernetes and maintaining infrastructure as code, I wanted a way to be able to easily deploy and version control my deployment. After much searching I stumbled upon, <a href="https://github.com/squat/kilo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kilo</a>, a network overlay built on WireGuard for Kubernetes. It could do exactly what I wanted, while also enhancing the security of my cluster, by encrypting the inter pod communication, and allowing me to build secure clusters, over nodes spanning multiple cloud providers. Also it would give me the added benefit of easily debugging applications deployed on my Kubernetes Cluster, since when connected I would be a peer on the network, thereby getting access to the all the private IPs of the deployments, services etc. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPz_DAOOCKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this talk by Lucas Servén Marín</a> to know more.</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump right into the setup. I'll be explaining the steps for setting it up on a <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">k3s</a> cluster. You may need to modify them as per your cluster. After deploying k3s, the 1st thing which needs to be done is to setup kilo. First download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/kilo/master/manifests/kilo-k3s.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manifest</a> for kilo on k3s.</p><pre><code>curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/kilo/master/manifests/kilo-k3s.yaml
</code></pre><p>Now you need to modify and add <code>- --mesh-granularity=full</code> to the <code>DaemonSet</code> section under the <code>args</code> for the <code>kilo</code> container.</p><pre><code>...
containers:
- name: kilo
  image: squat/kilo
  args:
  - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig
  - --hostname=$(NODE_NAME)
  - --mesh-granularity=full
  env:
  - name: NODE_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: spec.nodeName
...
</code></pre><p>This is done to ensure all our nodes are meshed together regardless of the datacenter. Then simply apply the manifest.</p><pre><code>kubectl apply -f kilo-k3s.yaml
</code></pre><p>This will later be useful for setting up WireGuard VPN. More on this later. Now we can proceed to setup AdGuard. Here is the spec for AdGuard.</p><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1

</code></pre><p>The <code>RollingUpdate</code> is intentionally configured to not wait till a new pod is up, and directly terminate the existing pod during deploys. On the surface it seems like an anti-pattern, but since I'm using the <code>hostPort</code> directive, a new Pod wouldn't get scheduled unless port <code>53</code> was available on the host for it to bind to, so the existing Pod has to terminate before a new Pod can be deployed.</p><p>Also I initially intended to use a <code>ConfigMap</code> for holding the <code>AdGuardHome.yml</code>, but there was some issue with AdGuard trying to write to it while initally comming up, but since <code>ConfigMap</code>'s are moundted as <code>ReadOnly</code>, Pod creation used to fail, so I decided to go with a Volume instead, until I could figure out the issue.</p><p>For the initial setup, the AdGuard admin UI will be accessible on port 3000, so you'll have to switch the <code>targetPort</code> to <code>3000</code> in the <code>adguardhome</code> service initially, access the admin UI, setup the password, and then revert the <code>targetPort</code> to <code>80</code>.</p><p>You may also enable <code>DNSSEC</code> under <code>DNS Settings</code> for guaranteeing authenticity of DNS responses by signing them, and making tampering detectable.</p><p>The volume mounts for <code>tls-cert-secret</code> are only necessary if you want to enable DNS-over-TLS. And you need to configure your ingress resource before mounting it here.</p><p>For enabling DNS-over-TLS, on the AdGuard admin UI you can goto <code>Encryption Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Enable Encryption</code>, and put in the Certificate path as <code>/certs/tls.crt</code> and the Key path as <code>/certs/tls.key</code>. Again let me re-iterate that your Ingress resource needs to be configured properly and you need to have a valid TLS certificate for the domain you're hosting AdGuard on.</p><p>On Android phones for Android Pie and later, you may goto <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>WiFi and Internet</code> -&gt; <code>Private DNS</code>. Select <code>Private DNS Hostname Provider</code> and set it to the domain name to the once you've configured on. You may also configure it on your home router to ensure all the devices get DNS level Ad Blocking.</p><p>This concludes the AdGuard part of the setup.</p><hr><p>Now coming to setting up WireGuard.</p><p>I'll be referring to the k3s cluster as the server and the local laptop as the client from here on.</p><p>You'll need WireGaurd installed on both your server and client machine. Follow the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps as per your distribution</a> to install the same. If you're using a bleeding edge distro like Archlinux or Gentoo, you don't need to do anything on the server side, since WireGuard is already baked into the kernel at this point. On the client side however you'll need to install it for getting the command line client to enable / disable the interface.</p><p>Another useful tool to have on the client side is <code>kgctl</code>. You can install it using</p><pre><code>go get github.com/squat/kilo/cmd/kgctl
</code></pre><p>Now we need to create a private and a public key pair on the client.</p><pre><code>wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</code></pre><p>This'll create 2 files with the respective key contents. This key pair needs to be authorized on the server. You can do this simply by creating a peer resource. Create a file named <code>archie.yaml</code></p><pre><code>apiVersion: kilo.squat.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Peer
metadata:
  name: archie
spec:
  allowedIPs:
  - 10.120.120.1/32 # This is just and example, you can use any valid available CIDR here
  publicKey: CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY # Enter the public key here, the one you just generated
  persistentKeepalive: 10
</code></pre><p>Finally apply the manifest</p><pre><code>kubectl apply -f archie.yaml
</code></pre><p>Remember, the <code>allowedIPs</code> should be a valid CIDR, which is available on both the server and the client. Now we can use the <code>kgctl</code> tool to generate the <code>peer</code> section of the client WireGuard config.</p><pre><code>kgctl showconf peer archie
</code></pre><p>This will return something like</p><pre><code>[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 10.42.0.0/24, 10.42.0.0/32, 10.4.0.1/32
Endpoint = YOUR_SERVER_IP:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 10
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
</code></pre><p>Create a file on the client named <code>adgaurd.yaml</code> at the location <code>/etc/wireguard</code> and add the following contents to it</p><pre><code>[Interface]
Address = 10.120.120.1/32 # Use the same CIDR whitelisted in the Peer manifest
PrivateKey = CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY # The one you generated above on your client
DNS = YOUR_SERVER_IP # Enter the IP of the server to block ads, FQDN don't work on Android for some reason

[Peer]</code></pre></div></div></div>

<h2>Introducing crsh: a Javascript based command line shell</h2>
<p>12 July 2020</p>
<p>TL;DR: <a href="https://github.com/curlywurlycraig/crsh">GitHub link -&gt; Install instructions</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Existing shells generally operate with their own somewhat archaic syntax,
continuous with the underlying operating system and set of historical design choices.</p>

<p>This puts the majority of shell syntax just out of reach for a very large subset of command line users who use the command line for little more than launching one or two command line tools, navigating directories, and maybe ocassionally piping commands or outputting them to files. These users will usually write scripts in a language more familiar to them as soon as things get a little trickier (because the value of learning the control flow syntax in <code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, or <code>fish</code> does not seem like time well spent).</p>

<p>This is not a criticism of those shells, exactly. But it does highlight a potential space for new shells that can better fulfill the needs of these users. Conversely, if you are an experienced bash shell scripter, and terms like “file descriptors” and <code>SIGCHLD</code> mean something to you, you will probably dislike my approach here. But please feel free to stick around and provide some advice.</p>

<h2 id="enter-crsh">Enter crsh</h2>

<p>I’ve started work on a shell that can seamlessly interoperate Javascript syntax (and in fact works by <code>eval</code>ing JS in the Deno runtime) and traditional shell execution.</p>

<p>Regular command execution will be familiar to those who have used the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls | grep .js
builtins.js
dsh.js
functions.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And inline anonymous functions will be familiar to those who have used Javascript:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span>
<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Returning a list from an inline function will be outputted as separate lines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>fill</span><span>().</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`Line </span><span>${</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>0</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>1</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>2</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>3</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Combining these concepts can yield a very expressive shell:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>ls</span> <span>|</span> <span>({</span> <span>lines</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>lines</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`line </span><span>${</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>${</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> <span>line</span> <span>3</span>
<span>line</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>js</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note in the above that <code>lines</code> is made available to piped inline functions.
JSON output piped into an inline function is automatically parsed and made available as a <code>json</code> parameter:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/58611129-2dbc-4a81-a72f-77ddfc1b1b49 | ({ json }) =&gt; json.title
My Neighbor Totoro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As can be seen, such a shell lends itself very well to parsing JSON (it is <em>Javascript</em> Object Notation after all).</p>

<p>To go one step further in this example, we can navigate multi-request JSON API calls in a human-readable way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>curl</span> <span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/ | ({ json }) =&gt; json[0].people | xargs curl | ({ json }) =&gt; json[0].name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the above may look less readable than something like <code>jq</code>, those with a Javascript background will appreciate the transferability of knowledge. Even without such a background, the advantage of executing arbitrary logic inline with other shell calls in a modern language should be apparent.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Currently, the easy parts to configure are the prompt and auto-completion rules. This is done by way of editing the JS source directly. The prompt is specified as a function which returns a string, and exported from a <code>prompt.js</code> file like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>magenta</span><span>,</span> <span>stripColor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/std/fmt/colors.ts"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>prompt</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>currentDir</span> <span>=</span> <span>magenta</span><span>(</span><span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>());</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>currentDir</span><span>}</span><span> › `</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>promptLength</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>stripColor</span><span>(</span><span>prompt</span><span>()).</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the auto-completion rules are specified as a list of objects representing the regex to match the input on, and the logic to return the list of completion to cycle through:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>gitRules</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git add /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeFile</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git checkout /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeBranches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git branch -D /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeBranches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeCommands</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Community-made auto-completion rules and prompts could be hosted in the usual <a href="https://deno.land/x">Deno way</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>There is still a lot to do to make this better. Bug fixes, features like multiline support, persisting history, etc. Any feedback is welcome in the form of issues in the GitHub repo.</p>

<![CDATA[The Future of Online Identity Is Decentralized]]>

July 12, 2020 | https://yarmo.eu/post/future-online-identity-decentralized | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yarmo.eu/post/future-online-identity-decentralized">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Online identity</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity">Online&nbsp;identity</a> refers to the concept of "being" in the digital world. As an internet user, you exist. You create accounts on websites. You write on social media and blogs. You post photos. All this online activity has in common that one and the same person performed these actions; it defines your "online&nbsp;identity".</p>
<p>However, your "online&nbsp;identity" is not <em>per se</em> representative of your "social&nbsp;identity" in the physical world.</p>
<p>You may choose to use your own name or a pseudonym. You may choose to publish personally identifiable information or not. You may choose to remain truthful to your social identity or deceive. In short, you may choose for authenticity or for anonymity.</p>
<h2>Authenticity versus anonymity</h2>
<p>Authenticity and anonymity aren't mutually exclusive and that is the beauty of the internet. In the physical realm, you are (mostly) limited to a single social identity. In the digital space, there are no such restrictions. While you can't embody multiple persons in the offline world, you can have several identities online. In fact, you can even have multiple accounts on the same platform, opting for a different balance between authenticity and anonymity for each one of them.</p>
<p>The anonymity has its downsides, creating psychological artifacts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect">online&nbsp;disinhibition</a> and facilitating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying">cyberharassment</a>. However, even though we are far from completely overcoming these challenges, the internet that allows us to remain anonymous is still the one we should want and fight for.</p>
<h2>Consolidation of identity and internet corporations</h2>
<p>Removing the possibility for anonymity could solve the problem of online toxicity. Large internet corporations like Google and Facebook allow all to create an account on condition that some personally identifiable information is revealed, usually a phone number.</p>
<p>The benefit is that it deters most from repeatably creating new accounts when older accounts have been flagged or banned due to improper behavior. These companies gain the function of "identity provider": they manage your online identity that can be used to login in different locations of the internet. We all know many websites that offer a "Google login" or "Facebook login".</p>
<p>But there is a problem: handling the entire online identity of a single person is too much responsibility for any corporation or organization, especially if it is in their interest to gain intimate individual knowledge and sell it (Google) or use it to manipulate moods and influence decision making (Facebook).</p>
<p>That phone number that was once used to prevent online toxicity is now the first of many pieces of personally identifiable information that these corporations will seek and use to figure out who you are.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to hide"? Great. The internet corporations will still make money hand over fist by selling your personality, your preferences, your buying patterns and your vote. And not just yours. That of entire populations.</p>
<p>Know that profits are just the tip of the iceberg. Governments all around the world are also interested in knowing what their citizens think, say and do for very different motives.</p>
<h2>Going decentralized</h2>
<p>The solution is relatively simple. When you create a new account and get to choose between "Google&nbsp;login", "Facebook&nbsp;login" and "Email&nbsp;login", pick "Email&nbsp;login".</p>
<p>The benefit of not giving away any more personal data and tracking possibilities outweigh the inconvenience of having to fill in your email address and a password, especially when using a password manager. As tempting as the alternative is, making these changes will improve your life and ultimately, when enough people join these efforts, that of the world population.</p>
<p>A different problem arises: how to prove online identity when decentralized?</p>
<h2>Decentralized online identity</h2>
<p>When you are no longer relying on an identity provider to manage your entire online identity, you lose the one common thing all your accounts on different platforms had: if two accounts on different online platforms are created by the same Google or Facebook account, we can safely assume they belong to the same person.</p>
<p>But this "trust by proxy" is lost when the accounts on those platforms were created without identity provider. And whether authentic or anonymous, it can sometimes be extremely useful to know and trust that separate accounts on the internet belong to the same person, even when not knowing who this person is.</p>
<p>The username is not sufficient to identify accounts across platforms. If you are "Alice" on one website, chances are you might need to be "Alice123" on the next one. And what if someone close to you is contacted by an "Aliss" requesting an amount of money to be transferred because they believe you to be in some sort of trouble? A poor attempt at impersonation, I know… Don't worry, a real bad actor will put in more effort and make a much more convincing act.</p>
<h2>Proving decentralized online identity</h2>
<p>What if not only your online identity is decentralized, but also the tool to prove said online identity? This would mean that you wouldn't need to depend on a single company or entity to prove your identity across platforms. Decentralized identity, decentralized proofs!</p>
<p>Such solutions are already being deployed in industry, for example by firms like <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech</a> which focus on blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Built for individuals, I recently launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide</a> which uses cryptographic keypairs to accomplish decentralized identity verification. While it doesn't (and shouldn't!) link an account to a person in the physical realm, it links accounts across platforms.</p>
<p>If you trust an account on one platform, you can trust any other account on any other platform as long as they are both verified by "identity proofs" stored in the same keypair. Whether you choose authenticity or anonymity, decentralized identity proofs allow you to build a cross-platform online identity.</p>
<p>Here's my <a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">Keyoxide profile</a>. In this case, I link to several "authentic" accounts but I could easily generate a new keypair void of personal data that links to several anonymous accounts. The accounts don't need to be authentic to create an online persona.</p>
<p>All the accounts listed in the link above belong to me. No one else could claim these accounts. Here's how.</p>
<h2>Identity proofs</h2>
<p>An "identity proof" is nothing more than a link to an account A on some platform P stored inside your keypair K. If a "proof verification tool" such as Keyoxide follows this link and discovers some piece of data linking back to keypair K (which is only possible if keypair K and account A on platform P belong to the same person), the account is verified. If this proof verification is done for several accounts on different platforms, it is beyond reasonable doubt that the same person owns said accounts.</p>
<p>No bad actor could claim one of your accounts: the piece of data that links back is specific to your keypair, not the bad actor's keypair. And the bad actor also couldn't insert a proof inside your keypair as long as your keypair isn't compromised. Only you, the owner of the keypair, can add new proofs. But the entire world can read and verify them.</p>
<p>These identity proofs are decentralized because Keyoxide doesn't store them, your cryptographic keypair does. Keyoxide simply reads the keys and verifies the proofs. When you remove a proof from your keypair, Keyoxide will no longer have access to it. You own your proofs and your online identity.</p>
<p>In fact, the proofs are readable by everyone and are not specifically designed for Keyoxide. Anyone can use any tool or create new ones to verify these proofs and developers are encouraged to enrich this field with additional tools and services. Let's build a decentralized identity ecosystem we can all trust.</p>
<h2>Online identity beyond today's internet</h2>
<p>Initiatives like <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid">Solid</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> are paving the way for a new internet where all data is owned by the user and shared with platforms with consent and restrictions. This would solve the online identity problem: you get the benefits of a "pseudo centralized" account while maintaining full ownership over all account-related data stored on a decentralized platform. Social media would be allowed to see some data, messaging platforms some other data. But there would still be one single account to rule all the platforms.</p>
<p>On today's internet, the best we can do is make fully separated accounts, link them using technologies like decentralized online identity proofs and create our own online personas, with our own open tools that ensure we maintain ownership over them.</p></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="Pattern-Matching"><a href="#Pattern-Matching" title="Pattern Matching"></a>Pattern Matching</h2><p>To understand Pattern Matching, let’s start with something familiar in JavaScript - Switch Case.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example that uses <code>switch case</code> in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>print_color</span><span>(</span>color<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>color<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"rose"</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"roses are red,"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"violet"</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"violets are blue,"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"sugar is sweet, and so are you."</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"rose"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"violet"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"you"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust code:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>print_color</span><span>(</span>color<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span>str<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> color <span>{</span>
    <span>"rose"</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"roses are red,"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"violet"</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"violets are blue,"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    _ <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"sugar is sweet, and so are you."</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"rose"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"violet"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"you"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Most of the code should be immediately understandable. The <code>match</code> expression has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code><span>match</span> VALUE <span>{</span>
  PATTERN1 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION1<span>,</span>
  PATTERN2 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION2<span>,</span>
  PATTERN3 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION3<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The fat arrow <code>=&gt;</code> syntax might trip us up because of the similarities with JavaScript arrow functions but they’re unrelated. The last pattern that uses underscore <code>_</code> is called the catchall pattern and is similar to the default case in switch case. Each <code>PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION</code> combination is called a <code>match arm</code>.</p>
<p>The above example doesn’t really convey how useful pattern matching is - it just looks like switch case with a different syntax and a fancy name. Let’s talk about destructuring and enums to understand why pattern matching is useful.</p>
<h2 id="Destructuring"><a href="#Destructuring" title="Destructuring"></a>Destructuring</h2><p>Destructuring is the process of extracting the inner fields of an array or struct into separate variables. If you have used destructuring in JavaScript, it is very similar in Rust.</p>
<p>Here’s an example in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> rgb <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>96</span><span>,</span> <span>172</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>[</span>red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>]</span> <span>=</span> rgb<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>red<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>green<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>blue<span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"shesh"</span><span>,</span> city<span>:</span> <span>"singapore"</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>{</span> name<span>,</span> city <span>}</span> <span>=</span> person<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>city<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same example in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Person <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
  city<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> rgb <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>96</span><span>,</span> <span>172</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>[</span>red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>]</span> <span>=</span> rgb<span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> red<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> green<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> blue<span>)</span><span>;</span> 

  <span>let</span> person <span>=</span> Person <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>"shesh"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    city<span>:</span> <span>"singapore"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> Person <span>{</span> name<span>,</span> city <span>}</span> <span>=</span> person<span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> city<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Comparing-Structs"><a href="#Comparing-Structs" title="Comparing Structs"></a>Comparing Structs</h2><p>It’s very common to write “if this then that” type of code. Combining destructuring and pattern matching allows us to write these type of logic in a very concise way.</p>
<p>Let’s take this following example in JavaScript. It’s contrived but you have probably written something like this sometime in your career:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> point <span>=</span> <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> x<span>,</span> y <span>}</span> <span>=</span> point<span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>x <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> y <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"both are zero"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>x <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is zero and y is </span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>y <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is </span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span> and y is zero`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is </span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span> and y is </span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s write the same code in Rust using pattern matching:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Point <span>{</span>
  x<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span>
  y<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> point <span>=</span> Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>match</span> point <span>{</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"both are zero"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x is zero and y is {}"</span><span>,</span> y<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x is {} and y is zero"</span><span>,</span> x<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>,</span> y <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x is {} and y is {}"</span><span>,</span> x<span>,</span> y<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a bit concise compared to the <code>if else</code> logic but also might be confusing as we’re performing comparison, destructuring and variable binding at the same time.</p>
<p>This is how it looks like visually:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-4/pattern-matching-rust-1.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-4/pattern-matching-rust-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We begin to see why it’s named as “pattern matching” - we take an input and see which pattern in the match arms “fits” better - It’s like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shape+sorter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape sorter</a> toys that kids play with. Apart from comparison, we also do variable binding in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th match arms. We pass variables x or y or both to their respective expressions.</p>
<p>Pattern matching is also <code>exhaustive</code> - that is, it forces you to handle all the possible cases. Try removing the last match arm and Rust won’t let you compile the code.</p>
<h2 id="Enum"><a href="#Enum" title="Enum"></a>Enum</h2><p>JavaScript doesn’t have Enums but if you’ve used TypeScript, you can think of Rust’s Enums as a combination of TypeScript’s <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enums</a> and TypeScript’s <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#discriminated-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discriminated Unions</a></p>
<p>In the simplest case, Enums can be used as a group of constants.</p>
<p>For example, even though JavaScript doesn’t have Enums, you might have used this pattern:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> DIRECTION <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  FORWARD<span>:</span> <span>"FORWARD"</span><span>,</span>
  BACKWARD<span>:</span> <span>"BACKWARD"</span><span>,</span>
  LEFT<span>:</span> <span>"LEFT"</span><span>,</span>
  RIGHT<span>:</span> <span>"RIGHT"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>FORWARD<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Forward"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>BACKWARD<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Backward"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>LEFT<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Left"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>RIGHT<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Right"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>DIRECTION<span>.</span>FORWARD<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here, we could’ve defined the FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT and RIGHT as separate constants, yet grouping it inside the DIRECTION object has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The names FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT and RIGHT are namespaced under DIRECTION so naming conflicts can be avoided</li>
<li>It is self-documenting as we can quickly see all the valid directions available in the codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some problems with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if someone passes NORTH or UP as an argument to move_drone? To fix this, we can add a validation to make sure that only values present in the DIRECTION object is allowed in the move function.</li>
<li>What if we decide to support UP and DOWN in future or rename LEFT/RIGHT to PORT/STARBOARD? We need to find all the places where similar switch-case or if-else is used. There’s a chance that we might miss out a few places which would cause issues in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enums in strongly typed languages like Rust are more powerful as they solve these problems without us writing extra code.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a function can take in only a small set of valid inputs, Enums can be used to enforce this constraint</li>
<li>Enums with pattern matching force you to cover all cases. Useful when you’re updating Enums in future</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust example:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Direction <span>{</span>
  Forward<span>,</span>
  Backward<span>,</span>
  Left<span>,</span>
  Right<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>direction<span>:</span> Direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> direction <span>{</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Forward <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Forward"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Backward <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Backward"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Left <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Left"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Right <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Right"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Forward<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We access the <code>variants</code> inside Enum using the <code>::</code> notation. Try editing this code by calling “move_drone(Direction::Up)” or adding “Down” as a new item in the Direction enum. In the first case, the compiler will throw an error saying that “Up” is not found in “Direction” and in the second case, the compiler will complain that we haven’t covered “Down” in the match block.</p>
<p>Rust Enums can do much more than act as a group of constants - we can also associate data with an Enum variant.</p>

<p>Here, we’ve added one more Enum called Operation that contains “unit like” variants (PowerOn, PowerOff, Rotate) and “struct like” variants (Move, TakePhoto). Notice how we’ve used pattern matching with destructuring and variable binding.</p>

We have put together a list of popular books that can help you get started.&nbsp;</p><h2>1) <strong>Fastlane Millionaire by MJ DeMarco</strong></h2><div><figure><img src="https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fastlane-Millionaire-by-MJ-DeMarco-1024x576.jpg" alt="The Millionaire Fastlane by M.J.

They believe that various unseen forces suppress or even quench this innate creativity. They emphasize the fact that creative inspiration is not associated with job titles or organizational hierarchy. This is a great book for managers as it helps them understand the importance of a good team and educates them about acceptable team dynamics.&nbsp;</p><h2>3) <strong>Range by David Epstein</strong></h2><div><figure><img src="https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein.jpg" alt="Range by David Epstein" srcset="https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein.jpg 837w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-300x182.jpg 300w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-768x465.jpg 768w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-561x340.jpg 561w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-364x220.jpg 364w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-728x441.jpg 728w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-608x368.jpg 608w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-758x459.jpg 758w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-79x48.jpg 79w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-158x96.jpg 158w, https://256057-1374499-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Range-by-David-Epstein-313x190.jpg 313w" sizes="100vw"></figure></div><p>We have all heard time and again about the importance of starting early, honing skills, and striving to succeed. The book will help you understand the reason behind generalists’ success during times of increasing specialization. In his book, Range, David Epstein draws a vivid comparison between those who start young and those who take time to find their interest. He uses real-life celebrities as examples to draw takeaways about specializing, experimenting, and abstract thinking.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><span>This is a story of how the SAS rescued myself and two colleagues who were trapped in the British embassy in Tirana having been evacuated into the embassy on 12th September 12th 1998 as the country erupted into civil unrest and lawlessness. The boys from Hereford did good!</span></p>
<p>This was my first diplomatic posting and during the course of my career I took part in the <span>evacuation of British nationals&nbsp;(and others)</span><span>&nbsp;in a number of locations but on this occasion, I was the one being evacuated albeit from my residence to the embassy as a place of safety.<a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/libya-timely-evacuation-of-oil-workers/">Libya – Timely Evacuation Of Oil Workers During Arab Spring 2011</a></span></p>
<p>This was a day I was not going to forget in a hurry. I had just under four months left before my tour ended and I had spent the previous day at work trawling through future job opportunities. The Ambassador was again out of the country and the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM) was once more in charge. I should have known from previous experience and recent incidents that trouble always seemed to flare up when Ambassadors are away from post.</p>
<p>On this day, I awoke very early to the sounds of large explosions and the rattle of gunfire that seemed to be going off in all directions. What was going on? There had been no forewarning of trouble and things had been relatively quiet and stable in the city over the preceding weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to get hold of the DHM on my mobile phone but the network was down, always a bad sign. I immediately got on the embassy radio net and contacted her. She said that she had just heard from the German Embassy that a local high profile opposition politician, Azem Hajdari, had been assassinated outside the Parliament building and his Democratic Party (DP) supporters were on the warpath blaming the Socialist government party for the murder.</p>
<p>Tanks, automatic weapons and armoured personnel carriers had been seized by DP members and the government were now calling this an attempted coup d’etat and responding with armed force of its own.</p>
<p>She advised me to keep my head down, keep the radio close to hand and they would try and get an Embassy armoured vehicle to me as soon as possible and we would all rendezvous at the embassy. By this time, the noise of fighting outside seemed to be getting louder and getting nearer. The main government quarter was only just two blocks away from my apartment and it sounded like the main fighting was in this area. I cautiously pulled back a shutter and looked outside and saw there was a lot of smoke billowing forth from that quarter.</p>
<p>After about an hour, I heard a familiar voice on the radio, it was Benny our Embassy driver calling from the armoured car radio just outside my front gate. Not for the first time had he come to get me out of another messy situation. He advised me to be careful coming out as there was a body in front of my gate.</p>
<p>As I came out, the noise was deafening, there was small arms firing which appeared to be coming from the next street and there was indeed a man in what looked like a policeman’s uniform lying just to the side of my gate.</p>
<p>I didn’t hang around to assess his condition as just at that moment, a large group of armed men turned the corner on to my street firing in our direction as they advanced. Why they were shooting at a vehicle that was clearly marked as a diplomatic car, I had no idea. I jumped into the car and Benny quickly reversed the vehicle away from the onrushing crowd, turned it around at the intersection and off we sped to the embassy taking as many back roads as possible.</p>
<p>We reached the embassy safely but it was disturbing to see that the usual government provided armed security guarding the Embassy and the surrounds was nowhere to be seen. We drew up to the embassy and I ran into the building. Both the DHM and Management Officer (MO) were already there. The DHM had already contacted London and appraised them of the situation. It appeared that the violence was escalating and that it could very well be a coup d’etat. London advised us to remain in lockdown in the embassy and to stay there until further notice. Not very reassuring.</p>
<p>The hours went by, nighttime came and the sky was lit up with explosions and the gunfire seemed to be getting closer to the embassy. Throughout all of this, the DHM was updating London via our secure communication channels of our ever-growing precarious situation. They continued to advise us to stay in the embassy as help was on the way. What did that mean? How on earth were they going to help us? They were in London and we were trapped and bottled up at the sharp end.</p>
<p>Well, indeed help was on the way in the most unexpected form. After a long, restless and uncomfortable night trying to sleep on the floor of my office under my desk, as dawn was breaking, there was the sound of screeching tyres outside the embassy.</p>
<p>At first we thought this was it, the bad guys had arrived and we were destined for some form of uncertain captivity or worse, but no, out of two strange looking 4x4s, poured a section of heavily armed and equipped Special Air Service (SAS) troopers who had flown into Tirana airport from the UK in an RAF transport aircraft (without any flight clearance), offloaded themselves and sped the 17 Kms to the embassy.</p>
<p>There were no formalities, the SAS section commander immediately told the DHM that he was in charge and that we were to follow his instructions until further notice. For the time being, he said, there were no orders for evacuating us, his men would go out and evaluate the situation on the ground and then make a recommendation back to London.</p>
<p>They then set up their own communications suite in the Ambassador’s office (their communication specialist felt very much at home behind the large Ambassadorial desk), brought in their weapons and stores and after a short briefing, their patrol set off. Benny our driver volunteered to go with them and act as guide and interpreter if needed.</p>
<p>While one party was employed on this task another group made a start of setting up defensive positions within the embassy and thoroughly briefing us on what to do if we were subjected to an attack. It really was a boost to our morale that we had these guys now with us, more than able to physically protect us and if needed get us out of there to a place of safety if things deteriorated.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon the first patrol returned to the embassy. The good news was that they reported our homes had appeared from the outside not to have been looted. They said there was still heavy fighting going on in various parts of the city, but it seemed to be centred mainly around the government quarter. Benny told us later that the patrol had been menaced on several occasions by armed men, but a few well aimed shots above the heads of the mob had convinced them to melt away and not to mess with the patrol.</p>
<p>The fighting went on for about three days. Each day the sound of gunfire and explosions seemed to decrease. The SAS continued to send out rotating patrols to monitor the situation in and around the city, deciding after the third day that there was no need to evacuate us out of the country as their assessment was the fighting had run its course. Indeed thankfully, on the fourth day there was silence, no gunfire and no explosions.</p>
<p>The SAS kept us in the embassy for just over a week before they deemed it fully safe for us to return to our homes and resume normal work. We also received reassurances from the Albanian government that the fighting had now ceased, order had been restored and our local security would be reinstated. All of this was good news indeed.</p>
<p>However, it was a sad day when we came to bid farewell to our SAS rescuers as they packed up to leave. We had got to know them pretty well over the course of a long week. They were a thoroughly professional, no nonsense group of guys who were extremely sociable in the rare moments they took time out to relax in between patrols with a wealth of stories that kept us entertained during the long days and nights we were cooped up in the embassy.</p>
<p>I personally would miss their army ration packs on which we all lived, apart from rare welcome pizzas they brought back occasionally from goodness knows where by some of the patrols.</p>
<p>With impeccable timing, the day after they left, the Ambassador returned to post. Even he, not usually one to crack a joke at the best of times remarked tongue in cheek that in future he would give us ample warning of his next trip out of country so that we could be prepared for the next crisis. Not funny. Yes, by all means forewarn us of your next absence but make it far enough in advance so that I for one could also ensure I was not around as well!</p>

    <time datetime="2017-05-08T00:00:00+00:00">May 08, 2017</time>
  </header>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903">recent paper</a> suggested a new mathematical
point of view on version control. I first found out about it from <code>pijul</code>,
a new version control system (VCS) that is loosely inspired by that paper. But
if you poke around the <code>pijul</code> <a href="https://pijul.com/">home page</a>, you won’t find
many details about what makes it different from existing VCSes. So I did a bit
of digging, and this series of blog posts is the result.</p>

<p>In the first part (i.e. this one), I’ll go over some of the theory developed in
the paper. In particular, I’ll describe a way to think about patches and
merging that is guaranteed to never, ever have a merge conflict. In the second
part, I’ll show how <code>pijul</code> puts that theory into action, and in the third part
I’ll dig into <code>pijul</code>’s implementation.</p>

<p>Before getting into some patch theory, a quick caveat: any real VCS needs to
deal with a lot of tedious details (directories, binary files, file renaming,
etc.). In order to get straight to the interesting new ideas, I’ll be skipping
all that. For the purposes of these posts, a VCS only needs to keep track of
a single file, which you should think of as a list of lines.</p>



<p>A patch is the difference between two files. Later in this series we’ll be
looking at some wild new ideas, so let’s start with something familiar and
comforting. The kind of patches we’ll discuss here go back to the early days of
Unix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a patch works line-by-line (as opposed to, for example, word-by-word); and</li>
  <li>a patch can add new lines, but not modify existing lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to actually have a useful VCS, you need to be able to delete lines
also. But deleting lines turns out to add some complications, so we’ll deal
with them later.</p>

<p>For an example, let’s start with a simple file: my to-do list for this morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_1.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking back at the list, I realize that I forgot something important. Here’s the new one:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_2.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>To go from the original to-do list to the new one, I added the line with the
socks. In the format of the original Unix “diff” utility, the patch would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_3.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>The “1a2” line is a code saying that we’re going to add something after line 1 of the
input file, and the next bit is obviously telling us what to insert.</p>

<p>Since this blog isn’t a command line tool, we’ll represent patches with pretty diagrams
instead of flat files. Here’s how we’ll draw the patch above:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_4.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Hopefully it’s self-explanatory, but just in case: an arrow goes from left to
right to indicate that the line on the right is the same as the one on the
left. Lines on the right with no arrow coming in are the ones that got added.
Since patches aren’t allowed to re-order the lines, the lines are guaranteed
not to cross.</p>

<p>There’s something implicit in our notation that really needs to be said out
loud: for us, <b>a patch is tied to a specific input file</b>. This is the first point
where we diverge from the classic Unix ways: the classic Unix patch that we
produced using “diff” could in principle be applied to <em>any</em> input file, and it
would still insert “* put on socks” after the first line. In many cases that
wouldn’t be what you want, but sometimes it is.</p>



<p>The best thing about patches is that they can enable multiple people to edit
the same file and then merge their changes afterwards. Let’s suppose that my
wife also decides to put things on my to-do list: she
takes the original file and adds a line:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_5.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now there are two new versions of my to-do list: mine with the socks, and my
wife’s with the garbage. Let’s draw them all together:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_6.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This brings us to merging: since I’d prefer to have my to-do list as a single
file, I want to merge my wife’s changes and my own. In this example, it’s
pretty obvious what the result should be, but let’s look at the general problem
of merging. We’ll do this slowly and carefully, and our endpoint might be
different from what you’re used to.</p>

<h2 id="patch-composition">Patch composition</h2>

<p>First, I need to introduce some notation for an obvious concept: the
<em>composition</em> of two patches is the patch that you would get by applying one
patch and then applying the other. Since a “patch” for us also includes the
original file, you can’t just compose any two old patches. If <code>p</code> is a patch
taking the file <code>O</code> to the file <code>A</code> and <code>r</code> is a patch taking <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>, then
you can compose the two (but only in one order!) to obtain a patch from <code>O</code> to
<code>B</code>. I’ll write this composition as <code>pr</code>: first apply <code>p</code>, then <code>r</code>.</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to visualize patch composition using our diagrams: to compute
the composition of two paths, just “follow the arrows”</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_7.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>to get the (dotted red) patch going from <code>O</code> to <code>B</code>.</p>

<h2 id="merging-as-composition">Merging as composition</h2>

<p>I’m going to define carefully what a merge is in terms of patch composition.
I’ll do this in a very math-professor kind of way: I’ll give a precise
definition, followed by some examples, and only afterwards will I explain
why the definition makes sense.
So here’s the definition: if <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are two different patches
taking the file <code>O</code> to the files <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively, a <em>merge</em> of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>
is a pair of patches <code>r</code> and <code>s</code> such that</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>r</code> and <code>s</code> take <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively to a common output file <code>M</code>, and</li>
  <li><code>pr = qs</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can illustrate this definition with a simple diagram, where the capital
letters denote files, and the lower-case letters are patches going between
them:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_8.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Instead of saying that <code>pr = qs</code>, a mathematician (or anyone who wants
to sound fancy) would say that the diagram above <em>commutes</em>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_9.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>And here is an example of something that is not a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_10.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is not a merge because it fails the condition <code>pr = qs</code>: composing the
patches along the top path gives</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_11.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>but composing them along the bottom path gives</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_12.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Specifically, the two patches disagree on which of the shoes in the final list
came from the original file. This is the real meaning underlying the condition
<code>pr = qs</code>: it means that there will never be any ambiguity about which lines
came from where. If you’re used to using <code>blame</code> or <code>annotate</code> commands with
your favorite VCS, you can probably imagine why this sort of ambiguity would be
bad.</p>

<h2 id="a-historical-note">A historical note</h2>

<p>Merging patches is an old idea, of course, and so I just want to briefly
explain how the presentation above differs from “traditional” merging:
traditionally, merging was defined by algorithms (of which there are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Merge_algorithms">many</a>). These algorithms would try to automatically find a good merge; if
they couldn’t, you would be asked to supply one instead.</p>

<p>We’ll take a different approach: instead of starting with an algorithm, we’ll
start with a list of properties that we want a good merge to satisfy. At the end,
we’ll find that there’s a unique merge that satisfies all these properties
(and fortunately for us, there will also be an efficient algorithm to find it).</p>



<p>The main problem with merges is that they aren’t unique. This isn’t a huge
problem by itself: lots of great things aren’t unique. The problem is that we
usually want to merge automatically, and an automatic system needs an
unambiguous answer. Eventually, we’ll deal with this by defining a special
class of merges (called perfect merges) which will be unique. Before that,
we’ll explore the problem with some examples.</p>

<h2 id="a-silly-example">A silly example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with a silly example, in which our merge tool decides to
add some extra nonsense:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_13.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>No sane merge tool would ever do that, of course, but it’s still a valid
merge according to our rule in the last section. Clearly, we’ll have
to tighten up the rules to exclude this case.</p>

<h2 id="a-serious-example">A serious example</h2>

<p>Here is a more difficult situation with two merges that are actually
reasonable:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_14.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Both of these merges are valid according to our rules above, but you need to
actually know what the lines <em>mean</em> in order to decide that the first merge is
better (especially if it’s raining outside). Any reasonable automatic merging
tool would refuse to choose, instead requiring its user to do the merge
manually.</p>

<p>The examples above are pretty simple, but how would you decide in general
whether a merge is unambiguous and can be performed automatically? In existing
tools, the details depend on the merging algorithm. Since we started off with
a non-algorithmic approach, let’s see where that leads: instead of specifying
explicitly which merges we can do, we’ll describe the properties that an ideal
merge should have.</p>



<p>The main idea behind the
definition I’m about to give is that it will never cause any regrets. That is,
no matter what happens in the future, we can always represent the history just
as well through the merge as we could using the original branches. Obviously,
that’s a nice property to have; personally, I think it’s non-obvious why it’s
a good choice as the <em>defining</em> property of the ideal merge, but we’ll get to
that later.</p>

<p>Ok, here it comes. Consider a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_15.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>And now suppose that the original creators of patches <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>
continued working on their own personal branches, which merged sometime in
the future at the file <code>F</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_16.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>We say that the merge <code>(r, s)</code> is a <em>perfect merge</em> if for <em>every</em> possible
choice of the merge <code>(u, v)</code>, there is a unique patch <code>w</code> so that <code>u = rw</code>
and <code>v = sw</code>. (In math terms, the diagram commutes.)
We’re going to call <code>w</code> a <em>continuation</em>, since it tells us how to continue
working from the merged file. To repeat, a merge is perfect if for every
possible future, there is a unique continuation.</p>

<h2 id="a-perfect-merge">A perfect merge</h2>

<p>Let’s do a few examples to explore the various corners of our definition.
First, an example of a perfect merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_17.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>It takes a bit of effort to actually <em>prove</em> that this is a perfect merge;
I’ll leave that as an exercise. It’s more interesting to see some examples
that fail to be perfect.</p>

<h2 id="a-silly-example-1">A silly example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the silly example of a merge that introduced an unnecessary
line:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_18.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This turns out (surprise, surprise) not to be a perfect merge.
To understand how our definition of merge perfection excludes merges like this,

<p>Today’s developers are expected to develop resilient and scalable 
distributed systems. Systems that are easy to patch in the face of 
security concerns and easy to do low-risk incremental upgrades. Systems 
that benefit from software reuse and innovation of the open source 
model. Achieving all of this for different languages, using a variety of
 application frameworks with embedded libraries is not possible.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/multi-runtime-microservice-architecture/" rel="external" target="_blank">blogged</a>
 about “Multi-Runtime Microservices Architecture” where I have explored 
the needs of distributed systems such as lifecycle management, advanced 
networking, resource binding, state abstraction and how these 
abstractions have been changing over the years. I also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPEIJFJV9k" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;“The
 Evolution of Distributed Systems on Kubernetes” covering how Kubernetes
 Operators and the sidecar model are acting as the primary innovation 
mechanisms for delivering the same distributed system primitives.</p>
<p>On both occasions, the main takeaway is the prediction that the 
progression of software application architectures on Kubernetes moves 
towards the sidecar model managed by operators. Sidecars and operators 
could become a mainstream software distribution and consumption model 
and in some cases even replace software libraries and frameworks as we 
are used to.</p>
<p>The sidecar model allows the composition of applications written in 
different languages to deliver joint value, faster and without the 
runtime coupling. Let’s see a few concrete examples of sidecars and 
operators, and then we will explore how this new software composition 
paradigm could impact us.</p>
<h2>Out-of-Process Smarts on the Rise</h2>
<p>In Kubernetes, a sidecar is one of the <a href="http://k8spatterns.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">core design patterns</a>
 achieved easily by organizing multiple containers in a single Pod. The 
Pod construct ensures that the containers are always placed on the same 
node and can cooperate by interacting over networking, file system or 
other IPC methods. And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/" rel="external" target="_blank">operators</a>
 allow the automation, management and integration of the sidecars with 
the rest of the platform. The sidecars represent a language-agnostic, 
scalable data plane offering distributed primitives to custom 
applications. And the operators represent their centralized management 
and control plane.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few popular manifestations of the sidecar model.</p>
<h3>Envoy</h3>
<p>Service Meshes such as Istio, Consul, and others are using transparent service proxies such as <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Envoy</a>
 for delivering enhanced networking capabilities for distributed 
systems. Envoy can improve security, it enables advanced traffic 
management, improves resilience, adds deep monitoring and tracing 
features. Not only that, it understands more and more Layer 7 protocols 
such as Redis, MongoDB, MySQL and most recently Kafka. It also added 
response caching capabilities and even WebAssembly support that will 
enable all kinds of custom plugins. Envoy is an example of how a 
transparent service proxy adds advanced networking capabilities to a 
distributed system without including them into the runtime of the 
distributed application components.</p>
<h3>Skupper</h3>
<p>In addition to the typical service mesh, there are also projects, such as<a href="https://skupper.io/" rel="external" target="_blank"> Skupper</a>,
 that ship application networking capabilities through an external 
agent. Skupper solves multicluster Kubernetes communication challenges 
through a Layer 7 virtual network and offers advanced routing and 
connectivity capabilities. But rather than embedding Skupper into the 
business service runtime, it runs an instance per Kubernetes namespace 
which acts as a shared sidecar.</p>
<h3>Cloudstate</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloudstate.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Cloudstate</a>
 is another example of the sidecar model, but this time for providing 
stateful abstractions for the serverless development model. It offers 
stateful primitives over GRPC for EventSourcing, CQRS, Pub/Sub, 
Key/Value stores and other use cases. Again, it an example of sidecars 
and operators in action but this time for the serverless programming 
model.</p>
<h3>Dapr</h3>
<p><a href="https://dapr.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Dapr</a>
 is a relatively young project started by Microsoft, and it is also 
using the sidecar model for providing developer-focused distributed 
system primitives. Dapr offers abstractions for state management, 
service invocation and fault handling, resource bindings, pub/sub, 
distributed tracing and others. Even though there is some overlap in the
 capabilities provided by Dapr and Service Mesh, both are very different
 in nature. Envoy with Istio is injected and runs transparently from the
 service and represents an operational tool. Dapr, on the other hand, 
has to be called explicitly from the application runtime over HTTP or 
gRPC and it is an explicit sidecar targeted for developers. It is a 
library for distributed primitives that is distributed and consumed as a
 sidecar, a model that may become very attractive for developers 
consuming distributed capabilities.</p>
<h3>Camel K</h3>
<p>Apache Camel is a mature integration library that rediscovers itself on Kubernetes. Its subproject <a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Camel K</a>
 uses heavily the operator model to improve the developer experience and
 integrate deeply with the Kubernetes platform. While Camel K does not 
rely on a sidecar, through its CLI and operator it is able to reuse the 
same application container and execute any local code modification in a 
remote Kubernetes cluster in less than a second. This is another example
 of developer-targeted software consumption through the operator model.</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>And these are only some of the pioneer projects exploring various 
approaches through sidecars and operators. There is more work being done
 to reduce the networking overhead introduced by container-based 
distributed architectures such as the data plane development kit (<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">DPDK</a>),
 which is a userspace application that bypasses the layers of the Linux 
kernel networking stack and access directly to the network hardware. 
There is work in the Kubernetes project to create <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753" rel="external" target="_blank">sidecar</a> containers with more granular lifecycle guarantees. There are new Java projects based on GraalVM implementation such as <a href="https://quarkus.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Quarkus</a>
 that reduce the resource consumption and application startup time which
 makes more workloads attractive for sidecars. All of these innovations 
will make the side-car model more attractive and enable the creation of 
even more such projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ajKfxQnN7Eg/Xs1961D9WzI/AAAAAAAAORs/_hu-KhmUN1wsQ8PfeIaNKaHNVyi8-3iYACK4BGAsYHg/d/multiruntine1.png"><img alt="Sidecars Providing Distributed Systems Primitives" data-original-height="944" data-original-width="1670" height="226" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ajKfxQnN7Eg/Xs1961D9WzI/AAAAAAAAORs/_hu-KhmUN1wsQ8PfeIaNKaHNVyi8-3iYACK4BGAsYHg/w400-h226/multiruntine1.png" title="Sidecars Providing Distributed Systems Primitives" width="400"></a></p><p>Sidecars providing distributed systems primitives</p>
<p>I’d not be surprised to see projects coming up around more specific 
use cases such as stateful orchestration of long-running processes such 
as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) engines in sidecars. Job 
schedulers in sidecars. Stateless integration engines i.e. Enterprise 
Integration Patterns implementations in sidecars. Data abstractions and 
data <a href="https://github.com/teiid/teiid-operator" rel="external" target="_blank">federation</a> engines in sidecars. OAuth2/<a href="https://github.com/louketo/louketo-proxy" rel="external" target="_blank">OpenID</a>
 proxy in sidecars. Scalable database connection pools for serverless 
workloads in sidecars. Application networks as sidecars, etc. But why 
would software vendors and developers switch to this model? Let’s see a 
few of the benefits it provides.</p>
<h2>Runtimes with Control Planes over Libraries</h2>
<p>If you are a software vendor today, probably you have already 
considered offering your software to potential users as an API or a 
SaaS-based solution. This is the fastest software consumption model and a
 no-brainer to offer, when possible. Depending on the nature of the 
software you may be also distributing your software as a library or a 
runtime framework. Maybe it is time to consider if it can be offered as a
 container with an operator too. This mechanism of distributing software
 and the resulting architecture has some very unique benefits that the 
library mechanism cannot offer.</p>
<h3>Supporting Polyglot Consumers</h3>
<p>By offering libraries to be consumable through open protocols and 
standards, you open them up for all programming languages. A library 
that runs as a sidecar and consumable over HTTP, using a text format 
such as JSON does not require any specific client runtime library. Even 
when gRPC and Protobuf are used for low-latency and high-performance 
interactions, it is still easier to generate such clients than including
 third party custom libraries in the application runtime and implement 
certain interfaces.</p>
<h3>Application Architecture Agnostic</h3>
<p>The explicit sidecar architecture (as opposed to the transparent one)
 is a way of software capability consumption as a separate runtime 
behind a developer-focused API. It is an orthogonal feature that can be 
added to any application whether that is monolithic, microservices, 
functions-based, actor-based or anything in between. It can sit next to a
 monolith in a less dynamic environment, or next to every microservice 
in a dynamic cloud-based environment. It is trivial to create sidecars 
on Kubernetes, and doable on many other software orchestration platforms
 too.</p>
<h3>Tolerant to Release Impedance Mismatch</h3>
<p>Business logic is always custom and developed in house. Distributed 
system primitives are well-known commodity features, and consumed 
off-the-shelf as either platform features or runtime libraries. You 
might be consuming software for state abstractions, messaging clients, 
networking resiliency and monitoring libraries, etc. from third-party 
open source projects or companies. And these third party entities have 
their release cycles, critical fixes, CVE patches that impact your 
software release cycles too. When third party libraries are consumed as a
 separate runtime (sidecar), the upgrade process is simpler as it is 
behind an API and it is not coupled with your application runtime. The 
release impedance mismatch between your team and the consumed 3rd party 
libraries vendors becomes easier to manage.</p>
<h3>Control Plane Included Mentality</h3>
<p>When a feature is consumed as a library, it is included in your 
application runtime and it becomes your responsibility to understand how
 it works, how to configure, monitor, tune and upgrade. That is because 
the language runtimes (such as the JVM) and the runtime frameworks (such
 as Spring Boot or application servers) dictate how a third-party 
library can be included, …</p></div></div>

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [PHP-DEV] Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows</p>
<p>My name is Dale Hirt and I am the project manager for PHP inside Microsoft. <br>
We are not, however, going to be supporting PHP for Windows in any capacity for version 8.0 and beyond.</p>
<p>Hi Dale! <br>
First, let me convey all our appreciation for the work Microsoft has put into supporting PHP on Windows over the years.  Thank you also for letting us know in advance to not expect 8.0 builds.  I guess this decision must have only been made very recently since 8.0.0alpha1 and alpha2 builds were produced already.</p>
<p>I won't say I'm not bummed, of course.  Nevertheless, y'all gotta do what you gotta do.  I'm sure we can work out an alternative by the end of the year.</p>
<p>All the best, <br>

But to the onlooker, they clearly stand apart.&nbsp;</p>    <p>In the latest episode of <em>More&nbsp;with Anna Maria Tremonti</em>, it also becomes clear that Gehry sees his buildings as a way to bring people together,&nbsp;and sees his own role in life as much more than an architect. In a wide-sweeping conversation, he traces his craft back to the days when his grandmother would encourage him to build cities out of&nbsp;wood blocks&nbsp;for the fire — an act of imagination he's adapted for&nbsp;students of today.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>The following excerpt from their conversation has been condensed for length and clarity. Find the full interview here or on your favourite podcast app.</em></p>  <p><strong>As I listen to you I hear that you are so much more than an architect. That you care&nbsp;about more than the building of buildings.</strong></p>  <p>I do, yeah. Well I grew up that way.</p>  <p>You know my grandfather used to read Talmud to me. I don't think he was&nbsp;sellout religious. He was just interested in the philosophy. And Talmud starts with the word "Why." It's about curiosity. And I think that is really important. You've got to be curious.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Buildings are backgrounds for activity but the activity has to be&nbsp;a life, a thing. It's got to be more than just making money. It's a cultural thing and it brings people together to talk to each other, live together, work together. So, just the building alone is not that relevant.</p>  <p><strong>Do you think that most architects understand that? Most people?</strong></p>  <p>Not most.&nbsp;I don't think so.</p>  <p>Although architects tend to be idealists. They start out very idealistic. They want to make the world better. Most of the architects I know and work with have an idealistic base.

Those early days when you were a kid.</strong></p>  <p>Okay, so now you're gonna make me cry. Well my grandparents were great. My grandmother brought the wood blocks home for the fire, for the wood stove. And she would throw them on the floor and make cities with me.</p>    <p>And I don't know why she decided to do that. Architecture wasn't in any part of our family at that time. So that was an&nbsp;important memory.</p>  <p>My father was not educated at all. He probably didn't even go to school. He was living on the streets in New York — Tenth Avenue. His father was a tailor who came from Russia and is actually buried in Toronto. And his name was Frank Goldberg. So there is a Frank Goldberg buried in a cemetery in Toronto — that's my grandfather.</p>  <p>Anyway, so my father ...&nbsp;had a heart attack at 49. He lost everything. And his brother moved him to L.A.</p>  <p>We got here and we were very poor because he had lost everything. But he became a truck driver and I became a truck driver. I was 17 or 18. Now, after he's gone — he died at 63 or something like that — I've seen evidence now that I find in some of the things he left behind, that we never looked at really until recently, and it's pretty clear that he had an artistic bent and that that's what he liked doing.</p>  <p>He would paint toys for people. He would make things.&nbsp;I remember him drawing with me but he never got to see what I started to do. By time I was an architect, he was out of it.</p>  <p><strong>What do you think you would have thought of your work? Would he have been proud of you?</strong></p>  <p>He would be shocked and proud. I think, yeah. I liked that thought.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>So, what advice do you give to your son as he tries to carve his own path?</strong></p>  <p>Just stay curious. Do where your head takes you. And be conscious of the people who are working with you and the people who are you're working for and the importance of what you do in relation to your contribution to what's going on around us.</p>  <p><strong>That sounds like advice you could give to lots of people.</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. Well, I'm not holier than thou about it.&nbsp;I know that I just live that way. But there's a lot of different ways to live and still be creative and still be part of the world and still be doing important things. So my way is not the only example.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Well, I think in these times though it's nice to hear you know to connect the work you do and the wider concept of architecture to the idea of humanity and being humane.</strong> <strong>I think it's a really important thing to hear from you.</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. But I think the history of architecture shows that that was prevalent from the beginning.</p>  <p>You know all the great artists of the Renaissance became architects. So Giotto was a great painter, became an architect. El Greco was a great painter, became an architect. Architecture was treated as an art in those times.</p>    <p>After the war here architecture became less of an art and more&nbsp;engineering issues and financial issues. And not that they're not important but that became the driver. Not the humanity of it. And that's why our cities are kind of the way they are I think. And the cities look the same all over the world.

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>

<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>

<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

<p>We can tell docker to expose port from container on docker host port that other server or clients can access service running in container.<br>
We can achive this with <code>--publish</code> flag.</p>
<h2 id="start-container-with-port-published">Start container with port published</h2>
<p>We start container with <code>httpd</code> service which expose port 80 - to connect to this port in container we can connect to docker host on port 1234.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Docker gives us possibility to integrate container network stack into host stack.<br>
In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>If we want to expose our container to world but it is important for us that container has got own IP and MAC adress from network where docker host is connected, we can use MACVLAN network driver. It allows also to connect to certain VLAN.</p>
<p>It will create for us docker network - all containers connected to this network will be visible in docker host network as they were normal separate from docker host that host them machines.</p>
<p>Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>with MACVLAN you can easily exhaust IP adresses in your network</li>
<li>you have to set network card in promiscious mode</li>
<li>this solution is created mainly for legacy apps or network monitoring apps</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="important">Important!</h3>
<p>To use MACVLAN mode our network card has to be in promiscious mode!<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are several ways to host an application on the internet, but the one that I am most familiar with is to use a web server such as Apache or NGINX where you can host all the static components of your application and also use it as a reverse proxy server to direct API calls.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>But recently I came across another way to host a web application which is more elegant, cost effective and has no need for maintenance. This method makes use of AWS S3 and AWS Cloudfront and it’s turned out to be significantly easier to set up, scales infinitely and is cheaper than the alternative.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Why did we need S3 to host a web application?</strong><br></h4><p>The <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">product</a> that I have built is currently architected in this way - we use an open source version of Nginx that is hosted on an AWS VPS instance which takes care of hosting our static files for our web app and also works as a reverse proxy server to send API calls to our backend applications.</p><p>This setup worked great so far because we have a limited number of users that need access to the application dashboard and there is no need for a CDN either because the users, especially the ones on a paid plan do not have any problem waiting a couple of seconds more for the website to load.</p><p>This requirement changed when there was a new feature requirement within our product. Our users are e-commerce merchants and most of them accept “Cash on delivery” as an option while accepting orders and this leaves a lot of room for fraud to occur where somebody places an order and selects the payment method as “Cash on delivery” without the intention to actually buy the product.</p><p>In order to fix this we introduced a feature where the customer who places a COD order gets an automated message on WhatsApp to confirm their order via a link.</p><figure id="w-node-c4a1f5223dce-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c3967fc45b644bd89_23sxkg2VnH0KczPacTa60TpnJXRd675pY-TD7m1i8DzhDDZvosqX5cXv9tXTpgyHrF6Rd_PM_-xv37qWKFQOsc6Bx818rC_OcCfJxhfHC-FojE8HjpC9EXqQL_jVq8DJbeIynX31.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Automated WhatsApp message to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on this link would open this web page</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-11a95fb1ed82-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951bd3ce595371f24095_FScpPINWKrHotUgTY8aLaV9wlay9dcXXurWkK_Ce-jcsF07e5bxofrU9qjaSspkf5UvCAE40CvgKZ57KouSas0GsPBF_RHbLppjgiOhpGqLN0LbQiVIGd0f7yV9pw9pc2g5t6nEP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Reactjs web app used to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Now this web page would be accessed by the customers that buy from the merchants that use our application, so the traffic to this page could be very erratic, not to mention the fact that it would come from various parts of the world where the users internet connection would also be erratic and vary according to the region.</p><p>Therefore it did not make sense to host this web page the way the rest of our application is hosted. This web app had the following requirements</p><ul role="list"><li>High availability from any part of the world</li><li>Fast load time</li><li>Ability to handle any amount of traffic</li><li>Not having the need to manage or monitor</li></ul><p>It turns out that all of these things can be achieved if you host the app using a combination of S3 and CloudFront which is the CDN offered by AWS.</p><h4><strong>How to host an application on s3</strong><br></h4><p>There is a comprehensive guide in the AWS documentation on how to do this - <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html" target="_blank">link to documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The TL:DR for this is to Create an s3 bucket with the same name as the domain/subdomain where you want to host your web app.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, our web page had to be hosted on<a href="http://cod.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> cod.superlemon.xyz</a>, so this is what the s3 bucket would be called. After this there are a bunch of properties and settings that you would have to change on the bucket which are mentioned in the doc.&nbsp;</p><p>Once this is done, you can test whether it worked or not by using either of the below links based on the region where you are hosted</p><figure id="w-node-30ce7d6ec647-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c849c2b0521c7c2f0_AToH07QToYYzbJ9Hj3iliaW3JMuv0_jHNoaEopFciAvlAf-Ajqr0VpnnKS22_3du4E4vmnV-5Eh3fLajnyQ48kEFHFGjwpKVa_wTl7EXOQu2ZrOX_OgbBq1ba08CWAgeUKTuN0no.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>End points for verifying if the s3 hosting worked or not</figcaption></figure><p>Though the steps in the AWS doc are quite comprehensive, there is one gotcha here that you must keep in mind. If your web app runs on a framework like react which is what we are using, you must make sure that under the “static website hosting” settings of the AWS bucket, you set the index document as well as error document as index.html.</p><figure id="w-node-bc6f0af8aa89-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951ce32edcd6fc8e8c88_JNhV0zwqHr-nOGJWip4t3WDyp9wB8Ld7aXF3KHr30jHAeKpRQVkB_gUIG-Z911vMOLNRZplgM7vUasVAs5Wm7NUtxkTZS6-HI9YzPh2I78EAwCEezHDfzxR08lDBQu7z4aLBhXSX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>S3 static web hosting settings</figcaption></figure><p>This is to ensure that if you have any URL routes set up in your react application, those routes are honoured.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How to put the s3 application behind a CDN</strong><br></h4><p>The above step only completes one step of the process where your application is now residing in s3. But the process is only complete if the application is accessible as a CDN. For this you would have to use CloudFront and configure it to use your s3 bucket as the source. A comprehensive documentation for this process is given <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few gotchas here as well. The first one being that you will require an SSL certificate to host your application as <strong>https://</strong>. You can get an SSL certificate easily using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/" target="_blank">AWS Certificate manager</a>. This process becomes even more easy if you are using Route53 to manage your domains and subdomains. Even if you use another provider like Godaddy or Bigrock for your domains, I would highly recommend following <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html#migrate-dns-change-name-servers-with-provider" target="_blank">these steps</a> to plug in your domains to Route53.&nbsp;</p><p>The other gotcha here is once again something to do with reactjs URL routing. If you are using this in your application, there is another step that you have to follow. Under your CloudFront distribution, you must navigate to error pages and create a new custom error response as follows</p><figure id="w-node-a5d3bf85872d-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c40228a0a31b66d85_Xtn0dT_NkHLal0TU8T9vqg_t9AGSxaLs9wvMlIbGxfXCIrH7coSBdYVtZQdkiJJI6oj6WtfPpMjYius2H4gDZrX1_29_TwlPOiHrWeB24cS65VzitHgu9yK5U43S0ByQf3Z4l7uc.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront distribution error pages settings</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-283c3bc077ec-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c8fbf67d9dc26bd63_XTsEDUFowLfUmq3r3YixmsOrB-fMsmIqSr2r5HiymcBaBxt79EQiVT-1qZM3Aps7l27IZNzbSDSxRCZ-FV7HPUu3utQckFitE1tjnr_Stn9YA_HSgjwjB-rQwiD6lC48o0BhiBVg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront distribution handling 403 error</figcaption></figure><p>This will ensure that if the CDN is not able to find the URL path you specify, it will default to index.html which will handle the routing in case of a reactjs application.&nbsp;</p><p>After finishing all these steps you will receive a url for your CloudFront distribution that looks something like this -<a href="https://dohgltcrfo5nj.cloudfront.net/" target="_blank"> dohgltcrfo5nj.cloudfront.net</a>. You just need to use this URL as an alias and map it to your domain/subdomain which in our case is<a href="http://cod.superlemon.xyz/" target="_blank"> cod.superlemon.xyz</a></p><figure id="w-node-ec229573544f-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951ccd92d9716216562a_S_OJrarz5VxJWIVBHKu-wpg2Ine5qGjwdGzIb0Ban3S5Ya41_TbycPcpfnL5IQbu73mNS7oMmqNsrTQjatzC1qUSgsuy5q_CGEL25PITgZlWNJ3xUouo0G-DkloWeR_zPIfW9qA2.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Route53 subdomain targeting</figcaption></figure><p>And that’s it, it's done! You now have a highly available application which does not need to be monitored or managed. Once you launch your application this way, it is now on a CDN and if you have to update the application in the future, the CDN cache must be invalidated for the changes to take effect. This can be done under the “invalidations” tab.</p><figure id="w-node-4a1c808b9f87-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c64584095bc4b3701_5oYoQ3CFjxE69GyZKHZ1HlboCYnrtEcRAZok14fLisD0VU7JCm1s3416Q5roMUIWFy-XX7PzNWwXQ3ogLygpMhV1AsPciPjqGAs9E9Dyx1drA9qLf6GmDCN_1otqPOhMwJ3ep9ei.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>CloudFront cache invalidation</figcaption></figure><p>Then supply all the paths that have been updated and you would like the CDN cache to invalidate.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I just wanted to write this to start the conversation in order to disrupt amateur radio’s status quo, in response to K0NR’s blog, “<em><a href="http://www.k0nr.com/wordpress/2017/11/internet-destroying-amateur-radio/">Is The Internet Destroying Amateur Radio?</a></em>” This was a great analysis by Bob, and it really paints a picture of the current state of the hobby, including the apparent distaste for internet-connected amateur radio technologies.</p>
<p>And also because nobody else has had an article with this title, so why not?&nbsp; Despite being clickbait, the title isn’t wrong. Millennials are definitely killing ham radio, just like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8">they’re killing everything else.</a> Here’s how.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I am 25 years old. Also and this blog is a rant, full of unverifiable anecdotes and wild propositions, probably a few spelling errors, and many incoherent thoughts. Opinions are my own. QRZ OM’s beware.</p>

<p>The Hobbiest Computer movement of the 80s (all of you with a TRS-80) is now the hacker/maker movement, automating life with microcontrollers, tiny computers, and data centers.</p>
<p>Amateur radio is to The Baby Boomer and Generation X’s youth as IOT is to Millennials and Gen Y.</p>
<p>Interest in “talking to people on the radio” is waning; it’s about talking to machines, and enabling machines to talk to us. That’s why the maker movement is such a hit, especially now as commercial entities have also entered the fray with off the shelf IoT devices. I’m thankful for the the ARRL for realizing this critical market, and repping ham radio at many Makerfaires and Hackercons.</p>

<p>China controls hardware development and manufacturing. We (the US (Silicon Valley)) specialize in software. Homebrewing hardware from scratch isn’t going to be a thing in the next 20 years, because the ashes of failed electronic appliances from which many a ham radio Phoenix was born are no longer durable, salvageable, salvageable goods – once dead and broken, they’re trash.</p>
<p>Now is the time of software homebrewing, and the idea of ham radio as a means to an end.</p>
<p>The evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heathkit, despite their resurrection, can’t figure their $h!+ out. They just can’t. Other kit companies (like Ramsey) have shut down, as well as Radioshack.</li>
<li>Elecraft stopped making thru-hole kits in favor of assembly projects with pre-populated surface-mount PCBs. Many other outfits stopped kit building entirely, because it’s just cheaper to have China do all of the fab and assembly.</li>
<li>Software defined radio, in general, is dominating the radio communications market, both from a hobbyist perspective (RTLSDR, HackRF), an academic one (GNURadio, USRP) to commercial and military (to name a few: cell phones, airband radios; weather, civil air, and tactical radar systems; radio observatories;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network">&nbsp;MANET</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Tactical_Information_Distribution_System">JTIDS</a>)</li>
<li>The non-traditional sense of ham radio is quickly becoming a centerpiece, if not a regular side-item, of <a href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a>&nbsp;articles, makerspaces, and makerfaires.</li>
</ol>
<p>However,&nbsp; I will admit the <a href="https://heilsound.com/amateur-radio-post/the-pine-board-project/">Ham Nation Pineboard project</a> is particularly popular, and is doing a great thing bringing tubes back into focus and captivating/inspiring viewers to try it themselves, but I’m going out on a limb saying it’s probably most popular with their target demographic…a young person might be following along but it’s not changing the face of the hobby anytime soon. One of the student members of&nbsp; W0EEE (Missouri S&amp;T) is a die-hard tube fanatic, but to everyone else, he’s the tube guy.</p>
<p>Speaking of which – target demographic. The target demographic of every single amateur radio show, podcast, club, media outlet, society, magazine, livestream, or otherwise, is not young people.</p>
<p>The ARRL however, has been making a lot of good strides to engage the new generation of hams (<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-expands-initiative-to-fire-up-collegiate-amateur-radio-clubs">1</a>)(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/arrlhq/">2</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-now-on-snapchat">3</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-represented-at-world-maker-fair-in-new-york-city-school-club-to-exhibit">4</a>), yet still, the ARRL can only do so much to interest younger people, which takes away resources from engaging their demographic core of white male retirees.&nbsp; For example – why no youth editor? I was the last one, before my editor, Khrystyne K1SFA, left the ARRL, which left a hole requiring them to kill the Youth Editor (<a href="http://n0ssc.com/blogs/arrlyouthcolumns">the articles still remain on their website</a>), and The Amateur Amateur (<a href="http://gary-ross-hoffman.com/Ham/index.html">which still exists at his website</a>). But why no top-level Youth Coordinator? Why not a report on the effort of, or a collaboration between, our Section Youth Coordinators in the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-organization">ARRL Field Organization Structure</a>? Are we all just relying on <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/carole-perry-wb2mgp-set-to-host-her-30th-hamvention-youth-forum">Carole Perry</a>‘s and the late <a href="http://oralhistory.boulderlibrary.org/interview/oh1264/">Ellie and Rip Van Winkel’s</a>&nbsp;of the ham radio world to inspire and educate young people about ham radio? Surely there’s opportunity for ARRL, as well as every ham radio club out there.</p>

<p>No. From my experience over the last seven years, digital Amateur Radio is not intrinsically exciting to young people, as many have been touting. It is a lot better than voice and CW, but still exists the fact that as an individual, it’s a troubling process to decide where to spend your (mother’s) money – $300 on a DSTAR radio, $100 for a DMR, both full of people talking about how robotic they sound, or $400 for an HF station to do digital data modes, full of canned responses (PSK31) or hardly any response at all (FT8).</p>
<p>These are also communication between people, which begs the titular question posed by K0NR. People-to-people communication is trivial, and although some young hams (me) find it really cool to talk to people beyond shouting distance with the raw elements of a radio station,what’s much more interesting and impactful to the next generation is is the idea of people-to-machine communication. In other words, Digital Voice is dumb, Digital Data is smart, and the only ways to utilize digital data are explicitly NOT provided by the commercial manufacturers of amateur radio(1), but instead by Adafruit, Ubiquiti; HackRF, RFSpace, and USRP; and soon <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">FaradayRF</a>, among others.</p>

<h2>Remote Operating for HF</h2>
<p>Here’s where I disagree with K0NR’s analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, we can’t really stop the impact of new technology. Oh, I suppose the amateur radio community could petition the FCC to restrict [internet assisted] use of ham radio. There could be regulations that limit the use of the internet being interconnected with Part 97 radio operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that remote operating, and other internet-assisted means of ham radio operation, are critical to youth engagement.</p>
<p>RemoteHamRadio is the shining example of where ham radio operating is heading. they have an awesome <a href="http://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/">Youth Program</a>, allowing young people that are:</p>
<p>– 25 years old or younger<br>– A General class or higher license<br>– A member of the ARRL<br>– Interested in or Experienced with in DXing/Contesting</p>
<p>to operate remote online stations for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.remotehams.com/">Remote Hams</a> is a totally free alternative, but it’s up to the host to restrict operation, which is frustrating when you’re clicking through servers, only to find it’s locked by membership to whatever radio club is hosting it.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a> and <a href="http://sdr.hu/openwebrx">OpenWebRX</a> are always open to everyone to receive tons of spectrum, remotely.</p>
<p>Despite that, it’s ultimately a much MUCH better solution in the short term for young hams to operate remotely, than it is to persuade their mom’s to fork up a relative ton of money for a radio, antenna, a pole if no trees are around…etc.</p>
<p>Because young people do not often have access to the the kind of money an HF radio station requires, I strongly believe to captivate more young people, we need to do more of one of these two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Promote your club’s shack, your own shack to young people.</li>
<li>Put your shack on a remote service provider for others to use when you’re not.</li>
</ol>
<p>For young people to join the hobby, it’s critically important to&nbsp;<strong>bring ham radio where the young people are,&nbsp;</strong>which is, for the most part, the internet.</p>
<p>If I knew this when I was younger, my mom would have been around $900 richer!</p>
<h2>Ham Radio Hackathons</h2>
<p>One thing I’m thinking of&nbsp; starting up are Ham Radio Hackathons. I mentioned it<a href="http://n0ssc.com/posts/560-ham-radio-analysis-paralysis"> in a previous blog</a> which has surprisingly gotten a lot of traction with my <a href="http://n0ssc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/T2miAyF.png">tiny contingent of readers</a>.</p>
<p>A hackathon isn’t a coding competition. It’s explained well in <a href="https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601">this Medium article.</a> It goes even further than that, not limited to coders and engineers, but open to thinkers, doers, philosophers, system engineers, math people, teachers, students, artists, stakeholders…anyone with an interest in <strong>solving a problem with technology. </strong></p>
<p>Ham radio has a bunch of problems with technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s far behind the curve. We’re spitting out digital modes faster than K9PG can work a sweep, but compared to what’s already on the shelf, why would anyone bother with ham radio?</li>
<li>When I think about software like Log4OM, LOTW, eQSL, and HRD, I get frustrated. It’s great software, and many volunteer hours have poured into their development, but it’s so feature dense, developed in vacuums, hard to use, buggy, and lacking in UX.&nbsp; A good example of software is Fldigi – it’s fast, and light…hence *<strong>FL*</strong>digi. APRS is really nifty, especially <a href="http://aprs.fi/">aprs.fi</a>, but a person needs too much stuff or really expensive radios to get on it via RF (most people seem to be going direct to APRS-IS anyway) and getting into the development side of it is making me pull my hair out, just starting with the fact it’s based on the Bell 202 modem invented in 1972!!! Are you $#!++!n&amp; me!? I mean, what a fantastic utilization of resources…in 1978. <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">It’s time for something fresh, now.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>There are dozens of ham radio websites stuck in 1990 (two of them are in K0NR’s blog (<a href="http://www.on4kst.com/index.php">1</a>)(<a href="http://www.pingjockey.net/">2</a>)…I’d&nbsp; almost argue that ham radio is killing the internet!), it seems like every ham radio developer has to repeatedly reinventing the wheel with logging programs, everyone still uses email reflectors, tons of ham radio apps just crash upon startup, the Digital Voice debate (when we should really focus on digital data, breaking through the baudrate limitation, and interlinking everything), the logistical challenges of testing (3 VEs to proctor a test in person, c’mon…that’s not to say I don’t disagree with the lack of practical on-the-air knowledge in the newbie amateur radio generation; however I don’t think that’s not a fault of the amateur, that’s a fault on the lack of elmership to personally show them how it’s done).</li>
<li>What gets us …</li></ol></div></div>

<p><span>In today’s world of plug-and-play peripheral devices, it is difficult to understand the fundamentals of what is happening at the lower levels.<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the computer connect to the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does it communicate with the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the software make the device do its magic?</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Eric Rangell and I was a teenager in the 1980s.<span>&nbsp; </span>My first computer was an Apple //e in 1983.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before my family got a computer, I learned Basic programming from my brother’s college textbook and practiced writing programs on paper for a year before the Apple found a home in my brother’s room.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the limited computer time I had, I practiced coding, debugging, and refining my programs until they did what I wanted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Apple ][ series of computers was designed so that owners could learn everything about how their machines worked if they took the time to study the available documentation and experiment with the machine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today, early Apple computers can help young people grasp the fundamentals of how a computer works, and that will help them as they progress in their studies and careers.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article I will walk through a simple project that can be built using an Apple ][ series computer that has an internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>It uses one of the Annunciator digital outputs to send MIDI data to a MIDI instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The process of building it and persisting through any problems you encounter will give you a sense of mastery and enjoyment, give you a tool to express your creativity, and challenge you to continue tinkering with the project as you learn more advanced computer science concepts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Parents and teachers are encouraged to learn how to build this project and help children work through it as they build an electronic device, write simple programs in Basic to control the device, and imagine additional applications that can use the device.</span></p>
<p><span>MIDI can play notes and music on keyboard synthesizers, as well as send commands to modules which control music playback, drum patterns, and even lighting.<span>&nbsp; </span>MIDI uses a very simple communication protocol to send binary messages to instruments.<span>&nbsp; </span>There really is nothing magical about it – the computer is just sending bytes which represent commands such as “Play a middle C”, “Stop playing the middle C”, “Change the instrument sound to Violin”, “Change the volume”.<span>&nbsp; </span>The objective of this project is for the student to understand how the computer varies voltage levels on an output port using specific timings according to a protocol that the musical instrument receiving the data understands.<span>&nbsp; </span>By building the interface from scratch, the student knows that the data is traveling on wires that they connected, and controlled by software that they wrote, using a driver program that is conceptually easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start building the interface, read this entire article and gather the parts you need.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many modern musical instruments have USB interfaces for MIDI.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look for older synthesizer keyboards with the round 5 pin DIN MIDI sockets, or USB MIDI interfaces that have the round connectors.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may need a MIDI coupler in order to connect a MIDI cable to one of those interfaces.</span></p>

<p><span>The following pictures illustrate various options for connecting the game socket to a breadboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep track of which pins on the external connector correspond to which pins on the internal connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the Apple //gs, pin 1 is in the upper left corner of the socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>For all other Apples, pin 1 is in the lower right corner of the socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins are numbered from pin 1 to pin 8, then pin 9 is on the opposite side of pin 8, then pins 9-16 are numbered using the remaining pins.</span></p>

<p><span><b>Testing your wiring</b></span></p>
<p><span>Before you proceed any further, you want to make sure all wires are properly connected and that the signals from the Apple are reaching the breadboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>While there are only 3 pins needed to build the MIDI interface project, take the time to test the additional signals available on the Internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>All pin numbers below refer to pin numbers on the Internal Game I/O socket.</span></p>

<p><span>1. Test the voltage between +5V (pin 1) and GND (pin 8).<span>&nbsp; </span>Use a multimeter to verify that the voltage level coming to the breadboard is at least +5 volts. The red wire connects pin 1 to the side holes for Power and the green wire connects pin 8 to side holes for Ground. Connect the probes of the multimeter to the Power and Ground of the breadboard, and set the dial to measure voltage.</span></p>

<p><span>2.

<p><span>You can also test the logic of the </span><span>Annunciators using a Digital Logic Probe, as shown left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Connect the probe terminals to the +5V and GND signals on the breadboard, then touch the tip of the probe to the Annunciator pin.<span>&nbsp; </span>The photos below show how the Digital Logic Probe responds when it detects logical HIGH and logical LOW voltages on Annunciator 0.</span></p>




<p><span><b>Inverters and Buffers</b></span></p>
<p><span>The MIDI specification defines the MIDI OUT Circuit as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>The signal from the transmitting device (labeled UART in the diagram below-left) passes through 2 inverters, then a 220 Ohm resistor, and is sent to Pin 5 on the circular 5 pin DIN connector labelled MIDI OUT.<span>&nbsp; </span>The +5V signal is sent through a 220 Ohm resistor to Pin 4 of the MIDI OUT connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pin 2 is connected to Ground, and the shield of the MIDI cable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins 1 and 3 are not connected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Polarity matters because a MIDI cable will connect your MIDI OUT port to the MIDI IN port of a musical instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The signals sent on your MIDI OUT port need to drive a phototransistor inside an opto-isolator in the MIDI IN circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the signal from the UART is negative, the current loop is completed and the opto-isolator receives the signal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Communication is established by following a timing protocol for flipping the signals to represent the bits and bytes of MIDI messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this project we will control the timing of the messages with the Apple’s 6502 timing, to illustrate that there is nothing magical going on – if we get the timing right and follow the protocol, we will successfully communicate with a MIDI instrument.</span></p>

<p><span>Inverters change the input signal from HIGH to LOW, or LOW to HIGH.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, two inverters will leave the input signal unchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two inverters form a buffer, which ensures that the signal does not get degraded if voltage fluctuates due to additional loads on the circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>While it may be possible to drive the signal directly from the Apple without using the buffers, that introduces an element of uncertainty that can make your device unreliable under certain conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>So initially we will build the circuit with two inverters (following the MIDI spec), and then test modifying it to use only one inverter (by logically inverting all the signals sent by the driver software).</span></p>

<p><span>There are several integrated circuit chips that can be used to build the buffer needed for this circuit:</span></p>
<p><span>4001: QUAD NOR – contains 4 NOR (NOT OR) gates</span></p>
<p><span>4011: QUAD NAND – contains 4 NAND (NOT AND) gates</span></p>
<p><span>7404: HEX INVERTER – contains 6 inverter circuits.</span></p>
<p><span>The two breadboards above show the three chips that may be used for this project.<span>&nbsp; </span>The left breadboard shows the 4011 chip on top and 4001 chip on the bottom.<span>&nbsp; </span>The right breadboard shows …</span></p></div></div>
