<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Today the consumer market is moving towards Omni-channel experience, and the developer and UX designers need to focus more on web and mobile-friendly user experience than ever before. The developer and designer work more closely to provide a better user experience for the website or app they develop. Technical errors on the software are the critical reason for the app deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 90% of the downloaded apps are erased after one use due to poor user experience. Similarly, according to expert's studies, 80% of users never return to a low user experience website. This is why UX design is a crucial factor in software or application development. The user expects extraordinary experience on apps, websites they use every day. They never provide 2nd change on the software. In this article, let's look in detail at why developers want to learn UI/UX design.</p><p>‍</p><p>The 15 reasons I've highlighted here for you:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>Interface vs. Experience</li><li>How User Experience Shapes Software Development</li><li>Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</li><li>Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</li><li>Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</li><li>Limited Resource</li><li>Designing in the Browser</li><li>Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</li><li>&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</li><li>Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</li><li>&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</li><li>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</li><li>Execute Your Code Towards the User Experience</li><li>User Empathy Will Help You Stand Out in the Business Market</li></ol><h2>1. Interface vs. Experience</h2><p>Before we get down to detail, let's understand the difference between the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>User Interface is anything that the user interacts with the website or app. In another term, UI is the point where the user interacts with the digital product or service. They come in three categories Graphical user interfaces( GUIs), Voice-controlled interface (VUIs), and Gesture-based interfaces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Graphical user interfaces:</strong> Users interact with electronic devices through graphic icons. The best example is the computer's desktop.</p><p><strong>Voice-controlled interface: </strong>Users interact with the application through their voices. E.g., Siri, Alexa, etc.</p><p><strong>Gesture-based interface: </strong>Users engage with 3D design spaces through real movements, e.g., Virtual reality (VR) games.</p><p>In contrast, User Experience is the complete look and feel of the website or application. UX is the final impression of the user about the product or service.</p><h2>2. How User Experience Shapes Software Development</h2><p>UX and UI design are essential for any application development. Five significant reasons show you need to focus more on the design during product development. Research says that the product's experience influences 97% of customer decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Usability</strong></p><p>When software or application works great but is not user-friendly, people will not prefer to use it. The software has to attract and retain the user. User interface and experience are upfront on the development.</p><p><strong>2. Lower development costs</strong></p><p>Identifying the roadblocks and issues in the client experience before development with save you time on modifying code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Faster development time</strong></p><p>Great UX and UI configuration save time in the development cycle.</p><p><strong>4. Increase revenue</strong></p><p>People prefer to download or ready to pay for the application that suits their needs and easy to use. If you develop a product with useful UI and UX will increase the app's purchase or downloading.</p><p><strong>5. Better Client retention</strong></p><p>User-friendly apps will keep people returning. The application will become an integral part of their everyday life. If developing a poor UX will leave a lasting impression. The developer has to identify the design problems before deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</h2><p>UX design offers insights about what your users want from the product that you are developing. It is the core point for product design. User research and usability testing at each step of the development prove how the user-friendly product evolved.</p><div><p>Before product development, conduct user research and speak with the end-users and understand their needs. The study will help to develop the best user experience application or software.</p><p>In the end the builders (in this case developers) need to have an understanding of the outcome of what they’re building.</p></div><h2>4. Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</h2><p>According to statistics, nearly 67% of consumers are more likely to purchase the product if they are happy with their user experience.</p><p>Creating a straightforward user journey or planning the best end-user experience makes client retention and retains the existing customers. This boost in product purchase.</p><p><a href="https://bugreporting.co/">BugReporting</a> is a user feedback tool for websites and apps. It allows users to record full-length video feedback. The application also captures the data to replicate any errors that users face. A BugReporting software is an automatic tool that helps developers and designers view the exact bugs that are user-facing on the UI/UX.</p><h2>5. Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</h2><p>When you combine user's demands in your application's development process, it will considerably decrease UX problems in the later stage of the product journey.</p><p>A basic understanding of UX design will help understand which will not work for the user before product development. Mockups and prototypes will reduce user-related bugs' chances, and it will minimize the development cycle time. The developers can make a clear decision on software development with prototyping.</p><h2>6. Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</h2><p>High performance and software stability can only be achieved by the developers. These two are the unsung heroes of user experience design.</p><p>For example, Website visitors will leave the page if they face low page loading. Unnecessary redirects, server delays, heavy images, heavy CSS, HTML, JavaScript files, fancy animated effects or page widgets, etc., may cause inadequate loading speed. The developer needs to fix these defects to improve the user experience. Suppose there is a lag in site loading due to server delay. In that case, the coder needs to find suitable hosting for their website. In this way, the developer will enhance the user experience, product accessibility, and usability.</p><h2>7. Limited Resource</h2><p>In many startups or small businesses, there won't be any dedicated resource for design. Developers out there want to tackle projects entirely on their own, who can't afford to hire a designer (or require to spend the money elsewhere). They will be able to learn to design for their products until they identify the valuable resource.</p><p>Another main reason developers need to learn design is to work more effectively with designers. If the developer understands the basic design, it will help create stunning UI and create a better user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Learning about design improves the relationship between designer and developer. The developer can easily understand the user interface correction that is provided by the designer. Learning makes the developer view the design on the designer's view for the application development.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Designing in the Browser</h2><p>Many designers hesitate to perform designing on the browser because they need to know the necessary CSS and HTML programming or codes to create on the browser. That is the specific reason behind why it's an excellent fit for engineers getting into designing.</p><p>There are many tools and browser plugins available today, which assist you in designing the browser. Which makes the developer and designer's life easy. Here are some useful tools for coder and UI/UX designers includes Sketch, Axure, InVision Studio, Craft, Proto.io, Adobe XD, Webflow, Figma, and more&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</h2><p>Not all designers need to know to write coding in contrast to the front-end developer, which doesn't mean it is necessary to know UX. But both the UX design and Front end development work more excellently together. If a front-end developer has both, the knowledge will help in creating significant and usable applications. Learning will bridge the gap between the designer and developer and can complete the quality-assured application.</p><h2>10.&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</h2><p>The demand for programming engineers is developing by 22% consistently until 2029. Among all the developers with a special in user experiences are ahead of the job compilation. Users are the priority of any app or web app development, so many recruits look for candidates who have sound knowledge of software development, and UX design is considered more. As a developer, expand your career horizons by continuous learning. A basic understanding of UX design will increase the chance of landing your dream job.</p><h2>11. Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</h2><p>UX impacts client satisfaction; as a result, it will generate higher ROI for the longer term. It is essential to develop the best user experience at the first interaction with your product.&nbsp;</p><p>Best UX design will engage your user with your application and create customer loyalty for your brands. People will also recommend the product if they are satisfied. It will increase your inbound leads and revenue. If the coder doesn't understand, UX's fundamentals will create a negative impact on UI. Research says that companies that spend on UX design can increase a minimum of 30% sales.</p><h2>12.&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</h2><p>By learning new skills like UX, you will come out of your comfort zone. Many platforms provide free and paid online courses about user experience design. Here are some of the websites with lessons that help you to upgrade your expertise in designing.</p><p><strong>Coursera: </strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-design">Introduction to User Experience Design </a>&amp; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals">UX Design Fundamentals</a></p><p><strong>Learnux.io: </strong><a href="https://learnux.io/course/usability">Course on Usability</a></p><p><strong>UX Design Institute:</strong> <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/courses/ux-design?utm_source=uxstudio&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=top_10_courses">Professional Diploma in UX Design</a></p><p>You can find many similar online courses to grow your expertise in UI and UX design.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>13.

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>
<i>A parable on the Logical Postivist "interpretation" of scientific models.
<!-- Granted, I use the term "logical positivist" in a somewhat expanded but specific sense, -->
<!-- loosely the idea that "science is good models" or what was called in the past "instrumentalism." -->
</i>
</p>

<h2>The Parable</h2>

<p>
Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have eyes with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually happens on a chess board.
(The whites and blacks and squares all blur together.)
</p>

<p>
They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can sit two players (a so-called "white" and "black" player) down to play it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.
</p>

<p>
After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time, the white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins (we'll ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).
</p>

<h3>The "best" model</h3>

<p>
A logical positivist alien thus creates the ultimate, long-term model of chess as an iterated game:
Chess amounts to just a drawn-out coin flip.
Half of the time white wins, half of the time black wins, just as if they were tossing a quarter.
</p>

<p>
The aliens then decide to model chess as a coin flip, as a 50-50 game with no underlying principles.
While this statistical technique might not be useful for predicting a single game, over the long run and over iterated games, <em>it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model</em>.
</p>

<h3>"Inferior" models</h3>

<p>
Suppose, however that a "crank" scientist of the alien race posits that "God doesn't play dice" and that chess is a more complicated game, despite the fact that the aliens cannot observe it.
Suppose even he asks around and determines from humans that there are actually pieces on the board with functions, and he even devises a machine that allows his alien eyes to see the first move of the game of chess.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this move allows him to create a new theory and model of the game,
one that takes into account the first move made and he tries to generate a new set of probabilities of victory based on that move.
The model he makes, is of course highly arbitrary, stipulated and <em>ad hoc</em>.
In fact,
this model is inferior on many inevitable accounts.
For example:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is less predictive over iterated games than the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It is not as parsimonious/minimal as the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It adds new variables to the theory (pieces) that are suspect.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Which model is "right?"</h2>

<h3>Which model is closer to truth?</h3>

<p>
Since we, unlike the aliens, are not prevented by defect from observing chess, we know that the second, "inferior" theory of chess is truer.
Its theoretical categories, if apparently arbitrary in the eyes of the aliens, are getting at the actual underlying mechanics of chess.
Even if the model is less effective, it is certainly <em>righter</em>.
</p>

<h3>Which will cause fruitful scientific inquiry?</h3>

<p>
The coin flip model is a scientific dead-end.
Firstly, the coin flip model is constructed statistically, which presents the underlying mechanism to be randomness, and thus unworth of inquiry.
This isn't statistics hoisted above random variation we know to exist, instead, it's utterly blind statistics that covers over whatever principles underlie it.
</p>

<p>
Secondly and more importantly, in order to actually improve that model, it has to <em>lose</em> empirical solvency:
embracing the abstractions of pieces means introducing mess and
deviating in some way from the empircal generalization that half of all chess games are won by white and half by black.
</p>

<h3>This is not an abnormal circumstance.</h3>

<p>
The parable here, really an <em>example</em> is not abnormal.
In most affairs in science, whether that be physics or neuroscience or economics or chemistry, we are exactly like the partially-blind aliens.
</p>

<h3>"But science isn't about truth!"</h3>

<p>
Yeah, it is dude.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are pretending that science is about "models" or fitting equations and the like, again, the well-fit model is impossible to perfect, while the flawed, yet more true to reality model does have a potential over the long-term to be a superior one.
After exhaustive inquiry, an alien race might not only discover the pieces and the full set of rules behind chess, they might be able to predict what moves are good or bad and predict individual chess games.
Even on the standards of mere instrumentalism, the mindless positivistic theory is still actually inferior.
</p>

<h2>Local maxima</h2>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/pix/maximum.gif" alt="Local maximum">

<h3>The plot</h3>

<p>
One of the ways I visualize science and models is that each model is really like an n-dimensional optimization plot.
"Truth," or if you deny truth as metaphysics, "accuracy in data" or "well-fit equations" are upwards and the goal of science is to get further that way.
</p>

<p>
At the point you're at, you can tell which direction you can go to move upward, or, which little changes you can make to improve your model.
That is what incremental science is, after all: don't change assumptions and just fine-tune your equations.
The endless fine-tuning is sometimes thought of as "progress."
Of course I don't think that this is <em>bad</em>, but it is a very minor and scientifically less important part of science as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The reality of incremental science is that once you're at a local maximum, once you've fine-tuned your equations about as perfectly as possible,
it's over.
Everything next to you <em>looks</em> like a disimprovement.
It <em>looks</em> just like those inferior theories of alien chess that posit the existence of pieces.
From that, you might erroneously conclude that you have found the <em>global</em> maximum, which
due to the nature of the complexity of the universe and the multiplicity of
possible answers and theories, you flatly haven't.
</p>

<p>
Logical positivism is kind of theoretical lobotomy that implicitly tells scientists that they should never, ever, ever change foundational assumptions:
tweaking equations like an oblivious autist is Science®️ and everything else is "philosophy" or "metaphysics" or "pseudoscience."
This amounts to keeping each scientific field on whatever local maximum is closest, utterly unable to extricate themselves from it even when they see on the horizon abberant data.
<strong>If you want to understand the stagnation of science or any other specific field, this is where it comes from.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Purposefully "bad" science</h3>

<p>
In <i><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg">Against Method</a></i>, Paul Feyerabend, in what an unreflective mind might misinterpret as a "troll," says that it is important for science that people have biases, financial interests, interfering religious and political doctrines and the like in science.
Looking at the plot, you might now see why.
When we are stuck on a local maximum, every new data keeps our already-optimized model where it is no matter how low that maximum actually is.
What you need to shake it up is an external shock that totally moves our theoretical position somewhere new on the plot where we can try to optimize at another point, and then compare.
</p>

<h3>Basic assumptions</h3>

<p>
A prudent person should be able to question, "Am I even on the right track or am I playing with some model that has a fundamental flaw?"
I can guarantee you, optimizing for data and fitting math and equations is easy.
<strong>All theoretical programs are wrong because they make incorrect core assumptions.</strong>
This is very hard for the ego of scientists because it means:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.</li>
    <li>All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste of time.</li>
    <li>The borders of science are borders more of a sociological club than being the border of raw rigor.</li>
    <li>Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the theoretical framework that gave rise to it.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I guess this is the first blog post of the new year, even though I’m not someone who is keen on celebrating a new year, I sincerely hope every one would have a very bright 2021.</em></p>
<p>Most of you are enjoying unlimited internet at your homes, but sadly <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/">I’m coming from a part of the world that charges according to the data I use. </a></p>
<p>I basically pay for my data and I have monthly cap, and if I exceed that data limit I will have to buy an expensive data add-on. So data is something precious to me.</p>
<p>In the month of December, may be due to a technical error by the ISP my data add-on finished and I made a tweet criticizing them.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Scammed again by <a href="https://twitter.com/SriLankaTelecom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SriLankaTelecom</a> you should be ashamed of your practices </p><p>Bought a zoom package and data add-on today because I need zoom to work</p><p>But then suddenly by noon the internet got slower.

<p>The ISP was kind enough to reach out to me and I received an email detailing the data use of my internet connection.</p>

<p>One thing that immediately caught my eye was what’s at number 2, it was <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>There has been 17 connections to Pinterest and Pinterest has sent me more than 1.2GB of data.</strong></p>
<p>Even the 2000+ requests to Facebook has only downloaded roughly 300MB of data.</p>
<p>Why Pinterest is sending so much data in just 17 requests? What do they contain?</p>
<p>Maybe they are preloading or caching images for better user experience. But still 1.28GB of images is likely to have more than 1000 images.</p>
<p>Another explanation can that the ISP is trying to give me an explanation why my data vanished. But both explanations doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>Since data is valuable to me I will try to block requests to Pinterest, and see if that will make a difference to my data usage.</p>
<p>I’ll request another report at the end of the month to see my data usage for the month of January to compare before and after blocking Pinterest.</p>
<p>Has anyone had a similar experience in Pinterest or is it just me?</p>

		<p>Splitting headache at 10am. Not a fine way to start the day.</p>
<p>For the last 10+ years, I’ve consumed 2-5 cups of coffee every day. I was hooked to coffee is an understatement. It had gotten so bad that if I didn’t get coffee by 9am, I’d get a debilitating migraine for the rest of the day. I also had restless sleep, bordering on insomnia, where I wouldn’t sleep at all for a couple nights a month.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee"></p><figcaption>Sleep killer, headache giver, kick in the butt</figcaption>
</div>
<p>In February 2020, I got the worst flu in years (don’t think it was COVID). The first three days were extra painful with withdrawal headaches.
I decided a change was in order. My last coffee was January 31st, 2020.
The rest of the process was not predetermined. I tried to follow my body needs and didn’t push to quit with a definite date in mind.</p>
<p>After I recovered from the flu, I switched to black tea for the next several months.
I felt physically sluggish and mentally slower.</p>
<p>Black tea was followed by green tea for about two months. My sleep dramatically improved, however still felt lethargic. After green tea, I still didn’t feel ready to stop all together.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/tea.jpg" alt="Jasmine Pearl Tea"></p><figcaption>Savior, kinda</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Enter <u><a href="https://amzn.to/3pwj3Cc">jasmine pearl tea</a></u>. It’s rolled up into a ball and each ball has 1-3 tea leaves. I started using three tea balls for my morning tea. Over the course of three months, I’m down to <i>one tea ball every other day</i>. It’s been a useful tool for measuring caffeine intake. Final quitting day is February 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>The few things I’ve learned along the way:</p>
<h5 id="a-dont-plan-for-every-eventuality">A. Don’t plan for every eventuality</h5>
<p>It was tempting to outline every possible aspect of this challenge – what to drink, when to drink it, how often, when to decrease dosage, what to do in case of a backslide etc. I consciously avoided this for two reasons. One, making a full blown plan feels so satisfying that the actual challenge doesn’t feel compelling anymore, leading me to underperform or give up. And two, I might give up if I backslide so badly that my plan doesn’t account for it. That’s pretty demoralizing.</p>
<h5 id="b-celebrate-positive-consequences">B. Celebrate positive consequences</h5>
<p>I still have headaches if I miss my “caffeine window”. But they are far less painful and much more manageable. That’s a win! I sleep so much better now too.</p>
<h5 id="c-take-your-time">C. Take your time</h5>
<p>It took 10 years to get to this level of caffeine dependence. Spending one year to unwind this addiction is relatively fast! I felt a lot slower mentally in the first 6 months and still do as I continue to reduce my caffeine. I expect that once I no longer depend on caffeine, my body will pick up the slack.</p>
<p>All in all, This has been another step in discipline and a healthier me.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \big( \lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2 \big) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

</p><p>So using Gaussian integral, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - …</p></div></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A few years ago, while using the Line app, I noticed a feature called "People nearby." The feature lets you connect with other Line users within the same area. The feature would give you the exact distance from you to the other users. If someone spoofs their latitude, longitude, they can triangulate a user and find their location. I reported an issue in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://line.me/en/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Line app</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and They paid me $1000 for it. They fixed it by adding a random number to the user's destination. You can find my name&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bugbounty.linecorp.com/en/halloffame/2017/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">here</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></p><p>A few days ago, I installed Telegram, and I noticed that they have the same feature. I tried to see if I can unmask other users' locations, and I found they have the same issue I discovered in the Line app a few years ago. I reported the problem to Telegram security, and they said it's not an issue.&nbsp;<strong>If you enable the feature of making yourself visible on the map, you're publishing your home address online. </strong><span>Lot of users don't know this when they enable that feature. This is what they said when I emailed them:</span>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>From:<span>	</span>security@telegram.org</p><p>To: me</p><p>Hello,</p><p>Thanks for reaching us out. Users in the People Nearby section</p><p>intentionally share their location, and this feature is disabled by</p><p>default. It's expected that determining the exact location is possible</p><p>under certain conditions.</p><p>Unfortunately, this case is not covered by our bug bounty program.</p></blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Disclosure timeline:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Contacted Telegram on December 22nd with full details of how to exploit the information.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They responded on December 23rd; they asked me to create a video of the PoC 🙄</span></li></ul><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I made a video on the same day and sent it to them.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">They responded after 14 days, saying their bug bounty program does not cover the issue.</span></li></ul><p><span>So, here is how it works in detail:<br></span><span>Open Telegram, and go to people near me, there is an option to see how far people are from your location.</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-53f1000f-7fff-b4b2-905d-ee47865be904"><span><span><img height="351" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JbKyjueKloPEbmeyE9ZbcVkATBhRNlY4hjl8NZZOhHn4lgt56UnjR3HjAVP2Z5MNSAAe0jzL3rKNjfLI3QCueXXe6inocEKB5RwX9b6A3kIydvA74fjzmfZlEjkH0bNrfQUYR80I" width="268"></span></span></span></p><div><p>After you click on it, it will show a list of people near you like the following:</p></div><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-684e7a7b-7fff-37c6-a5fc-5d6693280cf8"><span><span><img height="478" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/umUhHMfl3qKMXVgyIdX3pXnKuronNR29XQgzc_WoX0imTtVPTvEWBLhK5x-WZvu3vz-KEInZy5lZGIOLdSO0DUP33G3Iv-758309YimhtEMxU1xM63QKoGeTJq473VIGLT0N78Yh" width="276"></span></span></span></p><p>If you notice, Telegram is telling me how far each person is far from me.

If you’re dealing with an unruly firmware project, treat yourself to some relief and check out what this can do for your project.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579902767344_16174"><div><h2><strong>The Foe</strong></h2><p><strong>Bluetooth Low Energy firmware</strong> applications have their <strong>inherent complexities</strong>. They’re structured as <strong>event-driven systems. </strong>That basically mean they react to “events” that can occur at any time.  That’s physical event sources like button presses, battery alerts, and sensors inputs, but also to incoming Bluetooth communications from an App. In our experience, even top-tier chip vendors like Nordic Semiconductors provide subpar guidance on how to best orchestrate this system of events and reactions. An unsuspecting developer may feel they’re using a lean approach, linking event sources in code to their corresponding reactions in a piecemeal fashion. The complexity of this patch network soon grows exponentially and starts feeling like a firmware savant is required just to make sense of it all.   As the project grows, the <strong>event-reaction mappings grow in quantity </strong>and<strong> </strong>likely require being dynamically re-mapped in different modes of operation. If left untreated, the affliction can get the best of you, spreading faster than you add features. If you’re anything like us, there’s an inevitable face-the-music moment where this event-driven <strong>spaghetti code </strong>can no longer be tolerated. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579741448937_7867"><div>

It’s the kind that<em> </em>compiles into bytes and bites to deal with. If you’re not aware of spaghetti code and its nauseating effects, then let’s briefly recap.  “Spaghetti code” is a slang term for code with convoluted structure, so much that it’s difficult to debug and and maintain it.</p><p><strong>What problems are caused by event-driven spaghetti code?</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Bugs: the worst kind of bugs.</strong> It’s the ugly should-have-been-avoidable bugs that crop up and continue to crop up when you lose a handle on the structure of your application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code duplication.</strong> The completely unnecessary there-must-be-a-better-way kind of duplication. When the system for handling events is poorly structured, developers struggle to repurpose code across similar events and states of operation. For example, a “battery charging” and “charge complete” state should be able to elegantly share a lot of charging-related functionality. </p></li><li><p> <strong>Loneliness</strong>, also known as staffing problems due to your unmaintainable codebase.<strong> </strong> No one likes to work alone, so restructure your application in a way that your coworkers and future coworkers cherish. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_6416"><div><h2><strong>Fret Not</strong></h2><p>I want to recommend a system that’s worked for me — two steps for developers like us to immunize against the spaghetti affliction right from the start. </p><p><strong>Overview of the Steps to Avoid Spaghetti Code:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Use an atomic <strong>event queue</strong>. Rather than reacting to events all over your different interrupt execution contexts, an event queue allows you to consolidate those portions of your code into one place. It’s your conduit for “deferring” the handling of events from many contexts (like interrupts) into one main context. It additionally solves the issue of thread/interrupt safety, by avoiding concurrent access of shared resources across different contexts..  For example, you don’t want a SPI peripheral used in two contexts that can interrupt one another. Instead, both contexts can queue events for the main function to perform the SPI operations sequentially. </p></li><li><p>Use a <strong>hierarchical state machine (HSM)</strong>, and a framework to implement one. An HSM is the  knockout punch for our spaghetti foe. It provides an intuitive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic</a> scheme to define how events should be handled throughout various modes of operation. HSMs are “hierarchical” in the sense that each state can be configured to inherit behaviors from a “superstate”, a more general state that encapsulates it and potentially other states. The hierarchical aspect of HSMs make them far more practical for real-world firmware applications than a textbook flat state machine. A “battery charging” and “charging complete” state could both inherit and share a bulk of their code from an “charger attached” state. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_14942"><div><h2><strong>Immunization Step 1 of 2: <br>Take a queue from your vendor</strong></h2><p><strong>An event queue is the essence of event-driven architecture</strong>. If you’re already using one and understand their merit, you may want to jump ahead to the next part.</p><p>Firmware events generally arrive in the context of an interrupt, either hardware or software driven. In the case of some dead-simple events, you might get away handling them right there in the interrupt; But, generally that’s bad practice. There’s a common <strong>embedded development commandment</strong>:</p><p><strong><em> “Thou shalt not dilly dally within an interrupt service routine”</em></strong></p><p>And lest we forget its companion rule:</p><p><strong><em>“Respect thine interrupt/thread safety”</em></strong></p><p>Immunization step #1 is using the atomic queue to <span>defer event processing to one location in your main context</span>. That keeps us complaint with the embedded commandments, and sets the groundwork for the step #2.</p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="54.93333333333334" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579946663094_24662"><div>

Right off the bat, that gains you cozy-warm assurances of thread/interrupt safety because event handling isn’t strewn across all sorts of overlapping execution contexts.</p><p>Courteous silicon vendors usually provide developers with some form of an atomic queue. <strong>Nordic </strong>provides <strong>nRF52</strong> developers with <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/sdk_nrf5_v16.0.0/lib_scheduler.html?cp=7_1_3_39">their “app scheduler”</a><em>. </em><strong>Texas Instruments</strong><em> </em>provides <strong>CC2640</strong> developers with <a href="http://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_2_40_00_32/docs/blestack/ble_user_guide/html/ble-stack-tirtos/queues.html">their queue module</a> accompanying their TI-RTOS. For our intents and purposes, both of these modules are just different packagings of a functionally-equivalent queue. </p><p>Here’s a snippet of generic example code to drive the concept home:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579734449814_4508"><div><pre><code>// eventHandler is always executed in the "main" context

    switch(event){
        case TIMER_FIRED:
            perform_periodic_task();
            start_timer();
            break;
        case BUTTON_PRESS:
            react_to_button_press();
            break;
        case BUTTON_RELEASE:
            react_to_button_release();
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}

// Interupt handlers
void timerFired_interrupt(void){
    // Add event to the event queue
    // deferring its handling to the main context
    queue_push(TIMER_FIRED);
}

void buttonPress_interrupt(void){
    queue_push(BUTTON_PRESS);
}

void buttonRelease_interrupt(void){
    queue_push(BUTTON_RELEASE);
}

int main(void){
    // Initialize and configure button interrupt
    initialize_buttons();
    initialize_timer();
    start_timer();

    // Main loop    
    for (;;)
    {
        // idle() stays in a low-power state until there's an event
        idle(); 
        while( !queue_empty() ){
            Event event = queue_dequeue();
            eventHandler(event);
        }

    <p><strong>Monday, January  4, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>If you're building an application that needs to scale—and we all tell ourselves that we are—then at some point you have to figure out if it <em>does</em> or not. This is where load testing comes in: if you want to see whether or not your application can handle scale, just <em>generate</em> scale and see if it can handle it! It sounds straightforward enough.</p>
<p>Then you try to actually generate load. This is straightforward if your application is dead simple, because you can use something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JMeter">Apache JMeter</a> to generate repeated requests. If you can do this, I envy you: every system I've worked on is more complicated and requires a more intricate testing plan.</p>
<p>Your application gets slightly more complicated, so you then turn to tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)">Gatling</a>. These let you simulate virtual users going through scenarios, which is a lot more helpful than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_(software)">besieging</a>&nbsp;one or a handful of URLs. Even this isn't sufficient if you're writing an application that uses both WebSockets <em>and</em> HTTP calls, over a long-lived session, and requires certain actions repeated on a timer. Unless I severely missed something in the documentation, I cannot see a way to, say, setup a heartbeat that runs ever 30 seconds, do certain actions upon response to a WebSocket message, and also do some other HTTP actions, all with the same HTTP session. I haven't found a way to do that in <em>any</em> load testing tool (which is why I wrote my own at work, which I hope to open source if I can make the time to clean it up and separate out proprietary bits).</p>
<p>But let's suppose you <em>do</em> have a tool that works, out of the box, like Gatling or Locust, and it fits your needs. Great! Now let's write that test. In my experience, this is the hardest bit yet, because you have to first figure out what realistic load looks like — welcome to a day or three of dredging through logs and taking notes while you peer at the network tools in your browser as you click around in your web application. And then after you know what realistic load looks like, you get to write what boils down to a subset of your application to pretend to be a user, hit the API, and do the things your user would do.</p>
<p>And we're not done yet! This is fine, we have our load test written and it's realistic. But this is a moving target, because updates keep going out. So now you have the maintenance problem, too: as your application changes, how do you keep your load test up to date? There isn't great tooling to do this, there is little out there to help you. You have to make this part of your process and hope you don't miss things. This is not a satisfying answer, and that's why this is also one of the hardest parts of load testing an application.</p>
<p>We'll just skip the whole "running it" part, because honestly, if you've gotten this far through a load test, then running it shouldn't be the hardest part.</p>

<p>So basically, here's where we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most load testing tools support simplistic workloads, and even the complex ones don't let you do everything that's realistically needed to simulate <em>real</em> usage of a web application.</li>
<li>Writing the test with a simulation of real usage is the hardest part, even if the tools do support what you need.</li>
<li>Maintaining the test is the second hardest part, and the tooling here does not help you in the slightest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at these in detail and see how much complexity we can pare away.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-users-do-we-have-to">Simulating users. Do we have to?</h2>
<p>I'm a "yes" here, although it might depend on your application. And for these purposes, we're talking about the user <em>of a service</em>; if you have a monolith, this is your users as a whole, but if you have microservices the "user" might be another one of your services! For the applications I've worked on, I have had minor success with targeted tests of specific endpoints. But these end up requiring such complicated setup that you aren't better off than you were with the load test itself! And while it may yield some results and improvements, it doesn't get to everything (you may have endpoints that interact) and you don't get a realistic workload.</p>
<p>"When do you <em>not</em> need to simulate users?" is probably a better question. Seems to me like this is when you <em>know</em> that your endpoints are all independent in performance, you don't have any stateful requests, and the ordering of requests does not impact performance. These are big things to assume and it's hard to have confidence in them without testing their independence, at which point, we're back to writing that whole dang test.</p>
<p>The best you can do here is probably at the API and system design time, not at your test time. If you design a simpler API, you're going to have far less surface area to test. If you design a system with more certainly independent pieces (distinct databases per service, for example) then it's easier to test them in isolation than in a monolith. Doing this also lets you use a tool that is simpler, so you get two wins!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-tests-is-hard-so-is-maintenance">Writing the tests is <em>hard.</em> So is maintenance.</h2>
<p>Creating a load test is hard because you have to do a few things: you have to understand what the flow through <em>usage</em> of your API is, and you have to write a simulation of that usage. Understanding that flow means understanding other systems than the one under test and since your system is presumably not the focus of their documentation, there is not going to be a super clear diagram of when and how it's called; this often looks like sifting logs until you figure out what the representative usage is. And then writing that simulation is certainly not trivial, because you need to manage the state for a large number of actors representing users of your API!</p>
<p>Oh, and you get to write integration tests for this now, too.</p>
<p>There's some research out there on how to make some of these tasks easier. You can figure out what you need for the initial test, and detect regressions (missing new workloads) from automated analysis of the logs, for example. But as far as I can tell, there is no software on GitHub, let alone a product I can buy, that's going to do that for me. So it doesn't seem like it has much of any traction in industry. It would be a big project to implement it on your own, which might be why it has languished (or is done at big companies, and is not spoken of).</p>

<p>There's a lot of complexity in load tests, and there is not a lot of tooling to help you with it. So maybe the answer is: write fewer of these types of tests, and don't expect them to give you all the answers to how your system performs.</p>
<p>You have a few options for getting a great picture of how your system performs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good old analysis.</strong> Sit down with a notebook, a pen, an understanding of your systems as a whole, and an afternoon to spare, and you can figure out with some napkin math what the general parameters and bounds of scaling on your system are. When you find the bottleneck, or you have some unknowns (how many transactions per second <em>can</em> our database support? how many do we generate?) then you can go test those specifically!</li>
<li><strong>Feature rollouts.</strong> If you can roll out features slowly across your users, then you don't necessarily have to do any load testing at all! You can measure performance experimentally and see if it's good enough. Good? Roll forward. Bad? Roll back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic replay.</strong> This doesn't help at all with new features (see feature rollouts ten words ago for that) but it does help with understanding your system breaking points for existing features without as much development. You can take the traffic you saw before and replay it (multiple times over, even, by combining multiple different periods' traffic) and see how the system performs! (Side note: I would <em>love</em> tooling to help with this, and with amplifying traffic when doing this, so if anyone has a recommendation... hit me up.)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you have some silver bullet I've missed, or a fantastic research paper in this area you'd recommend reading, or a story of terrible times with scaling that you want to share with me, please email them to <a href="mailto:me@ntietz.com">me@ntietz.com</a>.</p>

The delivery driver who brought his groceries from Vons mentioned that drivers across the state are getting fired by Vons, Pavilions, and other California stores owned by Albertsons Companies in late February. Stores will instead turn to a third-party delivery service using independent contractors.</p><p id="d033">â€œI was disturbed and disappointed that Vons would eliminate these jobs. I felt like they were the only remaining company that treated delivery drivers ethically but no longer,â€� said Dylan.</p><p id="1f42">After publication, an Albertsons representative sent the following statement: â€œWe will transition that portion of our eCommerce operations to third-party logistics providers.â€� She added â€œWhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasnâ€™t a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration.â€�</p><p id="10d5">Drivers under the Albertsons Companies umbrella are employees, while Ralphs delivery is operated by Instacart and Target uses Shipt, a similar app. At Bay Area stores, drivers are unionized, and will not be affected by the layoffs. For southern California shoppers, this move leaves them without a grocery delivery option that treats drivers as employees.</p><p id="baaa">Unions are vowing to fight the change, says Jim Araby, Director of Strategic Campaigns at UCFW5. â€œThe only drivers that kept their jobs were the unionized drivers in the Bay Area. All the other drivers in California were laid off because they were non-union. We represent those drivers and they will keep their job.â€�</p><p id="4b12">These layoffs are unsurprising after the passage of Proposition 22, which gutted worker protections while making it easier for companies to shift financial burdens onto newly-designated â€œindependent contractors.â€� In a <a rel="noopener" href="https://knock-la.com/the-case-for-voting-no-on-ca-prop-22-a64d25b2828d">piece for KNOCK</a> last year, Keith F. Eberl predicted this exact outcome in the opening paragraph:</p><blockquote><p id="95b6">â€œContrary to the companiesâ€™ deceptive ad campaign and intimidating messages to their workers, Prop 22 does not preserve driver flexibility or save drivers from politicians. What Prop 22 does do is change current law so the companies can shift their costs to the driver and diminish or remove driversâ€™ rights, protections, and benefits. Prop 22 will also block driversâ€™ ability to organize so they canâ€™t collectively bargain a contract. In addition, this proposition will block local governments from writing or enforcing protections for drivers.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="a03f">The only surprise is the speed at which Albertsons reversed course on its commitments to workers. This move comes after nearly a year of celebrating grocery store workers for feeding communities. <a href="https://www.vons.com/steps-we-are-taking-at-your-grocery-store.html" rel="noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Albertsons Companies President &amp; CEO Vivek Sankaran said the company was â€œtaking care of our team.â€� Albertsons Companies â€œare workingâ€¦ to ensure that every member of our team who faces a crisis can have peace of mind that we will help them get through it.â€�</p><p id="c5d5">Albertsons was happy to reap public goodwill during the pandemic. But once Prop 22 gave the company the option of replacing workers with lower-paid contractors, they jumped at the opportunity. Employees received notice during the holidays that their employment would end one month into the new year.</p><p id="66cc">Early in the pandemic, union members demanded hazard pay, additional medical leave, and employee protections during the pandemic. In March, Safeway and Northern California grocery workers <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Coronavirus-Safeway-reaches-new-agreement-for-15150811.php" rel="noopener">reached an agreement</a> providing these additional benefits.</p><p id="452b">Labor and management were able to cooperate in April, requesting that grocery workers be designated as first responders. In an April j<a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/helping-you-through-covid-19/albertsons-companies-ucfw-launch-joint-effort.html" rel="noopener">oint statement</a>, Sankaran and United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) President Marc Perrone wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="c86a">â€œThis joint action is an example of how all Americans must work together to protect everyone working on the frontlines. This includesâ€¦ associates at our nationâ€™s grocery stores who are providing communities with the essential food and supplies needed to weather this public health crisis.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="0a33">Negotiations in October <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">turned contentious</a>, as members of the Teamsters issued a notice of potential strike due to rising healthcare costs. Lou Villavazo, who chairs the bargaining effort, told the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">Orange County Register</a> that â€œemployers have been bargaining in bad faith. Weâ€™ve had over 18 bargaining sessions with them and we provided our economic proposal â€¦ but no response.â€�</p><p id="e2db">Organized labor made the difference for drivers in the Bay Area, who will remain as employees for now. But without the power of a union, southern California drivers lack an organizational structure through which to fight back.</p><p id="b343">Many, myself included, turned to Vons and Albertsons stores for their groceries, knowing that drivers were employed with benefits. Unionized drivers offered a clear alternative to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/no-holiday-cheer-for-gig-workers-hunting-your-last-minute-gifts" rel="noopener">hellscape of gig-economy apps</a> like Instacart.</p><p id="a579">In a <a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/newsroom/appreciation-pay-for-front-line-associates.html" rel="noopener">March 2020 statement</a>, Sankaran said â€œthese times are unprecedented in the grocery industryâ€¦ [a] simple â€˜thank youâ€™ doesnâ€™t seem like quite enough.â€� He was right. Delivery drivers deserve healthcare, job protections, and fair wages. Workers won those fights this year because they fought as a union. With DoorDash taking over in February, that united front will be gone.</p><p id="26c2">You can contact Albertsons Companies and let them know what you think of this move:</p><p id="2910">Vons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2f7e">Albertsons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2b59"><em>EDITORâ€™S NOTE: After publication, Albertsonâ€™s responded to KNOCKâ€™s request for comment. This piece has since been edited to clarify that union drivers will not be laid off and that workers facing layoffs in Southern California are non-union, as well as to include statements from both Albertsons and UCFW5. The scheduled date of the layoffs was also corrected.</em></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

It's a total wipeout after two years of building a business that's also my full-time focus and my family's sole source of income. I'm heartbroken and confused.</p><h2><strong>The Cruelest Year</strong></h2><p>2020 has been awful, and despite this new challenge that I face, I still count myself blessed. A friend of mine has lived in a veritable shoebox for a decade, pumping every hour and cent he had into building two of the most beloved bars in New York City. He filed for bankruptcy last month. Another friend attended a family reunion in February; it was the last time that she'd see several of her relatives (who died from COVID-19 in the weeks that followed).</p><p>Again, no matter what happens to this site, I really do feel fortunate and blessed.</p><h2><strong>The Risk of Relying on Big Tech</strong></h2><p>As much as I've tried to diversify <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em>'<em>s</em> revenue and traffic, I haven’t escaped the gravitational pull of Amazon and Google. This poses major risks and I advise caution to anyone considering a similar business model.</p><p>In April of this year, Amazon <a href="https://searchengineland.com/amazon-affiliate-commission-rates-cut-332966">reduced the affiliate commissions</a> that it pays to online publishers. My revenue fell by 41% as a result. It was a crushing blow that I attempted to mitigate by joining other affiliate programs, but they didn't pan out. The median conversion rate of the 70 other websites that I linked to was a meager 0.8%, which is approximately 1/10 of the conversion rate on Amazon.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607784280213_34634"><div>

These media mentions drove hundreds of thousands of visits. Nevertheless, if someone who was referred to this website two years ago is looking for a cheap portable generator today, he or she is much more likely to Google "cheap portable generator" than to come to my homepage.</p><p>It's understandable. Alas, without search visibility, this site in invisible.</p><h2><strong>Can a Domain Be Cursed?</strong></h2><p>I did my due diligence before I registered goodcheapandfast.com. It had no backlink history and it had only existed previously as a parked domain in 2013. There are no obvious skeletons in this domain's closet, yet strange things have been afoot, almost since day one.</p><p>For example, Bing didn't even index this website's homepage a month after <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was linked to from websites like Esquire and Slate. I contacted bingwb@microsoft.com with my concerns and received this response:</p><blockquote><p>Good day and thank you for your patience while we investigated the issue.</p><p>Firstly, I am happy to provide you information that our product review group succeeded in removing the block of the site. After submitting your site to be reviewed the team has decided to lift the  block. Please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your site to be crawled indexed and serving again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am unable to provide you the specifics of the block as our product review team does not share details of the block.</p></blockquote><p>The mystery didn't end there. Two years later, this website has received fewer than 100 total referrals from Bing. That's not normal and neither is this: Since 2019, pages on this website started dropping in-and-out of Google's results. An article that ranked #1 would disappear entirely, then reappear, then disappear, then reappear. These were like mini strokes. Sometimes the traffic bounced back in full; other times it gradually faded away.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607704925648_28921"><div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>In a cruel twist, 2020 left parting gifts: at least two new, seemingly more dangerous variants of Covid-19. B.1.1.7 was <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>first identified</span></a> in the UK in September and has recently accounted for more than half of new cases in the country. B.1.351 is the variant behind a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-variant-in-south-africa-sparks-fear-of-faster-spread-possible-reinfection-11609358056"><span>new surge</span></a> in cases in South Africa. Both show signs of being significantly more transmissible than non-variant Covid-19, and B.1.1.7 has already been identified in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>dozens of countries</span></a> around the world, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz4z7/what-is-new-covid-strain-colorado-california"><span>including the U.S.</span></a> While scientists are relatively certain neither is more deadly, higher transmissibility could spell big trouble.</p>

<p>This week, The Factual looked at 24 articles from 21 sources to clarify just how potentially dangerous these new Covid variants are.</p>

<h4><strong>What We Think We Know</strong></h4>
<p>The importance of clarity and consistency in messaging was made clear early on in the pandemic, and many articles about these new variants seem to be forthright about the details of these new strains without engaging in fear-mongering or clickbait headlines. Here’s what we know reasonably well.</p>
<p><strong>Transmissibility: </strong>Both strains seem to demonstrate a greater level of transmissibility, meaning they spread easier from person to person. While the science is still being checked and triple-checked, the B.1.1.7 variant seems to be as much as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/health/coronavirus-uk-variant.html"><span>70% more transmissible</span></a> than the non-variant Covid-19. Less is known about B.1.351, but it seems<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/12/24/heres-where-3-new-strains-of-covid-19-have-traveled-so-far/?sh=368ac3f75139"><span> at least as dangerous</span></a> as B.1.1.7.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This increased transmissibility is a result of the routine genetic mutation that viruses (and, indeed, all lifeforms) undergo during replication or reproduction. For both strains, mutations to the spike protein — the protein that allows the virus to attach to uninfected cells — seem to make the virus <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know"><span>better at infecting</span></a> human cells. Additionally, early evidence also seems to suggest that the new variants result in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>higher viral loads</span></a>, meaning infected individuals are carrying more of the virus.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2C1MEGbbaNTm4tK1WK-uCnlCoE_IX2YId2Q_nDJPQBbdxLEkB9rIPuhZ9tkpb1SZuaJOfGTm7QT9NMtXULNV_9CNP53ghCgjWZyCOFzyH7ZXwcKqRhLjcmY0x4vtKqnfD3mI8sd9" width="624" height="560"></p>

<p><strong>Deadliness: </strong>A clear further risk with new mutations of a virus is that they could become more deadly for those who are infected. Thankfully, for these new Covid-19 variants the increase in transmissibility <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>does not appear</span></a> to be accompanied by an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>increase in the severity</span></a> of the disease.</p>
<p>However, the virus itself doesn’t need to cause more severe effects to still result in an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>increase in deaths</span></a>. For example, if the virus is much more transmissible, that can result in an exponential rise in cases and an inability to provide life-saving care to the cases that are severe. With hospitals around the U.S. already reaching maximum capacity, and non-Covid patients being <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-29/l-a-county-hospitals-at-the-breaking-point-turn-away-ambulances"><span>turned away</span></a>, an exponential increase in cases could very well lead to more Covid-related and non-Covid-related deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Scientists are very clear that the nature of the threat from the virus <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/first-us-case-of-uk-sars-cov-2-variant-detected-68312"><span>has not fundamentally changed</span></a> in terms of how the virus spreads and what we can do to stop its spread. The virus is still a respiratory illness that spreads through the air and close contact with other people. This means that the mitigation strategies already in place still apply and, if anything, are more important than ever.</p>
<p>Countries are responding by enacting more stringent applications of measures that were largely already in place. In London and the southeastern UK, where B.1.1.7 really came to the fore, a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>stringent lockdown</span></a> has been enacted to halt the spread of the virus, reversing a decision to loosen restrictions for the holidays. South Africa has enacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus-surge/2020/12/28/b4c8e17a-492c-11eb-97b6-4eb9f72ff46b_story.html"><span>strong measures</span></a> as well, including banning public gatherings and the sale of alcohol and making mask wearing in public mandatory. Abroad, many countries have halted flights from the UK and South Africa, reflecting that the danger for contagion is just too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Testing: </strong>A plausible risk is that the virus might mutate in such a way that leads positive cases to avoid identification, thereby necessitating new tests. Luckily, the mutations that the virus underwent <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>did not interfere</span></a> with our ability to identify positive cases with current testing technology. Though, for example, the virus did modify the spike protein that current tests look for—also known as the S gene—tests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"><span>look for a number of signals</span></a>, not just one. Scientists are now working to estimate the prevalence of B.1.1.7&nbsp; based on the number of positive tests without the S gene, cases known as S-gene dropouts.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p><strong>Vaccines: </strong>Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s minds is whether the stream of newly-approved vaccines will retain effecitveness against these new variants. While testing is still underway, there is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no evidence</span></a> to suggest that the vaccines will see any significant change in efficacy. Mutations are typically subtle and are unlikely to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>drastically alter</span></a> the biology of the virus in a short period of time, and the vaccines are designed to attack the virus from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>several angles</span></a>, meaning that the “broad immune response…that targets several areas of the spike protein” will continue to work.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4>The Big "Ifs"</h4>
<p>Much of what we know about the variants, beyond the likely increase in transmissibility, is none too alarming on the surface. However, there are some factors that we aren’t totally sure of just yet that could create big problems.</p>
<p><strong>Spread:</strong> These new variants show yet another way pandemic response has fallen short. Understanding the genetic variations in the virus requires routine genetic sequencing to identify new strains, but very few countries have been investing the resources to do so. While the UK invested early on to sequence cases to track the genetic variations, a CDC strain surveillance team in the U.S. was set up <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/31/with-limited-surveillance-of-covid-19-variant-its-deja-vu-all-over-again/"><span>only in November</span></a>, and the CDC had only sequenced 51,000 samples by the end of 2020, out of nearly 20 million cases. This not only means that we have no idea how widespread the B.1.1.7 variant is in the U.S., it means that we may have our own distinct variants <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>without even knowing</span></a>.</p>
<p>From the paltry amount of genetic sequencing that we do undertake in the U.S., we know for sure that B.1.1.7 is in California, Florida, and Colorado, but the circumstances of those cases is worrying. All three instances involve <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no significant travel history</span></a>, meaning that the variant is already in the U.S. and spreading via community transmission. The optimistic interpretation of this is that there may be a few, isolated pockets of this variant in the U.S. The pessimistic view, however, is that the U.S. is on the cusp, and well past the point of return, of a fast-moving outbreak that will dwarf what we’ve seen so far, absent strong response measures. The UK saw the B.1.1.7 variant appear in September but account for more than <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/new-covid-strain-in-us/"><span>60% of cases</span></a> in London just months later, accompanied by the worst outbreak yet. The same could be underway in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Susceptibility: </strong>One of the reprieves of Covid-19 has been that children are relatively less susceptible to infection. This has enabled some schooling to proceed under modified protocols, even while workplaces have been shut and public gatherings disbanded. However, the emergence of the new variants has corresponded with increases in rates of infection and severe cases among <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>children and young adults</span></a>. While some of this can likely be explained by schools remaining open and young people being likely to disregard social distancing guidance, for example, this doesn’t seem to be the whole story. Scientific testing continues, but many worry that the B.1.1.7 variant can actually <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-mutant-children-infection-neil-ferguson-b1777211.html"><span>more easily infect</span></a> young people than non-variant Covid-19, which may mean some previously effective Covid mitigation strategies will need to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/30/new-covid-strain-schools/"><span>reconsidered</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Risk:</strong> Some have pointed out that a significantly more transmissible virus is actually much <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>more worrisome</span></a> than a virus that just leads to more severe cases. In the latter instance, the virus still only affects the same number of people, though it kills more of them, but with the former, many, many times more people <a href="https://reason.com/2020/12/28/the-more-transmissible-u-k-covid-19-variant-could-make-the-pandemic-a-lot-worse/"><span>may become infected</span></a>—and potentially die.</p>
<p>“Kucharski compares a 50 percent increase in virus lethality to a 50 percent increase in virus transmissibility. Take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections—a plausible scenario for many European cities, as Kucharski notes. As things stand, with those numbers, we’d expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month—assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.” - Zeynep Tufekci, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>The Atlantic</span></a></p>
<p>But the risks don’t end there. The problem with an exponential increase in the number of cases, and indeed with the idea of letting the virus run its course through a population in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, is that this creates that many new opportunities for the virus to mutate further. This could lead to further changes in transmissibility, new variants that allow for reinfection, a more deadly combination of both transmissibility and severity, or even variants that, at some point, entirely undermine our vaccine efforts.</p>
<div><p>Any such change could have big positive or negative ramifications for the trajectory of the virus. Epidemics like H1N1 and various strains of Ebola proved to be too deadly to be truly disastrous on a global scale: they tended to kill their carriers at a rate that limits the ability of the virus to spread to new hosts. But those viruses may have been just a mutation away from a much more dangerous, if less lethal, form. Covid-19 may also be just a few mutations away from such a seismic shift, for better or for worse. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>Such mutations</span></a> are a “once-in-a-million event,” but “but one-in-a-million events may become a lot more common when you have a million new cases every four days, as the U.S. now does.”</p></div>

    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

Widely utilized services like Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, Autoscaling, Athena and others were affected.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Our beloved products from Adobe, Roku, Spotify, and Flickr went down together with AWS. Our hearts go out to these companies and their users.</p>
<p>"So many services being impacted simultaneously may be indicative of a large software rollout, or potentially localized underlying hardware or network issues,” said Leon Kuperman, CTO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “If it’s a software issue, it’s unusual that AWS would have chosen US-East as a canary region. US-East (Virginia) represents the largest AWS region and largest customer footprint, which would put it near last, if not last on the rollout schedule."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public-clouds are a godsend for tech companies. Migration to cloud allows startups and enterprises to skip over unnecessary investments in on-premise data centers and focus on what matters the most: develop products that people love, scale fast, and always be accessible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, public cloud providers like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform are eager to lock in companies to use their services exclusively. When you rely on one vendor, you go down when that vendor fails.</p>
<p>Today, AWS showed the true cost of putting all your eggs in one basket. It amplified the need for companies to have a multi-cloud disaster recovery and fail-over strategy. This strategy would still allow for a possibility of some cloud providers to go down, but it would also ensure that a cloud going down would not mean downtime for your users.</p>
<p>“A cloud failure should not become a disaster. Never again.” said Laurent Gil, CPO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “You can rest easy knowing that your infrastructure is never down.”</p>
<div><p>Imagine that you show up to your office one day and your office building is gone. That’s what happens when cloud providers like AWS go down. All you are left with is the question “Why?“. With CAST AI you don’t need to wonder.

<p>These days, in the covid world we live in we have multiple videoconferences every day, with colleagues, family, friends… The average number of people attending has grown, and when I was in a call some time ago, I wondered, what would be the “optimal” way of splitting the videconference application window among the people in the call? What would be the definition of “optimal”? And, in how many ways could the space be split?, as sometimes you might prefer, for instance, one where space is shared equally or one where the current speaker has predominance.</p>



<p>This intrigued me, and I started some research to try to find answers to these questions. I started with the assumption that the videoconference application owns a window on the screen, which is a rectangle (we will call it the bounding rectangle), and we want to divide it in \(N\) different rectangles, being \(N\) the number of people in the call. We can define different criteria for optimizing like, say, dividing equally the window area among the callers. However, for that we need to define mathematically the dividing rectangles, and here is where the first difficulty arises, as the mathematical description changes depending on how you split the window. For instance, two of the ways of dividing the bounding rectangle (let’s call that “rectangulation”) for \(N=3\) are as displayed:</p>



<div><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/N3.svg" alt="" width="755" height="355"><figcaption>Figure 1 – two possible ways of dividing a rectangle in three</figcaption></figure>




</div></div>



<p>Here we assign a width and a height to each rectangle. Note that optimizing means assigning values to these \(w_i\) and \(h_i\) to fulfill the optimizations criteria, which is like moving the “walls” between rectangles. The height \(h\) and width \(w\) of the bounding rectangle are considered fixed. In each rectangulation, it is possible to expose the implicit restrictions by equations that relate widths and heights of the different rectangles. For the first one in the image, the equations are:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_1 &amp; = &amp; w_3 \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br> \end{array}$$</p>



<p>For the second one:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br>h_2 &amp; = &amp; h_3<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>When we optimize we need to take into account these restrictions, which implies that for each rectangulation we have a different optimization problem with different solutions due to having different restrictions/equations in each case. The conclusion is that we need to solve the optimization problem for all possible rectangulations for a given \(N\), and then compare the different optimal values to select the best one. In summary, the steps we need to follow are</p>



<ol><li>Find all possible rectangulations for \(N\) callers</li><li>Decide an optimization criteria</li><li>Solve the optimization problem for all rectangulations, finding the best sizes for each way of splitting the bounding rectangle</li><li> Choose the best rectangulation by finding out which of them has the optimal solution that fulfills better the optimization criteria</li></ol>



<p>In the following sections we will go through each of these steps. I have developed some python code that implements the algorithms and that includes some unit tests that drive them and will be mentioned in different parts of the article. You can find it in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" target="_blank">github</a>. If on an Ubuntu system, you can install dependencies and clone the repository from the command line with:</p>



<p><code>$ sudo apt install python3-pip</code><br><code>$ pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy</code><br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations</code></p>



<p>N.B. In the mathematical expressions we use one-based indexes but, for practical reasons, the code uses zero-based indexes.</p>



<h2>Rectangulating a rectangle</h2>



<p>There is quite a bit of mathematical literature on the topic of rectangulations, motivated by applications like placing elements in integrated circuits. Depending on how you define them there can be more or less ways to “rectangulate” a rectangle. We want to take into account all possible rectangulations, but at the same time we need to be careful to avoid duplications. In our framework, a single rectangulation is one that can represent all rectangle sets that can fulfill a given set of equations as those shown at the beginning. Practically, that means that we can slide segments in the rectangulation (without changing the vertical or horizontal orientation) along the limiting segments, as that will not change the relationship that the equations describe. Each of these rectangulations is a class of equivalence of all possible rectangle sets described by a set of equations, and we need to find each of them and then find the optimal rectangles sizes for them, so we cover all possibilities. It turns out that each of these equivalence classes can be represented by what is called in the literature mosaic floorplans or diagonal rectangulations.</p>



<p>How to obtain these rectangulations? I will follow (mostly) the method explained in <span id="easy-footnote-1-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-558" title="S. Law, N. Reading, The Hopf algebra of diagonal rectangulations, Preprint, 2010. <a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2118&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>arXiv:1011.2118</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. First, we create a matrix of size \(N\)x\(N\), which conceptually splits the bounding rectangle in cells. We will call it the rectangulation matrix. We number the rectangles consecutively and put the numbers in the matrix diagonal. Then, we choose a permutation (any can do) for the numbers. This permutation determines how the rectangulation will look like. Finally, we follow the order in the permutation to create the rectangles, one by one. To build each rectangle, the rules are</p>



<ol><li> Start from the free cell as left and bottom as possible that can include the cell with the rectangle number</li><li>Do not include cells with numbers for other rectangles</li><li>Make it as big as possible, with the restriction that it must not surpass the right of the rectangle below it and it must not surpass the top of the rectangle to its left. The bottom and left walls of the bounding rectangle are considered bottom and left rectangles for rectangles touching them. </li></ol>



<p>This defines a map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations that we will call \(\rho\). Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the rectangulation \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="425" height="656" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rectangulation.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2 – rectangulation for \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is implemented in the <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code> function. There is a test to create random rectangulations that can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_diagonal_rectangulation_random</a></code></p>



<p>Figure 3 shows an example of a run, with numbered rectangles. The sizes are as returned by <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code>, so we can see that all rectangles have part of them in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/random_rect.svg" alt="" width="394" height="379"><figcaption>Figure 3 – rectangulation for N=10</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out that this map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations is surjective, so it would be interesting to filter out the permutations that produce duplicated rectangulations to reduce the number of calculations. Fortunately, it has been proved that it is possible to establish a bijection between a subset of permutations, called Baxter permutations, and diagonal rectangulations<span id="easy-footnote-2-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, A bijection between permutations and floorplans, and its applications, Discrete Appl.<br>Math. 154 (12) (2006) 1674–1684."><sup>2</sup></a></span>.</p>



<h3>Baxter permutations</h3>



<p>Baxter permutations can be defined by using the generalized pattern avoidance framework<span id="easy-footnote-3-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-558" title="E. Babson, E. Steingrímsson, Generalized permutation patterns and a classification of the Mahonian statistics, Sém. Lothar.<br>Combin. 44 (2000) Art. B44b, 18 pp. (electronic)."><sup>3</sup></a></span>. The way it works is that a sequence is Baxter if there is no subsequence of 4 elements that you can find in it that matches one of the generalized patterns 3-14-2 and 2-41-3. This is an interesting topic but I do not want to digress too much: I have based my implementation on the definition of section 2 of <span id="easy-footnote-4-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-558" title="N. Reading,Generic rectangulations.European J. Combin.33(2012) 610–623 <a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3093&quot;>arXiv:1105.3093</a>."><sup>4</sup></a></span>. The function <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L337" target="_blank">is_baxter_permutation()</a></code> checks whether a sequence is Baxter or not by generating all possible subsequences of 4 elements and checking if they avoid the mentioned patterns. An example using it can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_baxter_permutation</a></code></p>



<p>Using Baxter permutations to filter out permutations can save lots of time for bigger \(N\). For instance, for \(N=10\), only around 10% of the permutations are Baxter. There is a closed form formula for the number of Baxter permutations as a function of \(N\)<span id="easy-footnote-5-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-558" title="F.R.K. Chung, R.L. Graham, V.E. Hoggatt Jr., M. Kleiman, The number of Baxter permutations, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 24<br>(3) (1978) 382–394."><sup>5</sup></a></span>, so we can compare easily with the total number of permutations, \(N!\).</p>



<h3>Rectangle equations</h3>



<p>Once we have a rectangulation, we need to extract the equations that define the relations between widths and heights across the rectangles. To do this, we can loop through the rectangulation matrix and detect the limits between rectangles, which define horizontal and vertical segments. When found, we will create an equation that defines that the sum of the widths/heights of the rectangles at each side of the segment must be equal. There will be also two equations for the  bounding rectangle that make the sum of width/height of rectangles at the side be equal to the total width/height. Note that these are 2 and not 4 equations, as 2 of the 4 we can extract would be linearly dependent on the full set of equations (this can be seen because if we take the equation on one side and follow the parallel segments equations while moving to the opposite side we can deduce the rectangles that touch the bounding rectangle at the opposite limit). Example of the equation sets that would be extracted are those we have already seen for the rectangulations in figure 1. In the slightly more complex case of figure 2, the equations would be</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_2 &amp; = &amp; w_3+w_5 \\<br>w_1+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w_4 \\<br>h_1+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2+h_3 \\<br>h_3+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h_5<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>The function that implements this algorithm is <code><a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build_rectangulation_equations()</a></code>. It returns a matrix with the equation coefficients that will be used when optimizing the rectangulations.</p>



<p>The final number of linearly independent equations we will get will be always \(N+1\). This is a corollary of Lemma 2.3 from <span id="easy-footnote-6-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, On the number of rectangulations of a planar point set, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 113 (6) (2006) 1072–1091."><sup>6</sup></a></span>. This lemma defines two operations, “Flip” and “Rotate”, that allow transforming any rectangulation on another one by a finite number of these operations. These operations do not modify the number of segments in the rectangulation. Therefore, we could transform any rectangulation in one having only, say, vertical segments. This rectangulation …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>I recently installed a rocket.chat server which I covered here</p><figure><a href="https://tech.davidfield.co.uk/rocket-chat/"><div><p>Rocket Chat, yes it’s better than Teams.</p><p>There are a fair few Rocket Chat blogs published over the last few weeks. Sothis post is going to show you how to install it and some cool things you can dowith it.

While it works really well, its also very expensive (at time of writing) from the free tier to the next one up.</p><p>Turns out the free tier is really just for dev work, as soon as you start using it, it depletes very quickly.</p><p>I understand this, its a business model, and one many businesses use. However as I look to take the entire project self hosted I was interested to see what was available for performing the Zapier/IFTTT type functionality.</p><h3 id="n8n">n8n</h3><p>After a look around I setup n8n</p><figure><a href="https://n8n.io/"><div><p>n8n</p><p>n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool which enables you to connect anything to everything via its open, fair-code model.</p><p><img src="https://n8n.io/favicon.ico"><span>Blog Twitter Github LinkedIn Facebook YouTube</span></p></div><p><img src="https://n8n.io/og-image.jpg"></p></a></figure><p>The business has only been "public" since Oct 2019 and describes itself as </p><blockquote><a href="http://n8n.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">n8n</a>, a Berlin-based company that has built a “fair code” workflow automation platform to let developers quickly integrate any of the apps that they use to work together automatically — from standard third-party APIs to internal tools created by developers themselves</blockquote><p>From my perspective its a a web gui interface backed by code which takes items from X and passes them through gates to Y and displays them.</p><p>Off the bat its not as intuative as the aforementioned Zapier and IFTTT and you will need to get your hands dirty with some code. There is however good comunity support (considering this has only been around for a short time) which is google aware as well.</p><p>I was able to setup a quick and simple n8n workflow for Rocket chat with a bit of googling without reading the documentation.</p><h3 id="installation">Installation</h3><p>n8n is an npm app, and the site does show examples of both running and installing it as an npm app. However I found the quickets method of getting something up and running to see what it looked like was to use the docker container</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code># Spin up a basic container
docker run -it --rm \
--name n8n \
-p 5678:5678 \
-v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
n8nio/n8n:latest</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This will get you what can only be classed as a dev environment, it has no credntials to login with, the webhook stuff only listens on localhost etc. The idea here is to quickly get a test environment to see if n8n is for you.</p><h3 id="proper-installation">Proper Installation</h3><p>If you'd like something a lot more stable and secure setup then head over to the n8n Docker Hub page</p><figure><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/n8nio/n8n"><div><p>Docker Hub</p></div></a></figure><p>Where there ware plenty of options for getting n8n setup in different types of production environment.</p><p>I chose to go a little hybrid in my docker compose as at current i'm using this at home.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>nano docker-compose.yaml</code></pre>

  This is an excuse to have a blog post on the economics of Bitcoin to refer people to. <br> <b>Intended Audience:</b> Laypersons interested or confused about Bitcoin. <br> <b>Reading Time:</b> 15min
</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> (MSTR) had a spare $400M of cash which it decided to shift to Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>When a company has a pile of spare money it doesn’t know what to do with, it’ll normally do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase">buybacks</a> or start paying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend">dividends</a>. That gives the money back to the shareholders, and from an economic perspective the money can get better invested in other more promising companies<a href="#footnote-1-1230" id="note-1-1230" rel="footnote">1</a>. If you have a huge pile of of cash, you probably should be doing other things than leave it in a bank account to gather dust<a href="#footnote-2-1230" id="note-2-1230" rel="footnote">2</a>.</p>
<p>However, this statement from MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor exists to make it clear he’s buying into BTC for all the wrong reasons<a href="#footnote-3-1230" id="note-3-1230" rel="footnote">3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge. This was a deliberate corporate strategy to adopt a bitcoin standard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s unpack it and jump into the economics Bitcoin:</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Or rather BTC doesn’t act as money and there’s no serious future path for BTC to become a form of money. Let’s go back to basics. There are 3 main economic problems money solves:</p>
<p><strong>1. Medium of Exchange.</strong> Before money we had to barter, which led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants">double coincidence of wants</a> problem. When everyone accepts the same money you can buy something from someone even if they don’t like the stuff you own.</p>
<p>As a medium of exchange, BTC is not good. There are significant transaction fees and transaction waiting times built-in to BTC and these worsen the more popular BTC get.</p>
<p>You can test BTC’s usefulness as a medium of exchange for yourself right now: try to order a pizza or to buy a random item with BTC. How many additional hurdles do you have to go through? How many fewer options do you have than if you used a regular currency? How much overhead (time, fees) is there?</p>
<p><strong>2. Unit of Account.</strong> A unit of account is what you compare the value of objects against. We denominate BTC in terms of how many USD they’re worth, so BTC is not a unit of account presently. We can say it’s because of lack of adoption, but really it’s also because the market value of BTC is so volatile.</p>
<p>If I buy a $1000 table today or in 2017, it’s roughly a $1000 table. We can’t say that a 0.4BTC table was a 0.4BTC table in 2017. We’ll expand on this in the next point:</p>
<p><strong>3. Store of Value.</strong> When you create economic value, you don’t want to be forced to use up the value you created right away.</p>
<p>For instance, if I fix your washing machine and you pay me in avocados, I’d be annoyed. I’d have to consume my payment before it becomes brown, squishy and disgusting<a href="#footnote-4-1230" id="note-4-1230" rel="footnote">4</a>. Avocado fruit is not good money because avocados loses value very fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, well-run currencies like the USD, GBP, CAD, EUR, etc. all lose their value at a <strong>low</strong> and most importantly <strong>fairly predictible</strong> rate<a href="#footnote-5-1230" id="note-5-1230" rel="footnote">5</a>. Let’s look at the chart of the USD against BTC:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=660%2C173&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="173" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=3058&amp;ssl=1 3058w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C269&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C201&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=1536%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=2048%2C537&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=1980&amp;ssl=1 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>While the dollar loses value at a predictible rate, BTC is all over the place, which is bad.</p>
<p>One important use money is to write loan contracts. Loans are great. They let people spend now against their future potential earnings, so they can buy houses or start businesses without first saving up for a decade. Loans are good for the economy.</p>
<p>If you want to sign something that says <em>“I owe you this much for that much time”</em> then you need to be able to roughly predict the value of the debt in at the point in time where it’s due.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’ll have a hard time pricing the risk of the loan effectively. This means that you need to charge higher interests. The risk of making a loan in BTC needs to be priced into the interest of a BTC-denominated loan, which means much higher interest rates. High interests on loans are bad, because buying houses and starting businesses are good things.</p>

<p>Some people think that going back to a standard where our money was denominated by a stock of gold (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">Gold Standard</a>) would solve economic problems. This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Having control over supply of your currency is a good thing, as long as it’s well run.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=660%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="480" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?w=1056&amp;ssl=1 1056w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=1024%2C745&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=768%2C559&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Remember that what is desirable is low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a> in the value, not the value itself. When there are wild fluctuations in value, it’s hard for money to do its job well.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, the USD has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat money</a> with no intrinsic value. This means we control the supply of money.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a classic poorly drawn econ101 graph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=660%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The market price for USD is where supply meets demand. The problem with a currency based on an item whose supply is fixed is that the price will necessarily fluctuate in response to changes in demand.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, that a pandemic strikes and that the demand for currency takes a sharp drop. The US imports less, people don’t buy anything anymore, etc. If you can’t print money, you get deflation, which is worsens everything <a href="#footnote-6-1230" id="note-6-1230" rel="footnote">6</a>. On the other hand, if you can make the <a href="https://brrr.money/">money printers go brrrr</a> you can stabilize the price:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=660%2C242&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="242" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?w=928&amp;ssl=1 928w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=768%2C281&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Having your currency be based on a fixed supply isn’t just bad because in/deflation is hard to control <a href="#footnote-7-1230" id="note-7-1230" rel="footnote">7</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also a national security risk…</p>
<p><strong>The story of the guy who crashed gold prices in North Africa</strong></p>
<p>In the 1200s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa">Mansa Munsa</a>, the emperor of the Mali, was rich and a devout Muslim and wanted everyone to know it. So he embarked on a pilgrimage to make it rain all the way to Mecca.</p>
<p>He in fact made it rain so hard he increased the overall supply of gold and unintentionally <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Mansa_Musa_I/">crashed gold prices in Cairo by 20%</a>, wreaking an economic havoc in North Africa that lasted a decade.</p>
<p>This story is fun, the larger point that having your inflation be at the mercy of foreign nations is an undesirable attribute in any currency. The US likes to call some countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_manipulator">currency manipulators</a>, but this problem would be serious under a gold standard.</p>

<p>Since the USD is based on nothing except the US government’s word<a href="#footnote-8-1230" id="note-8-1230" rel="footnote">8</a>, how can we trust USD not to be mismanaged?</p>
<p>The answer is that you can probably trust the fed until political stooges get put in place. Currently, the US’s central bank managing the USD, the Federal Reserve (the Fed for friends &amp; family), has administrative authority. The fed can say <strong>“no”</strong> to dumb requests from the president.</p>
<p>People who have no idea what the fed does like to chant “audit the fed”, but the fed is already one of the best audited US federal entities. The transcripts of <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">all their meetings</a> are out in the open. As is their <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm">balance sheet</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm">what they plan to do and why</a>. If the US should audit anything it’s the Department of Defense which operates without <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/accounting-fraud-and-waste-routine-pentagon/355233/"><em>any accounting at all</em>.</a></p>
<p>It’s easy to see when a central bank will go rogue: it’s when political yes-men are elected to the board.</p>
<p>For example, before printing themselves into hyperinflation, the Venezuelan president appointed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKBN0UL27820160107">sociologist who publicly stated “Inflation does not exist in real life”</a> and instead is a made up capitalist lie. Note what happened mere months after his gaining control over the Venezuelan currency:</p>

<p>This is a key policy. One paper I really like, <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sargent1984.pdf">Sargent (1984) “The end of 4 big inflations”</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential measures that ended hyperinflation in each of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland were, first, the creation of an independent central bank that was legally committed to refuse the government’s demand or additional unsecured credit and, second, a simultaneous alteration in the fiscal policy regime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>hyperinflation stops when the central bank can say “no” to the government.”</em></p>
<p>The US Fed, like other well good central banks, is run by a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">bunch of nerds</a><a href="#footnote-9-1230" id="note-9-1230" rel="footnote">9</a>. When it prints money, even as aggressively as it has it does so for good reasons. You can see why they started printing on March 15th as the COVID lockdowns started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>We’re going to keep printing and lowering rates until jobs are back and inflation is under control. If we print until the sun is blotted out, we’ll print in the shade.</em></p>

<p>Gold is a good asset for doomsday-preppers. If society crashes, gold will still have value.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Gold has held value throughout multiple historic catastrophes over thousands of years. It had value before and after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">Fall of the Western Roman Empire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_and_conquests">Gengis Khan being Gengis Khan</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you erased humanity and started over, the new humans would still find gold to be economically valuable. When Europeans d̶i̶s̶c̶o̶v̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ c̶o̶n̶q̶u̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ g̶e̶n̶o̶c̶i̶d̶e̶d̶ went to America, they found gold to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_mythology">an important item over there too</a>. This is about equivalent to finding humans on Alpha-Centauri and learning that they think gold is a good store of value as well.</p>
<p>Some people are puzzled at this: we don’t even use gold for much! But it has great properties:</p>
<p>First, gold is hard to fake and impossible to manufacture. This makes it good to ascertain payment.</p>
<p>Second, gold doesnt react to oxygen, so it doesn’t rust or tarnish. So it keeps value over time unlike most other materials.</p>
<p>Last, gold is <strong>pretty</strong>. This might sound frivolous, and you may not like it, but jewelry has actual value to humans.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence if you look at a list of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_families">wealthiest families</a>, a large number of them trade in luxury goods.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class">Veblen</a> humans have a profound desire to signal social status, for the same reason peacocks have unwieldy tails. Gold is a great way to achieve that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BTC lacks all these attributes. Its value is largely based on common perception of value. There are a few fundamental drivers of demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Means of Exchange:</strong> if people seriously start using BTC to buy pizzas, then this creates a real demand for the currency to accomplish the short-term exchanges. As we saw previously, I’m not personally sold on this one and it’s currently a negligible fraction of overall demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Criminal uses:</strong> Probably the largest inbuilt …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

		<p><b>TL;DR:</b> GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we’re at a point where other research directions matter more
</p>
<p>I’m only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.</p>
<p>It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00982.pdf">There</a> were at least <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11867.pdf">four</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf">review</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">papers</a> just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we’re also focusing on some incorrect places.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a step back and go over the basics.</p>

<p>We say graphs are a “non-euclidean” data type, but that’s not really true. A regular graph <a href="#footnote-1-1311" id="note-1-1311" rel="footnote">1</a> is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif?resize=412%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="412" height="271" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>It’s weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it “non-euclidean”.</p>
<p>This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, <em>where the non-zero numbers are</em> matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.</p>
<p><strong>If you had the full matrix, life would be easy</strong></p>
<p>If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn’t a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>First, network node embeddings <a href="#footnote-2-1311" id="note-2-1311" rel="footnote">2</a> aren’t a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it’s already a vector of numbers.</p>
<p>Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model <a href="#footnote-3-1311" id="note-3-1311" rel="footnote">3</a> will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we’re attaching to nodes.</p>
<p><strong>NLP is also just fancy matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be <a href="https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/">thought of in terms of graphs</a> as we’ll see, so it’s not a big digression.</p>
<p>First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> are <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/file/feab05aa91085b7a8012516bc3533958-Paper.pdf">just matrix factorization</a>.</p>
<p>The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bag of words</a> matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence">co-occurence</a> graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.</p>
<p>Glove then does matrix factorization <a href="#footnote-4-1311" id="note-4-1311" rel="footnote">4</a> on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent<a href="#footnote-5-1311" id="note-5-1311" rel="footnote">5</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more on this in my <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/02/16/embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">post on embeddings</a> and the one (with code) on <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/01/27/word-embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">word embeddings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Even language models are also just matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the <a href="https://nlpprogress.com/">state of the art</a> in NLP.</p>
<p>Let’s take BERT as our main example<a href="#footnote-6-1311" id="note-6-1311" rel="footnote">6</a>. BERT predicts a word given the context of the rest of the sentence:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=660%2C208&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="208" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=768%2C242&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This grows the matrix we’re factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence’s context<a href="#footnote-7-1311" id="note-7-1311" rel="footnote">7</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=660%2C291&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="291" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=300%2C132&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We’re growing the “ideal matrix” we’re factoring combinatorially <a href="#footnote-8-1311" id="note-8-1311" rel="footnote">8</a>. As noted by <a href="http://socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/papers/hahn2019estimating.pdf">Hanh &amp; Futrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> sense. It’s also possible that huge language models just <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/12/20/lmmem/">memorize a lot of it</a> rather than compress the information, for what it’s worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Can we upsample any graph like language models do?</h3>
<p>We’re already doing it.</p>
<p>Let’s call a <strong>first-order</strong> embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph’s adjacency matrix or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a>. If you embed a graph using <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F03130B02DC485C78BF364266B6F0CA?doi=10.1.1.19.8100&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Laplacian Eigenmaps</a> or by taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal components</a> of the Laplacian, that’s first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0594.pdf">ProNE</a>, which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>A <strong>higher-order</strong> method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806416.2806512">GraRep</a>, shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix <a href="#footnote-9-1311" id="note-9-1311" rel="footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order method are the “upsampling” we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.</p>

<p>Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.</p>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">OpenGraphsBenchmark</a> (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can’t seriously differentiate between methods.</p>
<p>Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Performance matters by task</strong></p>
<p>One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you’re doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx">isn’t much gained</a> from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings <a href="#footnote-10-1311" id="note-10-1311" rel="footnote">10</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/blob/master/examples/link%20prediction.ipynb">I find</a> that for many graphs <strong>simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods</strong>. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases <a href="#footnote-11-1311" id="note-11-1311" rel="footnote">11</a></p>
<p>Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">GGVec with order=1</a> <a href="#footnote-12-1311" id="note-12-1311" rel="footnote">12</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks<a href="#footnote-13-1311" id="note-13-1311" rel="footnote">13</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2636.pdf">real world graphs</a>.</p>
<p>For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by <a href="http://byowen.com/">Owen Cornec</a> <a href="#footnote-14-1311" id="note-14-1311" rel="footnote">14</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=660%2C253&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="253" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?w=994&amp;ssl=1 994w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=768%2C294&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there’s an instance of it in the OGB paper).</p>
<p>The problem here is that <strong>we don’t know when any method is better than another</strong> and <strong>we definitely don’t know the reason</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.</p>
<p>A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because…</p>

<p>Here’s the cynic’s view of how machine learning papers are made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take an existing algorithm</li>
<li>Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters</li>
<li>Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped</li>
<li>Absolutely don’t gridsearch stuff you’re comparing against in your results section</li>
<li>Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github <a href="#footnote-15-1311" id="note-15-1311" rel="footnote">15</a> and bask in the citations</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03341.pdf">not</a> the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kee4ch3miVA">only one</a> with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it’s gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.</p>
<h3>Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec</h3>
<p>A side project of mine is a <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">node embedding library</a> and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don’t use Node2Vec.</p>
<p><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf">Node2Vec</a> with <code>p=1; q=1</code> is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf">Deepwalk</a> algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.</p>
<p>The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.</p>
<p>This is not academic fraud — the hyperparameters <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11726.pdf">do help a tiny bit</a> if you gridsearch really hard. But it’s the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn’t deserve 7500 citations.</p>

<p>We’ve known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was <strong>practical</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we’ve known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware<a href="#footnote-16-1311" id="note-16-1311" rel="footnote">16</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You’re disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google’s original search algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_data_centers#Original_hardware">initially ran on commodity hardware</a> <a href="#footnote-17-1311" id="note-17-1311" rel="footnote">17</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency is paramount to progress</strong></p>
<p>The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/">efficiency</a> as well as much better libraries and hardware support<a href="#footnote-18-1311" id="note-18-1311" rel="footnote">18</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Academic code is terrible</strong></p>
<p>Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself <a href="#footnote-19-1311" id="note-19-1311" rel="footnote">19</a>. The problem is that people don’t gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.</p>
<p>I wrote the <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/08/01/700x-faster-node2vec-models-fastest-random-walks-on-a-graph/">Nodevectors library</a> to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took <strong>32 hours</strong> to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It’s no wonder people don’t gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.</p>
<p>To give an example, in the original paper of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf">GraphSAGE</a> they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5 <a href="#footnote-20-1311" id="note-20-1311" rel="footnote">20</a>. From their paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for &gt;1000× …</p></blockquote></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><p>While I had some time off over Christmas I decided it would be useful to read up on product validation. Especially after the launch of my first startup, Readercatch, which although launching quite successfully on ProductHunt failed to generate any meaningful conversion.</p><p>I created a site called validationguide.com (using <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) to host all this research. Upon researching the topic, I realized something, Almost all product validation methods for successful bootstrapped companies are the same.</p><p>There's the odd sneaky company that uses Ads or just launches a product without validation. But for the most part almost all validated companies do these things:</p><h3>1) Listen To People</h3><p>Whether it's selling <a href="http://justinmares.com/how-i-validated-my-idea-for-kettle-fire/">Bone Broth</a> or <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">launching the next platform for App deals</a>. <strong>Validating products requires listening to people's problems first</strong>.</p><p>In other words for your product to be validated you need to start talking to people and asking them about their problems, what's taking up their time at work, etc.</p><p>For Kettle &amp; Fire it was Justin's friends talking about how great Bone Broth was and Justin finding out that no business sold Bone Broth online. For App Sumo it was Kagan's last startup, Gambit, where he learned that startups wanted more users over more revenue.</p><h3>2) Sell Sell Sell</h3><p>Nowadays when a startup is launching you see the plain old email signup landing page. That's great if you're the next X in tech and everyone's hyping about you, but for validating your customer's needs an email sign up box sucks.</p><p>Instead try creating a fake (or real) checkout flow for the product that doesn't exist yet. Justin validated Kettle &amp; Fire by creating an Unbounce landing page with a PayPal checkout and knew he was onto something when he received $500 in orders. App Sumo validated it's business model by running Reddit Ads and selling pro Imgur accounts. Drip validated it's problem by emailing a bunch of founders asking about email marketing.</p><p>Being lean doesn't mean building the full product. In fact if you can get someone to pay you based off an idea then you're onto a real winner of a business.</p><h3>3) Find A Way To Easily Reach Customers</h3><p>So you've found a group of customers who have a problem and you want to see if your solution will solve it for them. Here's a few quick ways:</p><ol><li>Cold email/message/call your target customer (How Drip got started)</li><li>Run FB/Google/Bing/Etc Ads (How Kettle &amp; Fire got started)</li><li>Write blog content and share it online about how your product solves X and Y (How Basecamp got started)</li></ol><p><strong>Your target customer should be so relieved that your product exists that they should be willing to pay for it.</strong> Don't make the mistake of building something nice to have.</p></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide.

In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale.

Many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-coronavirus-as-deadly-as-they-say-11585088464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemiologists</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a> questioned these doomsday projections and pointed out that there was <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not sufficient data</a> to justify lockdowns.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus. In reality lockdowns have accelerated a cycle of austerity and created a self-fulfilling prophecy of perpetual crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nursing-home-deaths-coronavirus-understaffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understaffing</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/nyregion/nursing-home-workers-pandemic-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown-induced layoffs</a> in nursing homes severely exacerbated covid’s death toll. 40% of US covid deaths are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/06/16/nursing-homes-account-for-over-40-of-us-coronavirus-deaths/?sh=54afb581300b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">linked to nursing homes</a>. 1 in 6 covid deaths in Vermont were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/02/vermont-nursing-home-covid-genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a single facility</a>. In New York (the state with the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second highest</a> covid deaths per million) hospitals sent over 6,300 elderly covid patients <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/new-york-hospitals-sent-6300-recovering-covid-patients-to-nursing-homes/2502812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back into nursing homes</a>. Unprotected, underserved, and alone, the elderly are also afflicted by the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/us/nursing-homes-isolation-virus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow killer</a>” of loneliness. Isolation increases risk of <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/loneliness-and-isolation-raise-risk-for-stroke-and-heart-disease-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease, stroke</a>, and <a href="https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/feeling-lonely-increases-alzheimers-risk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s</a>. It is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20180504/loneliness-rivals-obesity-smoking-as-health-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as deadly</a> as obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</p>



<p>Financial insecurity will exacerbate these health risks for the elderly. Economic shutdown has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1fce3e7-428b-4b8a-ab6a-119a38fa1e7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened</a> global pension funds and they may not recover. Millions of Baby Boomers have been forced into <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/11/19/nearly-30-million-baby-boomers-forced-into-unwanted-retirement/?sh=4fb8019d5d7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early retirement</a> without adequate savings. Many Americans are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/americans-are-forced-to-raid-retirement-savings-during-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dipping into their retirement funds early</a>. The Congressional Budget Office projects that $2.8 trillion in Social Security funds will be <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/528268-covid-19-damage-to-social-security-to-extend-beyond-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used up in a decade</a> due to the impact of un- and underemployment on lowering contributions.</p>

<p>Outcomes of lockdown are equally grim for children. Even if K-12 schools reopen in January 2021, the average student will have lost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 months of instruction</a>. Because literacy and education levels are a main <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2713445/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictor of longevity</a>, these learning losses represent years of life stolen from students. Moreover, cases of severe abuse and mental-health related ER visits <a href="https://apnews.com/article/anxiety-mental-health-boston-coronavirus-pandemic-massachusetts-004adb5ee0ef17ff4b5e2e294e36ff3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are surging for children</a>. They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by.

In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>.

<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods.

In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction.
