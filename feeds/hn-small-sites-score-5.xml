<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>Main</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_CSR</span> <span>:=</span>
    <span>(</span><span>CLKSOURCE</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span> <span>--  cpu clock</span>

     <span>others</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Ticks</span> <span>:</span> <span>Natural</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>Export</span>        <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>,</span>
         <span>Convention</span>    <span>=&gt;</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span>
         <span>External_Name</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"isr_systick"</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>Ticks</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Ticks</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>SysTick_Handler</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>procedure</span> <span>Wait</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>Machine_Code</span><span>.</span><span>Asm</span> <span>(</span><span>"wfi"</span><span>,</span> <span>Volatile</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>True</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Wait</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>if</span> <span>SysTick</span><span>.</span><span>Ticks</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>then</span>
      <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
      <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Next_Blink</span> <span>+</span> <span>1_000</span><span>;</span>
   <span>end</span> <span>if</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SysTick</span><span>.</span><span>Wait</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IT BLINKS! Not precisely at 1 Hz, as the ring oscillator isn’t accurate, but close enough for this demo.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>

                                </div>
                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
</article><p>Well done! You've reached the end of my post. Now you can <a href="">leave a comment</a> or read something else.</p></div>]]>

		<p>With the exception of exchanges, scammers, YouTube channels and news sites full of filler and ads, and whales like Michael Saylor, it would seem hardly anyone is making money with cryptocurrency. Despite Bitcoin going from $10k to $40k in less than two months, one is still hard-pressed to find many success stories or evidence of ordinary people getting rich buying and holding or trading crypto. A few days ago I scanned the popular Reddit subs r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency for posts of people who had made sizable sums of money with crypto, and I only found two: someone who had bought a $10,000 Omega watch with their crypto gains, and someone else who made $63,000. Sure, this is better than nothing , but not exactly life-changing amounts of money, especially given how well Bitcoin has done over the past year. By contract, on /r/wallstreetbets there are pages up pages of people making hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars seemingly effortlessly with stock options and with buy and hold. Sure, some on /r/wallstreetbets lose a fortune too, but even in spite of large losses, it would seem that there is far more wealth to be made with stock trading compared to cryptocurrency. It is not even close. I had to dig through dozens of pages to find even just a handful of people who had made a sizable amount of money with crypto, whereas on /r/wallstreetbets it’s the opposite.</p>
<p>Where are the millionaires? Surely there must be some. This is not to say that no one has gotten rich with crypto. There are people who bought Bitcoin from 2010-2013 and are sitting on large fortunes. But one would think that there would be dozens of posts every week from newly-minted crpyto millionaires bragging about their gains. One explanation is that bragging this incurs the risk of having your funds stolen, but it is not like you can break into someone’s cold storage wallet from a Reddit account. I imagine that anyone with a fortune would know how to share a screenshot or make a post without compromising their crypto.</p>
<p>So why has crypto been such a loser despite the bull market over the past 2 years, especially compared to stocks? Why aren’t people making money with crypto, but stock trading millionaires are a dime a dozen? There are several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Crypto has too much volatility and hence poor risk-adjusted returns compared to stocks. Whereas many stocks and indexes tend to exhibit a gentle rising slope over the duration of the post-2009 bull market, punctuated by a deep but brief dip due to Covid, crypto tends to zig and zag unpredictably. This is bad for many reasons: too much volatility makes it harder, psychologically, to stay in the market without panic selling at a loss or taking profits too soon. Although bitcoin may have higher absolute returns compared to the Nasdaq , the volatility is considerably higher. This also makes it harder to apply leverage strategies, further minimizing returns. If the Nasdaq has 25% annual returns but 10% draw-downs vs. 50% returns for Bitcoin but 30% drawdowns, you can use 4-1 leverage on the Nasdaq and make 100% in a year with a 40% maximum draw-down, but even applying 2-1 leverage on Bitcoin will give you 100% return but a 60% maximum draw-down. Clearly, stocks provide better risk-adjusted returns with leverage.</p>
<p>Leveraged stock strategies such as buying and holding 3x ETFs such as FNGU,TQQQ, and TECL, have outperformed Bitcoin since 2018. In early 2018, when Bitcoin was at $12k or so, I recommended FNGU as an alternative to Bitcoin (as a sort of high-risk but high return investment). Three years later, FNGU is up over 500% vs. 350% for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>2. No options market with crypto. Stock options allow small returns of the underlying index or stock to be magnified, but options trading is still very limited with crypto. It is possible, but it does not work nearly as well as stock option trading.</p>
<p>3. Too hard and cumbersome to deposit and withdrawal large sums of and crypto and or fiat. Even after 911, given all of the Patriot Act restrictions, I found it very easy to deposit money in a brokerage account and begin trading. All I had to do was wire money to the broker and within 3 days I was able to trade. With crypto, often you need ID cards and proof of funds due to various arbitrary compliance and anti-money laundering restrictions and regulations. Prior to 2017, it was easy to transfer funds and crypto in and out of exchanges, but criminals inevitably abused and exploited the good will of exchanges. That is usually what happens with these sort of things: all it takes is a few bad actors to permanently ruin it for everyone else. Two decades later, we still have to take off our shoes at the airport because someone had the brilliant idea of smuggling a bomb in their shoe.</p>
<p>4. Too small of position sizes. On /r/wallstreetbets it is not uncommon to see traders in their 20s or 30s make bets of ten thousand dollars or more on a single option trade. Yet for some reason with crypto everyone is skinflint and risk averse. It’s like “I deposited $50 into my Coinbase” is the norm. You’re not going to get rich with such as small investment even if Bitcoin goes up 100x. It is the same age group and demographic buying stock as buying crypto, so it’s not like the crypto traders should have less money.</p>
<p>5. Gains do not hold. GME stock started at $3 in 2020 and a year later is still above $100. Stocks tend to ‘trend’ which means that past price movement predicts future direction. If a stock has risen 70 out of the past 100 days, likely it will keep rising, at least for the foreseeable future. This is known as momentum, and there is evidence that in spite of the efficient market hypothesis, that it exists. With crypto, sometimes an altcoin will get pumped 100% in a day and then the next day give up most of its gains, and then a week later be back to where it started. It is hard to make money off that because there is no follow-through or trend to ride higher. It s not like Gsamestock, which kept going up for many months, or, like Tesla, which went from $70 to $900 over 2 years.</p>
<p>6. As discussed <a href="https://greyenlightenment.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-good-investment/">earlier</a>, crypto is more like a commodity than a stock. Whereas stocks tend to generate shareholder value in the form of retained earnings, dividends, or buybacks, crypto does not generate earnings that can be passed on to investors. Also, crypto has more inflation than stocks, as some inflation (between 2-5%) is built into crypto protocols, whereas with stocks the supply tends to shrink over time due to buybacks. Historically, for these reasons, commodities tend to have far worse returns than stocks.</p>

However, I have started noticing that many software development problems might be caused by people being too positive and passionate. Let me explain.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="d047">Isn’t it weird that so many young people are already feeling burnt out after a few years of work? I keep meeting people who need a break after just their first year or two. I’ve also experienced burnout myself (twice even). The first time, I had to take a six-month break. The second time, which was very recent, I needed a full year off before I could come back to programming.</p><p id="41b7">This year, I’ve spent a lot of time with people outside tech and noticed one thing: We don’t complain much about our work. We complain about bad bosses and bad projects, but not about coding itself. We take passion for granted. Surprised? Go through job offers. Passion is often one of the must-haves listed on them. We are expected to love our job, and even more, we are expected to make programming the center of our universes.</p><p id="31ae">But what about the people who do not love programming and still do their job all the same? Try to identify yourself as one of those among your colleagues or on Twitter, and you will immediately be dismissed as being a bad developer. However, is that really the case? People who do their job and try something different after working hours can be amazing programmers too. Not everyone needs to come home and work on side projects, create blog posts and YouTube videos about coding, and read programming books for fun.</p><p id="4a37">I have been one of those people trying to work through all my spare time. For many years, I felt guilty if I didn’t spend all my waking time chasing some imaginary productivity goal — and guess where that landed me?</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Woman burying her head into her arms" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10368/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*l98RdTZoTBOn_FfC?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nicotitto?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">nrd</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="61c0">Another aspect that is heavily biased against negative feedback is following new trends originating from FAANG companies. Try to speak up against SOA or Docker. Try to propose using an older, more mature language and SSR. It’s similar to having a passion for work. People immediately conclude that you are not a good developer, as you are “blocking the progress.”</p><p id="85a7">Not everyone is running thousands of microservices like Uber and not every company needs K8S. However, it’s hard not to get on board — or at least pretend to be on board. How many organizations fail to migrate to React or Angular and are left with a code base split between the old “bad” code that was working and the new code that developers are still fighting to make work?</p><p id="0a7d">This recent article shows the reality in many organizations:</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="ddd8">When I was a Technical Lead, I often heard the phrase “because it is a good practice.” I would then ask further questions and often noticed that the person didn’t quite understand the solution. It was my litmus test to know when to dig deeper.</p><p id="ec4f">How many of these “universal” best practices aren’t really universal? DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is often said in the same sentence as KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), yet they are often mutually exclusive practices. “Simple” means no unnecessary abstractions, yet starting with DRY code leads exactly to premature abstractions.</p><p id="9470">I personally use <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">the rule of 3X</a>:</p><blockquote><p id="3f47">“We have the delusion of reuse. Don’t feel bad. It’s an endemic disease among software developers. An occupational hazard, really.</p><p id="371b">…</p><p id="64fa">- It is three times as difficult to build reusable components as single-use components, and<br>- A reusable component should be tried out in three different applications before it will be sufficiently general to accept into a reuse library.” — <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rule-of-three/" rel="noopener">Coding Horror</a></p></blockquote><p id="6a10">Obviously, I don’t treat it as a maxim. It’s more of a rule of thumb than good practice. But even here, we are getting to the same problem. People who dare suggest using singleton or any other hated anti-patterns are perceived as less than stellar developers.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="dc25">The expectation that <em>real</em> software developers, hackers, and geeks are defined by their vocation feels like being in some sort of RPG game. Your trade will forever define you, and once you choose this path, there is no way back.</p><p id="d74d">We, as developers, are expected to love programming. But why? The simple truth is that it is good for employers. How many horror stories have come out of game dev? Yet many young people dream about working in the gaming industry only to be replaced by another batch of young, naive people after a few years.</p><p id="b875">We need to normalize people not “loving” to code, and we need to normalize having a healthy work-life balance in tech. We need people to be more open about their opinions, even if they are against the moment’s hype.</p><p id="62c6">Don’t get me wrong, I really like being a software developer and I like programming. However, I am not sure if I love it being the center of my universe anymore.</p><p id="e18c">I want to try other things, and that is absolutely OK.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><p>March 2nd, 2021</p><p>Today I am happy to announce <a href="https://github.com/gordalina/hush">Hush</a>, the simplest way to inject secrets into your app configuration.</p><p>Hush was purpose built to solve a common use case for projects that require secrets and want to inject them in a secure way without having to depend on secret files or hardcoded configuration.</p><h2>Background &amp; Motivation</h2><p>As an web applications engineer, I've always been interested in understanding and engineering the whole stack, from managing &amp; configuring servers, all the way up the stack to frontend development. In my journey of working at several startups, and building my own projects, I've developed a an infrastructure engineering skillset.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2020, I was working on a new project and wanted to deploy an Elixir API in a containerized environment and realized that, by default, Elixir apps include a <code>prod.secrets.exs</code> which is used to configure an application in a production environment.</p><p>The standard approach would require us to build docker images on a per-environment basis, which would have to include said secrets within them — this was not an ideal scenario.</p><p>Slab, <a href="https://slab.com/">the knowledge base that democratizes knowledge</a>, discovered the limits of this production configuration. As their team grew, sharing and maintaining this approach became more difficult — as did the security concerns of having secrets in docker images.</p><p>As such, there was a need for a tool that could solve these problems and enable the deployment of docker images to any environment without having hardcoded secrets, as well as solving for config &amp; dev/prod parity in the <a href="https://12factor.net/">twelve factor app methodology</a>.</p><p>Hush demonstrated that it elegantly solved the problem and simplified their environment.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Hush implements Elixir's <code>Config.Provider</code> behavior, giving you a familiar and supported way to configure Elixir applications.</p><p>In this example we can see a production configuration using three providers; AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and System Environment.</p><pre><p><span></span><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>Hush</span><span>.</span><span>Provider</span><span>.</span><span>{</span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Web</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>http:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>port:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>SystemEnvironment</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"PORT"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>cast:</span><span> </span><span>:integer</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GcpSecretManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"CLOUDSQL_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>config </span><span>:app</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>.</span><span>RedshiftRepo</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>password:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:hush</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>AwsSecretsManager</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"REDSHIFT_PASSWORD"</span><span>}</span></p></pre><h2>Features</h2><p>Hush ships, today, with the following features:</p><ul><li>Extensible providers.

		<p>At Replit we believe that computers give people superpowers. With computers, anyone who's willing to learn can spend more of their time on creative invention rather than tedious drudgery. They help us automate repetitive tasks and build on the collective knowledge of all the great thinkers, inventors, artists, and teachers who came before us. </p>
<p>Computer science teachers around the world are bestowing these superpowers upon the next generation of creators and builders. We built <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Replit Teams for Education</a> for them, and today we're officially taking Teams for Education out of beta. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wgl_ERg23O4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">Sign up for a free trial</a> if you haven't already!</p>
<p>Thank you teachers for beta testing Teams, for giving us invaluable product feedback, for helping one another out as part of a vibrant and diverse community of Replers, and for being a part of the history of computers.</p>
<p>William Gibson is famous for saying way back in 1992, that "the future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed." If we asked you a year ago, you may have said we were already living in the computer age, or even that we had been for decades. But then in early 2020 COVID-19 happened and everything went "remote" and we all took a collective leap even further into the future. Today it's more obvious than ever that for children (and adults!) to participate in the riches of the new economy, they need to be able to design, control, and program the machines that we all use all day, every day.</p>
<p>On this vision to build powerful &amp; approachable tools that expand access to computing superpowers, Replit raised a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/seriesa">$20 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020. We're using the funds both to make learning more engaging for teachers and students and also to make work more fun and creative for professional software developers. We believe that the same things that make programming easier for beginners will also unlock productivity for experts. And when students know that they aren't just in a sandboxed, toy environment, but instead can use real-world tools and collaborate in real-time with their peers, they'll learn better.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/multiplayerart.png" alt="replit multiplayer art"></p>
<p>We've been working towards this vision since Amjad and Haya started Replit in 2016. And the initial beta release of Teams for Education over the summer of 2020 was a major step forward in that direction. From the start, early adopters like Toni loved the real-time multiplayer collaboration with their students, seeing how Replit could transform their classrooms.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/replit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@replit</a> absolute game changer for coding. Supports so many languages, easy to use. My favourite feature is multiplayer option! My must have tool for coding.</p>— Toni Scullion (@ScullionToni) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScullionToni/status/1328364755657121794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2020</a></blockquote> 


<p>But there was much more to do before Teams would be ready to graduate from beta. We listened to our teachers. Then we rolled up our sleeves and started building fast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/education-privacy">privacy compliance</a> (FERPA, COPPA, GDPR, and more)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">code annotations for feedback</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/group-projects-teams-education">group projects</a></li>
<li>simplified pricing</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-edu-fall-2020-improvements">feedback workflow improvements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/how-far">stability improvements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/input-output-tests">input/output autograding</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/fix-gfx">graphics improvements</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/teams-education-january-update">better project organization</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/teamsforedu-01-22-2021">project sharing</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://blog.repl.it/unit-tests">built-in unit tests for Java, Python, and Javascript</a></li>
<li>project overview and reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're going to keep on shipping! In the coming days and weeks, look out for live handraising to get help, project due dates, easier billing and team organization, major updates to annotations (now called threads), and more. If there's something else you want us to build, <a href="https://replit.canny.io/teams-for-education">let us know</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/threads.png" alt="threads"></p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who's been teaching with Teams for helping us set the product direction. There's still more to do, but Teams for Education has finally reached a point where we're proud to officially release it. We're excited to keep hearing success stories from teachers like Michele and Pete.</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It. Will. Change. Your. Life. Teams allows you to create a repl, automatically forks it for each student or group, and you never lose access. In breakout rooms or the classroom, I can see what each kid/group is working on in real time and pop in when I need to</p>— MicheleLombardi (@Lombardi_M_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lombardi_M_/status/1362464185842618370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2021</a></blockquote> 


<blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have been using teams with my 9 Higher pupils this week and it is a game changer - especially when remote coding. The ability to drop in and out of their projects is a game changer. I have also bought my own personal sub to be able to keep projects private.</p>— Pete Graham (@Petergra) <a href="https://twitter.com/Petergra/status/1358117048505802758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></blockquote> 


<p>But it's not just these couple teachers. In the past 7 months of the beta, we've reached ~1,000 paying Teams customers (and thousands more currently on free trials). We're serving elementary schools, high schools, colleges and universities, bootcamps, nonprofits, and every type of educational institution. And the schools using Replit are incredibly diverse with over 30% majority minority and over half with &gt;45% of their students on free or reduced-price lunch.</p>
<p>With so much collective brainpower and experience across our community, we're working hard to connect teachers to one another to share best practices. If you haven't already, <a href="https://repl.it/talk/all">join Repl talk</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/replitforcseducation">our teachers' group on Facebook</a>. We'll be attending the <a href="https://sigcse2021.sigcse.org/">SIGCSE conference</a> in March and would love to see you at <a href="https://repl.it/sigcse2021">our presentation</a>. We'll be at <a href="https://www.csteachers.org/page/csta-2021">CSTA</a> over the summer as well. More details to come. We'll be resuming "office hours" (video call sessions with our team) in the coming weeks and sending a survey to ask your time preferences. And to help us out on all these fronts, we'll soon be adding another teacher from the community to our team. </p>
<p>Finally, the Replit team is doing a book club, and we'd love to have you join.

March 2, 2021 | https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://releaseapp.io/blog/why-kubernetes-is-so-hard">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Kubernetes (k8s) has been all the rage for the last few years because application orchestration has become a de facto table-stakes requirement for production workloads running containers. “Containerising” applications is <em>relatively</em> straightforward, and most DevOps engineers worth their salt can create a few Dockerfiles and build images in a pipeline that are ready to run. But where do you “run” your Docker containers? And which versions do you deploy? And how do all the containers talk to each other? This is where orchestration comes into play and where a few options are proposed by large vendors. There are two main options available at the time of this writing: Elastic Container Service (ECS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Kubernetes which is offered by all the Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) providers, including even AWS.</p><p>The hope is that orchestration will allow companies to deliver their containerised applications to test and integration environments quickly and painlessly. The ideal scenario is that it “just works”, that is, you would snap your fingers and wait a few minutes before you see your application running in front of you. Ideally, you’d only need to specify the minimum information necessary to run your application: name, framework, dependencies, and so forth, preferably read out from existing configuration files you already have available. That’s the hope anyway.</p><p>Obviously, from the title, we are focusing on Kubernetes, mainly because it is available everywhere and mainly because the only <em>other</em> option is ECS which only proves the point of our thesis that Kubernetes is hard to use because AWS came up with their own solution that is <em>supposed to be</em> easier. But why is it so hard to use? How long would it reasonably take to get your application(s) running in K8s?? And why isn’t it easier?</p><h2 id="kubernetes-infrastructure-is-hard">Kubernetes Infrastructure Is Hard</h2><p>We always start with the infrastructure even though most companies wouldn’t build their own Kubernetes clusters themselves. If you were ever going to use a managed infrastructure service, K8s would be at the top of the list. I’m sure there are a few people who start up <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" title="Minikube documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">minikube</a> on their laptops and say to themselves, “Wow, this is easy! I can do this myself!!” This reminds me of people who start up an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-elastic-stack.html" title="Elasticsearch getting started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a> container on their laptop and say, “Wow, we should implement this for our website!!” Fast forward to a production launch six months or a year later and the simple “We can do this ourselves” mantra turns into “I wish we didn’t have to do this anymore.”</p><p>If you were truly going to build your own Kubernetes cluster, you’d need to build all the control plane servers and services on your bare-metal or Virtual Machines (VMs) from an IaaS of choice, and then tie them all together with some fancy networking configuration to separate control-plane traffic from container traffic. You’d need to configure and run all of the control plane software and get them all talking to each other, running stably and monitored properly. Perversely, you’d be orchestrating the containers that orchestrate the application, but without a lot of orchestration! The fancy mirage that’s presented when you run minikube or Docker Desktop on Windows hides all the inception of running a container orchestration system using containers.</p><p>We haven’t even gotten to the complications of setting up ingresses (which are just nginx instances, usually) and load balancers that sit on top of or next to the control plane stack. A lot of the time, you’ll feel like you are creating a whole infrastructure just for your infrastructure to run (which isn’t unusual, but definitely doesn’t feel better than trying to orchestrate things yourself). We also haven’t gotten into the Role Based Authentication Controls and network policies that need to be set to support more than a single application or stack running in one cluster. The number of configuration points and server-side setups start to mount quickly and we haven’t even started orchestrating applications yet, which is the whole point of the orchestration system we’re supposed to be setting up.</p><p>And let’s suppose that you really do wade out into this deep North Atlantic Ocean of huge waves and death-inducing freezing waters, and build yourself a production-worthy ship that can orchestrate your containers into an actual application. You look back up at your calendar and it’s been six months or a year since you started, and you’re just now deploying a control plane that says, “Hello World!” You think you’re successful and you’re about to celebrate when you check the releases section on the website and now you have a new version of k8s to deploy!!!</p><p>I hear what you’re saying, “We’re <code>large company</code> and we have <code>lots of</code> DevOps engineers who are <code>top decile</code> of engineering talent in the whole world. We can handle all the heavy lifting. You’re just a whining, jealous baby.” I see you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDm9iNkLyPI" title="Datadog on Kubernetes presentation video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Datadog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg" title="Ticketmaster presents the keynote at Kubecon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ticketmaster</a>. (By the way, your accusations of jealousy might be correct. At the end of my good friend Justin Dean’s keynote speech where he shows the slides with all the team members, my picture should have been up there — but I had left the team two years earlier.) For everyone else, we all just decide to not spend six months or a year trying to build our control plane and start up our IaaS provider’s managed service and cross our fingers and pray.</p><h2 id="k8s-yaml-aint-markup-language">K8s YAML Ain’t Markup Language</h2><p>If you’ve skipped ahead and just started up a managed k8s cluster, you’re still in for a long and tedious journey wading into a deep sea of confusing YAML. YAML is to text what James Joyce’s <em><a href="https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/fw01.htm" title="Read Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Finnegan’s Wake</a></em> is to English. If you close one eye, use only your left pinky and right thumb to follow some brail, put your feet into ballet’s fifth position, and then recite World War II codes under your breath, then you will easily see that YAML is quite a breeze to comprehend. Once you get the hang of it, it’s like riding a bicycle over a frozen lake on centimeter-thin ice with rabid wolves chasing you. It’s as easy as trying to crash the Ancient Aliens cocktail party held in Fort Knox on gold smuggling days.</p><p>Look, it’s not actually that hard, right? Let’s say a guy walks up to you on the street. He’s a k8s expert and he’s going to show you how easy the “hello world” web service deployment is. The conversation goes like this:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>You: “Oh, I see. Yes, I like it.”</span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1beta1.”</span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>You: “Uh, okay. Isn’t v1beta1 out of date? You can use v1 as of k8s 1.9.</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>It’s actually removed in 1.16, but I wonder how many people have never</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>updated.”</span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Him: “Start over.”</span></p><p><span>12</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span></p><p><span>15</span><span>Him: “kind: Deployment”</span></p><p><span>16</span><span></span></p><p><span>17</span><span>You: “Stop with the Kinds everywhere!”</span></p><p><span>18</span><span></span></p><p><span>19</span><span>Him: “apiVersion: apps/v1”</span></p><p><span>20</span><span></span></p><p><span>21</span><span>You: “This again.”</span></p><p><span>22</span><span></span></p><p><span>23</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>24</span><span></span></p><p><span>25</span><span>You: “Huh??”</span></p><p><span>26</span><span></span></p><p><span>27</span><span>Him: “selector:”</span></p><p><span>28</span><span></span></p><p><span>29</span><span>You: “No.”</span></p><p><span>30</span><span></span></p><p><span>31</span><span>Him: “matchLabels:”</span></p><p><span>32</span><span></span></p><p><span>33</span><span>You: “Wat.”</span></p><p><span>34</span><span></span></p><p><span>35</span><span>Him: “app: nginx”</span></p><p><span>36</span><span></span></p><p><span>37</span><span>You: “That’s nearly the first thing I’ve understood about this so far.”</span></p><p><span>38</span><span></span></p><p><span>39</span><span>Him: “spec:”</span></p><p><span>40</span><span></span></p><p><span>41</span><span>You: “Again?”</span></p><p><span>42</span><span></span></p><p><span>43</span><span>Him: “containers:”</span></p><p><span>44</span><span></span></p><p><span>45</span><span>You: “Okay, now we’re getting somewhere.”</span></p><p><span>46</span><span></span></p><p><span>47</span><span>Him: “image: nginx:1.14.2”</span></p><p><span>48</span><span></span></p><p><span>49</span><span>You: “Hmm.”</span></p><p><span>50</span><span></span></p><p><span>51</span><span>Him: “ports:”</span></p><p><span>52</span><span></span></p><p><span>53</span><span>You: “Aiiiiieeee.”</span></p><p><span>54</span><span></span></p><p><span>55</span><span>Him: “containerPort: 80”</span></p><p><span>56</span><span></span></p><p><span>57</span><span>You: “I’m going home. I quit. There must be a devops job I can get where</span></p><p><span>58</span><span>I work on [Gatsby blogs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ "Gatsby nodejs frontend")</span></p><p><span>59</span><span>all day.”</span></p></pre></div><p>And that’s just trying to read and understand the file. Try reading two k8s yaml examples and then generate one yourself from scratch. Even better, every day try a <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Practice a code kata daily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code kata</a> practice of writing working and deployable configurations to Kubernetes.</p><p>I DARE YOU.</p><h2 id="copy-paste-aint-code">Copy Paste Ain’t Code</h2><p>I’m still chuckling over the previous section. I have to chuckle because this is the daily pain of my day-to-day existence and facing that pain directly is like standing in front of a bus being driven by Keanu Reeves on the freeway. The only thing that keeps my nose going back to the grindstone is the realization that working with NodeJs would be worse. The problem is that the Kubernetes docs are pretty good. You copy-paste some hello world examples and the outputs look like they work. You start to get pretty good at using kubectl. You can see vague shapes and outlines in YAML. You’re starting to gain confidence that you might be able to do something useful.</p><p>“Let’s try to move our application into Kubernetes!” you yell into the air as you emerge dripping wet from your bathtub wrapped only in a towel, like <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-archimede/" title="Learn about the Archimedes fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Archimedes</a> sprinting through the streets of Syracuse. “We’ll just copy-paste some sections from here and here and put them there and there, and we’ll have our app running in no time,” you breathlessly explain to your coworkers. “Does it work?!” they excitedly ask. “Not yet. I mean, no. I need to indent the section and remove one piece that is not used in this spec. Then I need to decide if we use a deployment or a daemonset, but it’s almost there. I swear!”</p><p>First of all, put on some clothes. I’m all for taking a bath while thinking about kubernetes YAML files, but you need to get dressed afterward. Also, if you drop your Macbook Air into the bath with you, the results can be electrifying. I know. Second, here’s a riddle for you: how many YAML files do you think you need to run and deploy your application? Good thing that some people have ten fingers and ten toes because that’s probably how many you’ll need. And they’re all related but not really. You can copy-paste sections around if you’re adventurous and gullible, but you have no idea if the sections are compatible. There are only four required fields, all of which are gibberish, and everything goes under <code>spec:</code> (including <code>spec:</code>). Most of the sections are duplicated but only slightly. They vary microscopically in ways that matter macroscopically.</p><p>Copying and pasting is a wonderful art, and I’ve personally worked my entire adult career that way. I gleefully admit my whole output in life is like a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteNote" title="Example of a Ransome Note trope from movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ransom note</a> cut from stack overflow and documentation examples. But piecing together this fragile web of text to do what …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"> <blockquote><p>One luminary clock against the sky <br> Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p><p><cite>Robert Frost, <em>Acquainted with the Night</em> (1928)</cite></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Time is still the great mystery to us. It is no more than a&nbsp;concept; we don’t know if it even exists…</p><p><cite>Clifford D. Simak, <em>Shake­speare’s Planet</em> (1976)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Time is money, or so the saying goes. It follows that money is also time: a&nbsp;repre­sen­ta­tion of the collec­tive economic energy stored by humanity. However, the link between time and money is more intri­cate than it might seem at first. If money requires no time to create, it doesn’t work as money very well, or not for long. More profoundly, as we shall see, keeping track of things in the infor­ma­tional realm always implies keeping track of time.</p><p>As soon as money goes digital, we have to agree on a&nbsp;<em>defin­i­tion of time</em>, and herein lies the whole problem. You might think telling the time is as easy as glancing at whatever clock is nearby, and you would be right when it comes to everyday tasks. But when it comes to synchro­nizing the state of a&nbsp;global, adver­sarial, distrib­uted network, telling the time becomes an almost intractable problem. How do you tell the time if clocks can’t be trusted? How do you create the concept of a&nbsp;singular time if your system spans the galaxy? How do you measure time in a&nbsp;timeless realm? And what is time anyway?&nbsp;</p><p>To answer these questions, we will have to take a&nbsp;closer look at the concept of time itself and how Bitcoin makes up its own time: block time — more commonly known as <em>block height</em>. We will explore why the problem of timekeeping is intimately related to keeping records, why there is no absolute time in a&nbsp;decen­tral­ized system, and how Bitcoin uses causality and unpre­dictability to build its own sense of now.&nbsp;</p><p>Timekeeping devices have trans­formed civiliza­tions more than once. As Lewis Mumford pointed out in 1934: “The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern indus­trial age.” Today, it is again a&nbsp;timekeeping device that is trans­forming our civiliza­tion: a&nbsp;clock, not computers, is the true key-machine of the modern infor­ma­tional age. And this clock is Bitcoin.</p><h2 id="keeping-track-of-things">Keeping Track of Things</h2><blockquote><p>Let the child learn to count things, thus getting the notion of number. These things are, for the purpose of counting, consid­ered alike, and they may be single objects or groups.</p><p><cite>David Eugene Smith, <em>The Teaching of Elemen­tary Mathe­matics</em> (1900)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to keep track of things: physical tokens and ledgers. You can either use real-world artifacts directly, e.g., give someone a&nbsp;sea shell, a&nbsp;coin, or some other tangible <em>thing</em>, or you can repli­cate the state of the world by writing down what happened on a&nbsp;piece of paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine you are a&nbsp;shepherd and want to make sure that your whole flock returned home. You can put a&nbsp;collar on each sheep, and as soon as a&nbsp;sheep returns home, you simply remove the collar and hang it up in your shed. If you have one hanger for every collar, you will know that every sheep returned safely as soon as all hangers are filled. Of course, you can also count them and keep a&nbsp;list. However, you will have to make sure to create a&nbsp;new list every time you start counting, and you will also have to make sure not to count a&nbsp;single sheep twice (or not at all).</p><p>Money is essen­tially a&nbsp;tool to keep track of who owes what to whom. Broadly speaking, every­thing we have used as money up to now falls into two categories: <em>physical</em> artifacts and <em>infor­ma­tional</em> lists. Or, to use more common parlance: tokens and ledgers.</p><figure> <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2021-01-14-bitcoin-is-time/ledger-token.jpg"></figure><p>It is impor­tant to realize the inherent differ­ence of these categories, so let me point it out explic­itly: The first method — a&nbsp;physical token — <em>directly</em> repre­sents the state of things. The second one — a&nbsp;ledger — <em>indirectly</em> reflects the state of things. Each comes with advan­tages and disad­van­tages. For example, tokens are physical and distrib­uted; ledgers are infor­ma­tional and central­ized. Tokens are inher­ently trust­less; ledgers are not.</p><p>In the digital realm — no matter how intensely marketing gurus try to convince you of the opposite — we can only use ledgers. It is an <em>infor­ma­tional</em> realm, not a&nbsp;physical one. Even if you call a&nbsp;certain kind of infor­ma­tion a “token,” it is still a&nbsp;malleable piece of infor­ma­tion, written down on a&nbsp;hard drive or some other medium that can hold infor­ma­tion, effec­tively rendering it an infor­ma­tional record.</p><p>The ledger-like nature of all digital infor­ma­tion is the root cause of the double-spend problem. Infor­ma­tion never repre­sents the state of the world <em>directly</em>. Further, the movement of infor­ma­tion implies copying. Infor­ma­tion exists in one place, and to “move” it, you have to copy it to another place and erase it at its origin. This problem doesn’t exist in the physical realm. In the physical realm, we can actually move things from A&nbsp;to B. The infor­ma­tional realm doesn’t have this property. If you want to “move” infor­ma­tion from list A&nbsp;to list B, you have to copy it from A&nbsp;to B. There is no other way.</p><p>Another way to think about it is in terms of unique­ness. Physical tokens are unique compos­ites of atoms whose assembly is not easily replic­able. Pure infor­ma­tion does not have this property. If you can read the infor­ma­tion, you can also copy it perfectly. Practi­cally speaking, it follows that physical tokens are unique, and digital tokens are not. I&nbsp;would even argue that “digital token” is a&nbsp;misnomer. A&nbsp;token might repre­sent secret infor­ma­tion, but it will never repre­sent unique, singular, uncopy­able infor­ma­tion.</p><p>This differ­ence in proper­ties shows that there really is no way to “hand over” infor­ma­tion. It is impos­sible to pass on a&nbsp;digital token like you would pass on a&nbsp;physical one since you can never be sure if the original owner destroyed the infor­ma­tion on his end. Digital tokens, like all infor­ma­tion, can only be spread, like an idea.</p><blockquote><p>… if you have an apple and I&nbsp;have an apple, and we swap apples — we each end up with only one apple. But if you and I&nbsp;have an idea and we swap ideas — we each end up with two ideas.</p><p><cite>Charles F. Brannan (1949)</cite></p></blockquote><p>Physical tokens — what we call physical bearer assets, or “cash” — are free from this dilemma. In the real world, if you hand me a&nbsp;coin, your coin is gone. There is no magical dupli­ca­tion of the coin, and the only way to give it to me is to physi­cally hand it over. The laws of physics do not allow you to double-spend it.</p><p>While double-spending does exist in the non-digital realm — George Parker, a&nbsp;con artist who famously “double-spent” the Brooklyn Bridge and other landmarks comes to mind — it requires elabo­rate decep­tion and gullible buyers. Not so in the digital realm.&nbsp;</p><p>In the digital realm, because we are always dealing with <em>infor­ma­tion,</em> double-spending is an <em>inherent</em> problem. As everyone who ever copied a&nbsp;file or used copy-and-paste knows, infor­ma­tion is something that you can copy <em>perfectly</em>, and it is not bound to the medium that hosts it. If you have a&nbsp;digital photo­graph, for example, you can copy it a&nbsp;million times, store some copies on a&nbsp;USB stick, and send it to thousands of different people. Perfect copies are possible because infor­ma­tion allows for flawless error correc­tion, which elimi­nates degra­da­tion. And to top things off, there is virtu­ally no cost to dupli­ca­tion and no way to tell what the original was.</p><p>Again: when it comes to infor­ma­tion, copying is all there is. There simply is no way to <em>move</em> digital infor­ma­tion from A&nbsp;to B. Infor­ma­tion is always <em>copied</em> from A&nbsp;to B, and if the copying process was successful, the original copy of A&nbsp;is deleted. This is why the double-spending problem is so tricky. Absent of a&nbsp;central authority, there is no way to move <em>anything</em> from A&nbsp;to B&nbsp;in a&nbsp;trust­less manner. You always have to trust that the original will be deleted. A&nbsp;natural side-effect is that, when it comes to digital infor­ma­tion, it is <em>impos­sible</em> to tell how many copies are in existence and where these copies might be.</p><p>Because of this, using digital “tokens” as money can not and will never work. Since tokens derive their relia­bility from being hard to repro­duce as a&nbsp;result of their unique physical construc­tion, this advan­tage disap­pears in the digital realm. In the digital realm, tokens cannot be trusted. As a&nbsp;result of the nature of infor­ma­tion’s intrinsic proper­ties, the only viable format for digital money is not a&nbsp;token but a&nbsp;ledger — which brings us to the problem of time.</p><h2 id="tokens-are-timeless-ledgers-are-not">Tokens Are Timeless, Ledgers Are Not</h2><blockquote><p>For the things seen are tempo­rary, but the things unseen are everlasting.</p><p><cite>Paul of Tarsus, <em>Corinthians</em> 4:18b</cite></p></blockquote><p>When it comes to physical tokens, the time of a&nbsp;trans­ac­tion does not matter. You either have the coins in your pocket, or you don’t; you can either spend them, or you can’t. The simple act of posses­sion is the only prereq­ui­site for spending. The laws of nature take care of the rest. In that sense, physical tokens are trust­less and timeless.</p><p>When it comes to ledgers, physical posses­sion falls to the wayside. Whoever is in control of the ledger needs to make sure that things are <em>in order</em>. What is other­wise given by physical laws, namely that you can’t spend money that you don’t have and you can’t spend money that you have already spent previ­ously, has to be enforced by man-made rules. It is these rules that govern the orderly opera­tion and mainte­nance of a&nbsp;ledger, not physical laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving from physical laws to man-made rules is the crux of the matter. Man-made rules can be bent and broken, physical laws not so much. For example, you can’t simply “make up” a&nbsp;physical gold coin. You have to dig it out of the ground. You can, however, absolutely make up a&nbsp;gold coin on paper. To do this, you simply add an entry to the ledger and give yourself a&nbsp;couple of coins. Or, in the case of central banks, simply add a&nbsp;couple trillion with a&nbsp;few computer keystrokes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				
<p>In Part 1, <a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/2021/01/17/hacking-super-monkey-ball-part-1-banana-bunch-values/" data-type="post" data-id="645">we used Dolphin’s debugger to find the location of Player 1’s score in RAM</a>. In this article, our goal is to hack the score calculation routine so that the bonus goals do not award so many points.</p>



<p>Levels in Super Monkey Ball can have up to three separate exits: the normal Blue exit, a Green exit, and a Red exit. If you manage to get to a Green or Red exit, the game will let you skip a number of upcoming levels (e.g. skip the next 3 levels). In addition, it multiplies the score for completing the level by the number of levels skipped (e.g. you gain 3 times as many points as you would have with the normal exit). This is a totally bonkers amount of points, especially for levels which you can complete in only a few seconds and so also get the time bonus multiplier. In the below screenshot, the normal Blue exit would have awarded 3,386 points. Instead the game awards <em>130,158</em> points because I completed the level with the Red exit! There is some fun in a risk/reward calculation, but not when it’s this lopsided!</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png"><img loading="lazy" width="390" height="188" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7.png 390w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_7-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px"></a></figure>



<p>It really incentivizes you to skip levels, which means you play less of the game, which… sucks. If we eliminate the level skip bonus entirely, then it becomes a more interesting trade-off. You can either skip a few levels and so be less likely to lose lives but lose out on score, or you can choose to risk completing those levels and gain all the points from those levels you would have skipped. It’s a much more interesting mechanic than always choosing the Red exit to get that massive score dump.</p>



<p>So let’s start by finding the code that alters your score upon level completion. As in part 1, we set a memory watch breakpoint on Player 1’s score, then complete the level. As the score tally displays, Dolphin breaks and we have our score routine.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="635" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-1024x635.png 1024w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1-768x477.png 768w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_1.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s a couple interesting things to notice in this screenshot. First, you can see the current instruction is storing the updated score into our player’s struct, which is what we expected/hoped to find. Just before that is where it adds the new points into the existing score. You can see in <code>r4</code> and <code>r5</code> are the new score value to be added and the player’s current score, respectively. So this really looks like the routine we wanted to find. Finally, notice the <code>LR</code> value, which is where we jumped from to get into this routine. Let’s head to that code and see what called this routine. More specifically, we want to know where the beginning of this routine is, since we’ve paused execution somewhere in the middle of it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="102" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3.png 512w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_3-300x60.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></figure>



<p>That tells us where the score calculation routine actually begins. Let’s go see what happens there at the start of this function.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="469" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2.png 500w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_2-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></figure>



<p>Well that… sure is some PowerPC code. I can read assembly if I have to, but that looks like a real chore to try to understand. Notice the start of the routine is something like 500 bytes away from where the actual store happens. I don’t want to try to understand that much assembly.</p>



<p>Well luckily, just a few years ago the NSA (yes, that NSA) made their internal software reverse-engineering (SRE) tool <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Ghidra</a> public. Among many other things, it is capable of disassembling binaries into C source. I figured it probably was capable of handling PPC binaries (it is), but I wondered if anyone had specifically tried it with a GameCube binary. Turns out somebody had: I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hmapl.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/ghidra-a-potentially-useful-reverse-engineering-tool/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> about using a Ghidra plugin for the GameCube’s PPC variant to decompile Harvest Moon. I also found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/Ghidra-GameCube-Loader" target="_blank">a Ghidra plugin specifically for loading GameCube binaries</a> dumped from ISOs. It’s pretty painless to install. Once that’s done, you can use Dolphin to dump the game’s executable to disk, to load into Ghidra. Extract the game’s system data using Dolphin, and it will dump some binaries into a directory.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png"><img loading="lazy" width="823" height="751" src="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4.png 823w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-300x274.png 300w, https://www.smokingonabike.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/smb_blog2_4-768x701.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px"></a></figure>



<p>The one we’re interested in is main.dol, which is the game’s main executable. Loading that into Ghidra will prompt you to analyze the binary. On my machine, that only took about a minute to complete. Now I was ready to see if Ghidra could turn that PPC code into readable C code. So I jumped to the start of the score routine and…</p>

<p>It worked! Without any symbol names, the code is hard to read, but it’s legible enough. This was so exciting to see!! I’ve been wanting to hack this score code for at least a decade. And look at those if-statements! They’re comparing something against ‘<code>G</code>‘ and ‘<code>R</code>‘. Green and Red exits, perhaps? I couldn’t wait to figure out what this code was doing.</p>



<p>I’ve inserted the code in text format here, with some interesting lines highlighted for discussion below.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the raw code, you can see some interesting stuff. At [1] is our current PC, that <code>stw</code> instruction which we broke on back at the start of the article. You can see it’s adding the value of <code>uVar4</code> into the player’s score location. Scrolling up to [2], you see where <code>uVar4</code> is calculated, as the product of <code>iVar3</code> and <code>iVar6</code>. I bet one of those is the base score, and the other is the bonus multiplier. Going further up to [3], you’ll see <code>iVar3</code> does indeed seem to be derived from some global value. I bet that global is the current time, and these calculations are converting the internal time representation into points and maybe doing some rounding on the result. Looking around for more interesting stuff, the lines marked with [4] look a lot like bit flags. From the code flow, I bet that’s used for deciding which parts of the score calculation to display on screen when tallying the score.</p>



<p>So with some of those guesses, I used Ghidra to rename some of the local variables to be more descriptive. Here’s what I ended up with for everything that goes into calculating <code>uVar4</code> (I trimmed all the later stuff).</p>



<pre><code>  iVar2 = DAT_802f1f18;
  iVar4 = DAT_801eec4c;
  if ((param_1 &lt; 4) &amp;&amp; (1 &lt; param_1)) {
<strong><span>    score_multiplier = (int)DAT_801f3a7a; //[4]</span></strong>
    iVar5 = *(int *)(*(int *)(DAT_802f1f30 + 0xc) + 0x40);
    time_score = (DAT_801f3a74 * 100) / 0x3c + (DAT_801f3a74 * 100 &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    time_score = time_score - (time_score &gt;&gt; 0x1f);
    out_flags = 0;
    exit_data = iVar5;
    if (((DAT_801f3a64._0_2_ != 0) &amp;&amp; (exit_data = iVar5 + 0x14, DAT_801f3a64._0_2_ != 1)) &amp;&amp;
       (exit_data = iVar5 + 0x28, DAT_801f3a64._0_2_ != 2)) {
      exit_data = iVar5 + 0x3c;
    }
    if (*(char *)(exit_data + 0x12) == 'G') {
      out_flags = 4;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><h3>Modern JavaScript developers just got a new headless CMS at their disposal—and it’s one we think they’ll have an absolute blast working with. Payload—a self-hosted Node, Express and React-based headless CMS, is now available.</h3></p></div><p>Hi—my name is James and I’m one of the founders of Payload CMS. After two years of development and thousands of commits, I am extremely excited to announce that Payload CMS is now available to the public. It’s our response to the surprisingly sparse JavaScript CMS market and we hope that its arrival improves the development workflow of engineers all over the world.</p><p>Payload has already been put through the test with an array of pilot projects that ranged from video game backend to full e-commerce store development, virtual event platform, and more. Through the projects we’ve released with Payload thus far, our own team’s efficiency has absolutely skyrocketed and we’re confident that it’s only going to get better from here.</p><h5>Now, we’re finally ready to open up to the community.</h5><p>We would greatly appreciate if you were to install Payload, give it a shot, and let us know what you think. Any type of feedback is welcome - be it about how we write our docs, about your experience using Payload in your projects, or anything else!</p><p id="we-needed-a-cms-that-didnt-exist"><h2>We needed a CMS that didn’t exist</h2></p><p>We built Payload because, over the years, my team and I have come to understand exactly what we need out of a CMS to build projects—big or small—for our clients:</p><p id="1-self-hosted"><h3>1. Self-hosted.</h3></p><p>What happens when your hosted CMS doesn’t offer you just that <em>one</em> thing that you need, so you need to end up opening a REST endpoint to build it? Guess it’s time to maintain your own server or Lambda function. Seems like a racket when you could have just used a self-hosted CMS in the first place and had a server set up already. We’ve been there too many times to let that keep happening.</p><p>Third-party hosted CMS might work for simple sites where you know you’ll be able to work within their confines for the lifetime of the app, or for strictly delivering content and not ever having to worry about receiving content, but when your needs become any more advanced, a self-hosted CMS that provides you with complete control is the way to go.</p><p>Security is also a concern with third-party hosted CMS solutions. <a href="https://trbl.design/">My digital design firm TRBL</a> works with many clients that are heavily security-focused and want to maintain complete control over their databases and infrastructure. Many of them deploy their CMS within their own private networks—only accessible via VPN or similar. For these clients, maintaining control over their own code is an absolute necessity, which removes many popular third-party hosted CMS from the equation.</p><p>Find out how to install Payload by <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation">heading to our Docs</a>.</p><p id="2-customizable-react-admin-panel"><h3>2. Customizable React admin panel.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS’ admin panel to be minimal, understandable, and most of all, <strong>completely customizable</strong>. If we need to customize a field type, we should be able to swap in our own React field component to take the place of a default text input, for example. We definitely don’t want to jump through any hoops, either, like dealing with messy iFrames or separately developed field type packages.</p><p>If we want to add a view, we should be able to build a React component and add it as a view. If we want to be able to customize the CMS’ branding, and completely white-label the CMS, we should be able to.</p><div><p><img src="https://payloadcms.com/images/admin-laptop.png" alt="Payload headless CMS Admin UI built in React JS"></p><p>[Screenshot of the Payload Admin panel, editing a document from an Order collection]</p></div><p id="3-block-based-field-editor"><h3>3. Block-based field editor.</h3></p><p>My team and I design entire sites and apps with a component mentality—even down to how page layouts are assembled. Through UX design phases, we identify all the layout building “blocks” that are necessary to build and then we design our CMS to allow for content editors to self-craft their page layouts using the deliberately designed layout blocks that we’ve provided them with.  We then map each “block” in the CMS to React components that have props matching 1:1 to the fields within the CMS block. Boom, component-based layout building.</p><p>Like so many others, we started off years ago using WP and Advanced Custom Fields. ACF’s Flexible Content field type is great for layout building. But unfortunately, many other CMS have a complete lack of any layout-building workflow, and even when it’s supported, it lacks functionality or is a shoe-horned solution.</p><h5>Conditional Logic</h5><p>Another thing my team always took for granted in ACF that’s missing from other CMS completely is field-level conditional logic (show this field if another field has a value equal to <code>true</code> and similar). Our ideal CMS needs to have a built-in way to deliver dynamic interfaces that respond to input accordingly. Such a simple feature makes complex content management so much easier.</p><p id="4-javascript-top-to-bottom"><h3>4. JavaScript top to bottom.</h3></p><p>When’s the last time you worked on a web project without a <code>package.json</code>? Even if you work in PHP, you’re likely going to unavoidably need Node too. The idea of flattening our stack entirely into one language and not having to run a Docker container just to get a local LAMP environment going is a nice one indeed. We want to simplify our stack and keep it all JS. Better yet, TypeScript.</p><p id="5-reusable-secure-authentication"><h3>5. Reusable, secure authentication.</h3></p><p>One of the toughest parts about content management systems in-general is that they perform a lot of the lifting that a typical application framework would also need, but fall dramatically short of being able to call themselves an app framework through and through because of their lack of support for reusable authentication. For example, if you wanted to build a full SaaS product, you might need to create products, users, licenses, pages, and maybe even blog posts. Any run-of-the-mill CMS might get you close to being able to CRUD all of this stuff within its system, but what about user authentication? What about having control over users’ access? You’d be more often than not left to fend for yourself. Commonly you’d end up with either rolling your own system from scratch or building out a patchwork of separate systems (and separate admin UIs) to manage the product.</p><p>We need a CMS that comes with robust and reusable authentication right out of the box, so we can leverage the CMS for all our commonly needed authentication functionality. This way, we can keep all of our logic organized and build fully-featured apps right in our CMS that we’ve become accustomed to.</p><p>This way, if a client of ours comes to us asking for a simple app or a marketing site, but in the future, decides that they need to add full e-commerce support, we won’t end up with a messy disconnected set of admin UIs for them to manage their single product within. It can all be done in Payload.</p><h5>Payload's Authentication Operations</h5><p>In addition to just being able to log in and log out, Payload ships with everything a fully-featured app needs when it comes to authentication:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-registration</strong></li><li><strong>Login</strong></li><li><strong>Logout</strong></li><li><strong>Refresh token functionality</strong></li><li><strong>Forgot Password / Reset Password</strong></li><li><strong>Automatic locking of accounts on X number of failed password attempts</strong></li><li><strong>Email verification on new account creation</strong></li></ul><p>Payload supports as many authentication-ready collections as you need—meaning you could easily maintain a collection of Admins as well as a collection of Customers—each storing separate information and having separate access control to your documents.</p><h5>Payload's Access Control</h5><p>One of the best parts about Payload is its <a href="https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview">function-based Access Control</a>. Right in your configs, you define who can access what documents via extremely simple and straightforward Access Control functions.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example of an Orders collection with fine-tuned Access Control:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> Orders </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  access</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>create</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>read</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>          owner</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> equals</span><span>:</span><span> user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>update</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> user </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>delete</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="6-uploads-with-local-storage"><h3>6. Uploads with local storage.</h3></p><p>Other existing CMS provide integrations to third-party file storage solutions, but those come with an additional cost, and one more third-party dependency to maintain. We want to be able to store our own file uploads, in our own contexts. If we want to ship them off to AWS S3 or similar after they’re uploaded locally—then so be it. They should be our files first though. And uploading should be simple to configure.</p><p id="7-code-based"><h3>7. Code-based.</h3></p><p>We used the ACF GUI for a while, but then realized we could be much more deliberate if we stored our ACF configs right in the PHP of our site. It was super nice to have written them, understood the code, and have them checked in directly to our repositories. Having our schemas so close to our code made referencing them significantly easier. Nowadays, we don’t find value from GUI schema designers and would rather just write them in code, pending the syntax is concise enough.</p><p id="8-maintain-your-own-express-server"><h3>8. Maintain your own Express server.</h3></p><p>We want a CMS with the right level of abstraction. That means giving us the functionality we know we won’t ever need to change, like auth and file upload, while also giving us the freedom to do what we need to do unhindered by a big lumbering framework whose docs are written for people that have Ph.Ds in Computer Science.  If we could keep our hands on our own Express server, then we could do whatever we need to do however we need to do it, outside of the CMS. Plus, if we could keep our own Express server, we could combine a CMS with a SSR framework like NextJS if we wanted to. One command, spin up Next and the CMS at once.</p><p><strong>Here’s an example for how Payload ties in to your existing Express server:</strong></p><pre><div><p><span>const</span><span> payload </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'payload'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> express </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'express'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> app </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>express</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>payload</span><span>.</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  secret</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  mongoURL</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'mongodb://localhost/payload'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  express</span><span>:</span><span> app</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>app</span><span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>PORT</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>`</span><span>Application listening on </span><span>${</span><span>3000</span><span>}</span><span>...</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre><p id="9-localization-support"><h3>9.

Eventually, we may even become the go-to person on our team or in our organization, seen as the technical guru of our field.</p><p id="bd7c">At this level, we get a self-esteem boost, which is positive. But at times we may fall into the trap of getting an unnecessary ego. The wrong mindset creeps in, which can lead to the beginning of our downfall.</p><p id="8035">I’ve been through that journey. So I now consciously remind myself not to fall into one of those mindsets again. We’ll talk about three of them.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="fdb9">I once saw a tweet from a person who claimed his father (a programmer) offered to teach him how to code, and he rejected it. The author of the tweet is now a developer, describing himself as a self-taught programmer.</p><p id="e3c4">Programming isn’t a skill one can master completely by simply taking a course or getting a degree. A lot of sweat and time spent digging and learning is needed to build one’s competency.</p><p id="a45d">It’s not a field that can be effectively explored and fully discovered alone. We might not have a personal mentor and we may not have taken any formal courses, but that doesn’t change the fact that we still learn by reading from somewhere — whether that be a book, tutorial, blog, manual, or even Stack Overflow. All these things were written by someone.</p><p id="6607">In fact, the best way to learn programming is by working with a group of developers — through code reviews, pairings, constant discussion, and the exchange of ideas and the information learned. Attending conferences, guilds, dojos, etc. helps too.</p><p id="739c">Therefore, much of what we’ve learned and where we are today isn’t a result of our self-meditation on a mountain. Instead, it’s an accumulated assimilation of the knowledge and experience others have shared with us, either directly or indirectly.</p><p id="cc5a">We should always be grateful.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="0edf">Someone responded to one of my past blogs saying, “The young ones can’t concentrate. And their productivity is vastly lower than that of us oldsters. Their code quality is way lower.” I felt disgusted by this blanket statement targeting young programmers, even if I’m not the young one.</p><p id="c651">We learn, we grow, we age. With the advantage of time, we sometimes gain an upper hand in terms of both knowledge and experience in some area.</p><p id="10db">However, software development is an ever-changing field. One needs to continue learning to keep abreast of a skill. Over time, some of the past knowledge we acquired and spent time on is no longer relevant. When you consider what’s still relevant, the knowledge gap between older and younger programmers becomes smaller.</p><p id="15b7">At times, some area of knowledge younger programmers have might surpass us, the older folks (I consider myself an <em>older folk</em>, having worked for more than two decades). In software development, there’s been so much new knowledge to harvest in the last 10 years, and it’s not possible for us to extract it all.</p><p id="0b17">Never look down on the young ones. Respect each other, and always shamelessly ask and listen to their opinion. Be open. Avoid impostor syndrome. We might be surprised to learn a lot from those younger than us.</p><p id="28f9">The young ones are the future. They’ll shape the world one day. Teach them as much as you can, and also learn from them as much as you can. We’re not always right.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e916">“What more is there to learn within programming? Everything new is just an old thing with a different look — or it’s just <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>for</code> loops covered by fancier names and structures externally.” I thought this back then after I’ve mastered C++ and object-oriented programming.</p><p id="0a2f">I despised Java as an inferior language to C++ and looked down on all scripts — VBScript, JavaScript, and let’s not forget HTML, which isn’t even a language to me. Python, what is it? No <code>{}</code> and, it’s optional to use <code>;</code>? Using indentation is a must??</p><p id="f535">The word<em> evolve </em>meant nothing to me, and after a decade, Python became the most used language.</p><p id="1213">I still have the utmost respect for those with competency in C programming, having the ability to work with pointers, having proper memory management, and writing code that compiles into the smallest and most efficient executable.</p><p id="e21a">However, that’s no longer what mainstream software development looks like. Web programming took the world by storm in the ‘90s and early 2000s. Since the launch of the iPhone, mobile development has become a significant player in software development. And now artificial intelligence could be the next wave, which the Python language plays a significant role in enabling.</p><p id="11c4">Fast forward to today: Now I’m getting my feet wet in mobile development, a rapidly changing field. I just realized how wrong I was back then in despising the newer yet seemingly inferior product (i.e., Java) over what I’d mastered (i.e., C++). Java has influenced many of the programming languages we have today, and its JVM is the backbone of many new languages (e.g., Scala and Kotlin).</p><p id="97ef">Never despise newer tech at a glance. It’s true most of them spawn from an existing tech and may look similar (or at times even inferior), but all of these small little changes could contribute to the next leap of change.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="7126">In the early years of my career, I worked hard and was promoted fast. My boss jokingly gave me a little advice, “Don’t get cocky.” I guess that about sums it all up.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>In this article, we set up <em>limiters</em> in order to equitably distribute the bandwidth of our Internet connection among all the users of our local network.</p>



<h2>What are <em>Limiters</em>?</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a purpose.<br>A limiter can be used to limit traffic to a specific IP address or subnet, to limit traffic for a specific type of service (e.g. e-mail, web, …) or to distribute traffic equitably among several users.</p>



<p>Typical uses of limiters are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>limit the Internet bandwidth of user X to 1 Mbps ;</li><li>distribute equitably 10 Mbps of bandwidth between all the users of the “LAN” network;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the “OPT” network to a total of 5 Mbps;</li><li>limit the bandwidth of the FTP protocol to 2 Mbps.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Limiters allow to define a maximum bandwidth for a usage</strong>.<br>At the opposite, traffic shaping (like CBQ) allows to guarantee a minimum bandwidth.</p>



<h2>How limiters work?</h2>



<p>The implementation of the limiters is done in 2 steps:</p>



<ul><li>creating <strong>limiter</strong> itself: it’s a pipe with a maximum bandwidth which operates globally or by group of IP addresses;</li><li>creating assignment <strong>rules</strong>: which traffic will be limited by which pipe.</li></ul>



<p>Limiters are usually created in pairs: one limiter for incoming traffic (Download) and one limiter for outgoing traffic (Upload).</p>



<p>Limiters are organized hierarchically: a root limiter (also called a pipe), with a bandwidth and a latency, and on the other hand child limiters (called queues) with a weight (i.e. a priority).</p>



<h2>Use case: distribute Internet bandwidth equitably</h2>



<p>In this article we work with the following case study: we have an Internet connection with a download speed of 200 Mbps and an upload speed of 50 Mbps.<br>We want to share dynamically this bandwidth between all users.</p>



<p>If we have 2 users connected at the same time, they will each have 100 Mbps for download and 25 Mbps for upload at the maximum.<br>If we have 10 users connected at the same time, they will each have 20 Mbps for download and 5 Mbps for upload at the maximum.</p>



<p>pfSense will manage this equitable distribution automatically and dynamically as we go.</p>



<p>The network diagram is as follows:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="501" height="718" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya.png 501w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/network-diagram-lan-wan-pfsense-provya-209x300.png 209w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"><figcaption>Network diagram</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start the configuration!</p>



<h2>1. Create the upload <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We create 2 root limiters: one for upload and one for download.</p>

<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="156" height="238" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-traffic-shaper-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Traffic Shaper</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On the <strong>Limiters</strong> tab, click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the pipe and its queues.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the pipe (alphanumeric characters and underscore only). In our case, we call it “<strong>Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth</strong>: the bandwidth of the pipe. Note that we can define a bandwidth according to a schedule (“Schedule” option). In our case, we choose “50 Mbps”.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: this parameter allows to define how the limitation will be applied to the traffic. 3 choices are available:<ul><li><span>none</span>: the limitation will apply to all traffic as a single set. In our case, this is what we choose (we want the whole outgoing traffic to be limited to 50 Mbps).</li><li><span>Source addresses</span>: the limitation will apply per source IP address (or group of source IP addresses, depending on the mask). So, to perform a limitation by IP address of a network, we choose “Source addresses” and specify a /32 mask. This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Upload pipe.</li><li><span>Destination addresses</span>: the limitation will apply by destination IP address (or group of destination IP addresses, depending on the mask). This is the value we will choose when we will configure the queue of our Download pipe.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: allows to set advanced parameters such as latency or packet loss rate. These parameters are useful to simulate bad Internet connections (or to make a bad joke to a colleague…). We won’t use it in our case, but the name of each field speaks for itself.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="963" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x295.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiter-pipe-root-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x755.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At this point we have a pipe that will allow us to limit our traffic to a maximum bandwidth of 50 Mbps.</p>



<p>The next step is to create a queue linked to this pipe and specify that this queue will be applicable per user.</p>



<p>At the bottom of the page of the limiter we just created, we click on the “+ Add new Queue” button.</p>



<p>The items to be configured are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enable</strong>: check this box to enable the queue.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the queue. In our case, we call it “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>“.</li><li><strong>Mask</strong>: the mask to be applied. In our case, we choose “Source addresses”. We want to apply this limitation for each user, i.e. per source IP address, so we choose “32” as mask size.</li><li><strong>Description</strong>: description field, purely informative.</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: weight ranging from 1 (lowest priority) to 100 (highest priority). For a fair distribution of the bandwidth of the root limiter, this field can be left empty. If we want to give more bandwidth to some users than to others, then we have to play with this value. In our case, we leave the field empty (the distribution will be fair between users).</li><li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>: we leave these fields empty.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="802" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x246.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-upload-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x629.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Upload queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Our limiters (pipe and queue) are ready for outgoing (upload) traffic.</p>



<p>We still have to do the same configuration for incoming (download) traffic.</p>



<h2>2. Create the download <em>limiter</em></h2>



<p>We click on the “+ New Limiter” button.</p>



<p>The pipe configuration is the same as for the upload pipe.<br>You just have to think about choosing the right bandwidth (in our case, 200 Mbps) and changing its name (in our case, we call it “Download”).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="977" height="910" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 977w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x279.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pipe-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x715.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download pipe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As for the upload pipe, we create a queue: click on the button “+ Add new Queue”.</p>



<p>The configuration is almost the same as for the upload queue.<br>The difference is in the choice for the “Mask” option. Choose “Destination addresses”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="798" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 979w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x245.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/queue-limiter-download-configuration-pfsense-provya-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Download queue</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The limiters are created:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="146" height="123" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/limiters-list-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Limiters tree</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>3. Modify firewall rules</h2>



<p>The last step is to configure the firewall to associate traffic with limiters.</p>



<p>Navigate to Firewall &gt; Rules:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="160" height="241" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Choose the LAN tab and edit each filtering rule for Internet access.</p>



<p>On each rule, go to the advanced options (“Display Advanced” button):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="244" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png 405w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/advanced-options-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Advanced Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the bottom of the page, for the “In / Out pipe” option, choose “<strong>LAN_Upload</strong>” for the first drop-down list and “<strong>LAN_Download</strong>” for the second:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="126" src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya.png 791w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-300x48.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/firewall-limiter-rules-edit-pfsense-provya-768x122.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px"><figcaption>[pfSense] In / Out pipe (limiters)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is necessary to perform this manipulation on all the rules concerned.</p>



<p>The traffic limitation per user is in place!</p>



<h2>4. Check the service</h2>



<p>To check that the limiters are working properly, navigate to Diagnostics &gt; Limiter Info.<br>Each pipe and its queues is presented in text format with its parameters and values.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The if-statement is a very basic thing, not just in bash, but in all of programming.
I see them used quite a lot in shell scripts,
even though in many cases they can be replaced with something much more elegant.</p>
<p>In this rather short article, I'll show how control operators can be used
instead.
Many probably know about this, but don't realize how to use them nicely.
This will help you write cleaner shell scripts in the future.</p>
<p>Here is what a simple if-statements looks like in bash:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]
</span><span>then
    </span><span>command
</span><span>fi

</span><span># or
</span><span>if </span><span>[</span><span> expression </span><span>]; then </span><span>command</span><span>; fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>Ughh. Let's improve!</p>
<h2 id="control-operators">Control operators
    <a href="#control-operators" aria-label="Anchor link for: control-operators">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Bash provides <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Definitions.html#Definitions">control operators</a> to build sequences of
commands.
Some of these are conditional and allow logical branching based on the success
state of the last run command.</p>
<p>We will just focus on these two logical operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code>: the AND operator, run the following command only if previous succeeded</li>
<li><code>||</code>: the OR operator, run the following command only if previous failed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exit-codes">Exit codes
    <a href="#exit-codes" aria-label="Anchor link for: exit-codes">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>You might wonder how bash considers whether a command succeeded.
This is where <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status">exit codes</a> come in.
When a program exits a numeric status code is returned.
A value of <code>0</code> means the program succeeded, any other value means it failed.</p>
<p>The exit code is normally hidden.
The status of the last run command is stored in the <code>?</code> variable.
You may inspect it by invoking:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo </span><span>$</span><span>?
</span></code></pre>
<p>E.g., listing with <code>ls</code> normally returns <code>0</code>, but this value differs if the
directory doesn't exist or if an error occurred.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>ls ~</span><span>/            </span><span># exit code: 0
</span><span>ls </span><span>~</span><span>/nonexistent </span><span># exit code: 2
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will function similarly to almost any program.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-commands">Chaining commands
    <a href="#chaining-commands" aria-label="Anchor link for: chaining-commands">
        #
    </a>

</h2>
<p>Let's go over some examples to show how these control operators can be used.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Source_command">source</a> the <code>~/.profile</code> file, but only if it
is readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if </span><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>]</span><span>; then
    </span><span>source </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span><span>fi
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can simplify this using control operators:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>-r </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>. </span><span>~</span><span>/.profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>Only if the readability check expression is truthful/succeeds, we want to source
the file, so we use the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.</p>

<p>To require invoking user to be root, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>echo</code> command exists with <code>0</code>, so this propagates to <code>exit</code> if the
first expression is truthful.</p>

<p>If we'd like to print our profile file contents with a success message,
or an error message on reading failure, we can do the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cat ~</span><span>/.profile </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>echo</span><span> This is your profile </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Failed to read profile
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can make these command sequences as long as you want. Useful for
building install scripts that go through a series of steps. You could define
bash functions for each step and orchestrate the installation like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>cleanup </span><span>|| </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre>
<p>Or format it differently to make long sequences better readable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>init </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>configure </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>install </span><span>&amp;&amp;
  </span><span>cleanup </span><span>||
  </span><span>echo</span><span> Install failed
</span></code></pre><h2 id="nice-to-know">Nice to know

</h2>
<p>There are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/159514/61092">many</a> more control operators,
including list terminators, pipe operators, and others.</p>
<p>The <code>[</code> (commonly used in if-statements) isn't just a shell feature.
It is a binary on Unix-like systems, usually located at <code>/usr/bin/[</code>,
so it can be used anywhere.
It returns the exit code <code>0</code> if the expression was truthful.</p>
<p>You can chain multiple <code>[ expr ] &amp;&amp; [ expr ]</code> expressions together, they are
commands after all.</p>
<p>Bash also has <code>[[</code>, which is
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13542832/1000145">different</a> from <code>[</code>.</p>
<p>You can wrap multiple commands with <code>{ expr }</code> to run it as single expression in
your command chain. For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[ </span><span>$</span><span>EUID </span><span>-ne</span><span> 0 </span><span>] </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>{ </span><span>echo</span><span> You must be root</span><span>; </span><span>exit</span><span> 1 }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> commands do nothing more than returning <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Bash features <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion">parameter expression</a>.
You can use <code>${EDITOR:=nvim}</code> to set the <code>EDITOR</code> variable to <code>nvim</code> only if
it is empty, so you won't even need conditionals.</p>
<p>Most other shells support similar operators. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> uses <code>; and</code> and <code>; or</code>, but now <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4620">supports</a> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> as well in modern versions.</p>
<p><code>$_</code> (or <code>Alt+.</code>) is your last used argument (noted by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://lobste.rs/s/nao13f/elegant_bash_conditionals#c_brp038">@Diti</a>).
For example:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>test</span><span> -f </span><span>"</span><span>FILE</span><span>" </span><span>&amp;&amp; </span><span>source </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span>" </span><span>|| </span><span>echo </span><span>"$</span><span>_</span><span> does not exist</span><span>" </span><span>&gt;&amp;</span><span>2
</span></code></pre>
<p>A function or script returns the exit code of the last expression. If your last
expression is a command chain as described in this article, you might have an
unexpected exit code. See

</h2>
<p>These command sequences with control operators are an elegant alternative for
simple if-statements. I think they look much better and are more expressive
looking at conditional logic.</p>
<p>But, don't overuse them. For bigger statements or advanced branching, you should
fall back to if-statements.</p>
<p>I hope this article motivates you to make your shell scripts a little more
elegant in the future by using these operators.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2019-07-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2019-09-19</span>.</p>
<p>Frontend developers are pushing JavaScript as though the web could not function without it. The fact is that JavaScript is one of the top reasons for security breaches on the client computer and client mobile phones, it is a plague that turns privacy into a public exhibition, and it has paralyzed the industry in such a way that you can hardly find a website that doesn't display "the white screen of death" if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say it straight out: Frontend developers are breaking the Internet! They have been stricken with some kind of mass psychosis in which even the least amount of independent thinking has become so hard that you think you're dealing with a zombie. It doesn't even qualify as a form of blind following, because nobody is leading. It rather looks like everyone is running around frenzied.</p>
<p>If you're pushing JavaScript as a dependency for your website to function, you'd better be serving some pretty amazing and special content, otherwise your website is just plain broken!</p>
<p>I have worked as both backend and frontend developer since 1998 and I have never once made a web application depend upon JavaScript. This goes for web shops, blog systems, large CMS installations, as well as Intranet administration utilities, and much more. In situations where I have been hired as a consultant to an existing team, the first thing I have done was to remove any dependency on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Not once has a client ever experienced a problem with his web application as a result, rather on the contrary. Removing JavaScript makes the application load much faster, removes multiple security related attack vectors, and greatly improves customer privacy concerns and usability.</p>
<p>If you know what you're doing you can simulate much of the improved UI experience that JavaScript can provide using only backend technology. The much improved performance, security, and privacy far exceed whatever loss of JavaScript capabilities you might experience.</p>
<p>The problem resides with websites that by nature doesn't require any form of JavaScript in order to serve the content they are serving. And the fact of the matter is that the majority of frontend developers aren't developing applications for niche markets with specific JavaScript requirements, rather they are developing regular websites, applications that in the end are just plain simple HTML. You do remember what plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> is right?</p>
<p>Even most niche products that in nature perhaps do require some amount of JavaScript could often still be somewhat useful had they at least been build <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/opt_in">opt-in</a> rather than not function at all.</p>
<p>Also, have you ever seen how a blind person uses the Internet? If not you need to have this demonstrated! Especially if you're a frontend developer. You might think that blind people who use the Internet are a minority, but the fact of the matter is that it doesn't matter how many people with disabilities use the Internet, the Internet is for everybody, and when websites are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. Currently most websites are developed without the least concern for accessibility which makes them difficult or impossible for some people to use and the way JavaScript is being used is a very big part of that problem.</p>
<p>Websites that create barriers for people with disabilities are generally just badly designed. Making websites accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. And you, as a frontend developer, must understand that it is part of your responsibility to make sure that your web application contains as few barriers as possible. If you don't do that, then why are you doing frontend development in the first place?</p>
<p>Web development is not about how to make the work fast and easy for the "lazy" frontend developer who long since has forgotten how to manually do anything and as a result no longer knows or understands how to put a simple website together without the use of a barrier producing framework or technology.</p>
<p>The optimal solution will always be to make sure that basic functionality works without JavaScript.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is that more and more people disable JavaScript uncompromisingly, using extensions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoScript">NoScript</a>, due to very valid security concerns. If a website isn't working without JavaScript it is loosing potential visitors and customers on a regular basis. If you only use a JavaScript based statistics system, such as Googles Analytics, then you won't even see the problem. You need to look into the statistics running on the backend such as the webserver logs to see how many visitors that visit your website without JavaScript enabled.</p>
<p>Security issues from third party JavaScript widgets and JavaScript libraries are vulnerable aspects of JavaScript that is actively exploited on a massive scale. Security issues in browsers, such as <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-18/#CVE-2019-11707">CVE-2019-11707</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-19/">CVE-2019-11708</a>, are highly critical issues that are completely mitigated if JavaScript is disabled or removed completely. CVE-2019-11707 is a type confusion vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox that can result in an exploitable crash due to issues in Array.pop which can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects. CVE-2019-11708 is a sandbox escape vulnerability in Prompt:Open Inter-process communication (IPC) messages due to insufficient vetting of parameters. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a non-sandboxed parent process to open web content from a compromised child process using a specially crafted Prompt:Open IPC message between the child and parent process. Combining CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 can result <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">in arbitrary code execution</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript in the client is not a necessary evil. It is a tool that with great and meticulous care can improve the user experience to a certain degree in some unique situations, but if you are making your regular and non-unique web application depend upon JavaScript, then that is a clear sign that you are doing something very wrong.</p>
<p>Stop pushing JavaScript as a dependency just to make a regular and stupid website run!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-name="content">
<p><time>March 1, 2021</time></p><p>TL;DR: People are unlikely to make swift changes to their core behaviors. By
detecting what they care about now, you will get an accurate estimation of
their near future behavior. That helps you answer the second question you need
to ask during an interview: «Can I work with you?»</p>

<p>The previous behaviors will likely continue to manifest themselves. That is one
of the natural qualities of us humans. Like Newtonian objects, we stay in
motion when we are in motion and lay at rest when we are already at rest. To
change that, we have to exert a massive force and consciously apply it. If we
do it for a long enough time, new behaviors set in and become habits. But
without that effort, we usually continue being who we are. Perfectionists will
continue chasing the ideal state and delaying project deliveries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding">Cowboys</a>
will continue YOLOing untested solutions to production. In other words, the
matters people care about now are likely to govern their future behaviors.</p>

<p>That quality is both a challenge and a trait, depending on how you look at it.
If you want to change those behaviors in yourself, that is a challenge. If you
need to understand how a person would behave in a given context, that is a
valuable trait. And you can and should use this trait as a tool to learn more
about your candidates.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://autoiterative.com/blog/posts/what-to-ask-when-interviewing/">previous post</a>, we introduced a framework for hiring software
engineers.  It consists of three questions that you need to get sincere answers
to:
</p><ol>
<li>Can the candidate do the work?</li>
<li>Can I work with you?</li>
<li>Does the candidate want to work with me?</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to answer the first question is to let them do some actual work.
To answer the second one, assess their current behaviors and map them to your
company culture. This post explains in detail how to perform such an
assessment.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-work-with-you">Can I work with you?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, all you need to do is compare a candidate behavior to
your company culture.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate what we mean with a concrete case. At AutoIterative, we have
already pulled all the hard work of defining what our culture is. For example,
one of our core values at AutoIterative is «to do science instead of
cargo-culting.» That means that we always want to understand why we do
what we do. Whether ideas are ours or not, we are comfortable questioning and
challenging them. So how do we determine where the candidate stands in that
regard? Could we ask straight whether they are confident with challenging their
ideas? Sure, but that will not give us a rigorous assessment. Chances are, the
answer would be: «yes, of course, I am!» We do not want to measure
wishful thinking or imagination. The better question would be to ask a
candidate about the last time they had their ideas challenged. From their
answers, we can derive a more reliable estimation of their behavior.</p>

<p>Let us show how a typical conversation could unroll (along with our notes
explaining why do we ask what we ask):</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Tell me about a recent
case when someone challenged an idea that you introduced?

<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Once, I pushed for the idea
of adding monitoring to our service. It was roughly a year ago, and I got a lot
of pushback from my team.

</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer hints that the candidate cares about monitoring and metrics.
It is also helpful for analysis: it tells us how long ago that happened, it is
relevant, and it presents a situation. It is worth investigating in-depth, so
we decide to continue exploring it.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, what
happened? What was the pushback?
<span>(Note that we are using an open-ended
question here. We do not want our biases to influence their answers.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Well, we were having issues
in production at that moment. We were spending a lot of time reading logs,
trying to understand what was happening. Also, we were under pressure to
deliver a new feature. That could be the reason why people were not really
receptive to my idea when I proposed it. One of the engineers said that we have
no time for it now.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: The answer sheds even more light on the situation. First, it reveals
that the team was under pressure (a data point on how the candidate might
perform in such circumstances). Second, it shows that the candidate wanted to
improve the situation by investing in observability (this is great for us!). It
also tells us there was a conflict (a data point on how the candidate might
defuse them). Now we should dig into those individual aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Why did you want to add
metrics?
<span>(asking <i>why</i> will force the candidate
to explain their reasoning. That defines the task they had to do at the
moment.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: Because reading logs is not
the same as having metrics that you can query. Some visibility would have
improved the situation. I just wanted to understand the problem, fix it and
prevent us from getting into it in the future. We had to start somewhere, and
having those metrics would have provided a lot of value.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: This candidate demonstrates that they care about the runtime (a valuable
trait for us!). They opt to invest a bit today for a better future (again,
aligned with our values). If they care about those things in our company, we
would be happy to work with them. Now, let us dig into the conflict bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: Interesting, and how did
you handle the situation of your coworker saying a flat-out «no» to
your idea?
<span>(Note that here we exaggerate a bit what the
candidate said. Will they correct our impression? Will they confirm it and
elaborate more on how they saw the situation?)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I did not reply at the
exact time they said no. I did not want to provoke a conflict in front of
everyone during a standup meeting. It was not the first time I got a pushback
either. But we were all suffering, and I thought it was critical to add metrics
to our system to help us out of the situation. So after the meeting, I
approached my manager and explained the value we will get if we have metrics. I
asked for help pushing this forward.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: yes, this was an open conflict, and we need to drive the questions to
the resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Interviewer</span>: And what happened? How
did you present the idea to your manager?
<span>(Note the open-ended question again. It
pushes the candidate to explain <i>how</i> they behaved, allowing us to derive
the <i>why</i> behind that.)</span>
<br>
<span>Candidate</span>: I explained that we were
drowning in operational work and that we were blind. I learned in the SRE book
that measuring requests and latencies is one of the first steps to do.  <span>(Note: this could be cargo-culting. Let us make a
note, so we can later dig into their reasoning.)</span> I thought it made sense
to try it. I told my manager that I was ready to take ownership of the whole
process. Initially, I just wanted to add a couple of metrics as a proof of
concept and see if that improved our situation.  If it did, we would spend less
time debugging and more time working on features. He liked the idea, and we
started working on a plan to communicate to our team that I would start working
on it.
</blockquote>

<p>Notes: From their answers, we already have a clear definition of the action
that the candidate took. But there are more data points about the candidate.
They think about the team’s success (time spent working on a product instead of
debugging). They built a proof-of-concept to validate the idea before proposing
a full solution. They approached the manager asking for help instead of openly
arguing back. This behavior could hint at them being context-aware and a
team-player. They understood that the whole team is under stress caused by the
pressure to deliver.</p>

<p>The natural next step would be to push for closure and ask how the situation
ended. If you need more context, you can continue asking open-ended questions.
You will discover more details and get a more refined picture of a candidate’s
behavior. You can ask what the candidate learned from the situation and what
conclusions they drew from it. But let us wrap up the example here.</p>

<h2 id="the-conclusion">The conclusion</h2>

<p>As many of you probably realized, this is an interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOARA">SOARA</a>
techniques. The question explicitly asks for a story from the past, not for an
imaginary scenario. How a candidate replies to such an interview will yield a
lot of information and map to a behavior. Their answer will tell a story, and
their narrative will highlight what they value. From that, we would see what
their natural tendencies will be. And if you did your introspection and know
what your behaviors are, then comparing those two will answer whether you can
work together.</p>

<p>Note, however, that those techniques are not a silver bullet either. They will
not give you a 100% precise picture of a candidate out of a limited interview
time. No method will do that for you. But when applied correctly, they raise
your accuracy way above just the feelings. Focus on understanding and
thoroughly defining your culture. That will give you the exact dimensions along
which to measure your candidates. That, in turn, will provide a set of values
to assess. From them, you get an understanding of which questions are efficient
for you and which are not. Practice using the best ones, and you will answer
the second question with ease and precision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the AutoIterative platform will assess the candidate’s ability to do
the work.</p>

<h2 id="and-of-course-the-marketing-pitch">… and, of course, The Marketing Pitch™</h2>

<p>We solved the problem of software developer technical assessment. You no longer
need to resort to obscure rituals or torture them with the «Can you
reverse a linked list on a whiteboard?» (true story™) type of
questions. You no longer have to <i>*guess</i> whether the candidate can
deliver something that works. With the AutoIterative Production Challenges™,
you can instead just <i><em>test</em></i> that. And you can do it without investing a
single engineering hour before you know the answer.</p>

<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>
This paper describes a possible Internet service that
some major organization such as
Harvard University, AT&amp;T,
the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers,
the American Mathematical Society, the American Medical Association,
or even the Vatican, might offer: a home page "in perpetuity".
Such a "perpetual page" or "eternity page" or
"e-memorial page" would be a home page that the organization would
help the customer set up, with a guarantee that it would
last for (say) 500 years, or until the organization no
longer exists.
It would list all the things that the customer would like to
be remembered for (accomplishments, family, etc.).
As the population of the U.S. ages,
such a service should prove very popular.
After all, almost everyone wants to be remembered by posterity.
</p><center><h2> Details </h2></center>
<ul>
<li>
The name for this service needs to be chosen with care, and
of course registered. "Eternity service",
"Perpetual page", "Eternity page", "E-memorial page",
"Everlasting page"
are a few possibilities. I will use "Perpetual page"
in this paper.

The first version of this paper was written in
December 1996, although the idea for the "Perpetual home page"
first occurred to me in January 1996.
Not surprisingly,
it turns out that other people have had similar ideas, and there may be some
commercial services that provide electronic gravestones available even now.
But my vision is that
this service would be offered by a major organization or institute,
that has already existed for a long time and
has some chance of existing 500 years from now.
And I'm not thinking of tombstones, but home-pages.

</li>
<li>
The "Perpetual page" could include such things as:
<ul>
<li>
photographs of houses, boats, paintings, other precious possessions
</li>
<li>
lists of awards, accomplishments
</li>
<li>
writings, drawings, songs, even unpublished novels
(disk space is cheap)
</li>
<li>
links to perpetual pages of one's family (including ancestors!) and friends
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
This is the customer's chance to write their own
<em>New York Times</em> obituary page, or "time capsule".
(Many people do not realize that except for a handful of major obituaries,
every obituary item in the <em>New York Times</em> has to be
purchased at about $40 per line -- this can be a humiliating
experience for the next-of-kin.
Setting up a "Perpetual page" in advance for the sick
and elderly could be both therapeutic and comforting for the family.)

</li>
<li>
There should be a generous amount of disk
space available for each page - a minimum of ten megabytes,
to allow a number of photographs to be included. (Most Internet
providers at present do not allow nearly enough disk space.)
As my colleague 
Andrew Odlyzko has pointed out in his
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~amo/doc/tragic.loss.txt">
discussion of the future of scholarly journals</a>,
the cost of disk space is dropping so rapidly that it is likely that 
the cost of providing a service
in perpetuity will be not much more than that of providing it for
one year.

</li>
<li>
The organization would help the customer set up the initial page, and would
provide instructions on how to maintain it.
A "help desk" would be part of the service.

</li>
<li>
One way to structure the offer might be to tell customers:
For a one-time fee of $X, we will provide you with Y MB of
storage, and as long as you pay a small monthly fee,
you can keep modifying it.  Once you stop paying the monthly fee
(say because you die, or switch to a different
provider) we will keep the latest version <em>forever</em>.

</li>
<li>
Part of the offer would be a guarantee that when the Internet is replaced
by some other service in a few years, all the "Perpetual pages"
would be automatically converted to the new medium.

</li>
<li>
It is important that the organization offering the servce
should have been in existence for a long time, and have a good chance of
still existing 500 hundred years from now.
The organizations mentioned in the Abstract certainly
satisfy these conditions, and it is easy to think of others. 
Such a service would not carry much conviction
if offered by some tiny local Internet service provider.

</li>
<li>
This is the first time in history that such a thing is possible.

</li>
<li>
Incidentally,
the <em>New York Times</em>} for Saturday Dec. 7 1996 describes (on page D2)
a patent, US 5,517,791, for a new tombstone design that can
incorporate a person's life story - including photographs.
So ideas like the one I am proposing are "in the air".

</li>
<li>
As one may verify by visiting cemeteries in New Jersey, tombstones are rarely
legible after a hundred years have passed.  One of the advertisements for the
proposed service could show a family searching through a
cemetery full of grave stones that have been worn smooth,
looking for the lost grave of an ancestor.  Furthermore,
as the world population continues to explode,
cemeteries will become increasingly irrelevant.

</li>
<li>
The "perpetual page" service would especially appeal to mature customers.
There are several ways in which advertisements could point out the futility
of earlier attempts to be remembered, even by world leaders.
For example, one advertisement could show a replica of the original
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
after which all later mausoleums are named.
(See <em>The Oxford History of the Classical World</em>,
ed. J. Boardman et al., Oxford, 1993, p. 150.)
<center> <img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/maus1.jpg"> </center>
<p>
One of the Seven Wonders of the World, it was
built in the year 353 for King Mausolus of Caria by his wife.
It no longer exists.
"But if King Mausolus had had a perpetual page, we could still read
about his victories today ...".

</p></li>
<li>
An alternative way in which the "perpetual page" could be used is
by family and friends after the death of a loved one, by setting up a
permanent memorial for the deceased.  The Page would need to have an
authorized keeper, to screen out inappropriate material.
A certain amount of permanent space would be purchased, to which
interested parties could contribute in any way they wished.


</li>
<li>
Another advertisement could have a voice reading P. B. Shelley's
poem <strong>Ozymandias</strong>,
while the picture shows dust blowing around an appropriate ruin:

<pre>     I met a traveller from an antique land 
     Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
     Stand in the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
     Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
     And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
     Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
     Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
     The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
     And on the pedestal these words appear: 
     `My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
     Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' 
     Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
     Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
     The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</pre>
<center><img src="http://neilsloane.com/doc/ozy4.jpg"> </center>
</li>
<li>
It will also give all the unpublished poets and writers,
the unrecognized painters and musicians, the scientists
whose theories are rejected, the opportunity to have their
work immortalized.

</li>
<li>
Yet another advertisement could have Jessye Norman singing the moving
and unforgettable aria "Remember Me"
from Henry Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas".
(The formal title
is "Thy hand Belinda - when I am laid in Earth"
[Philips CD 434 161-2].)

</ul>

              <p>Hi from the team who built the "mesonet" weather station networks in the state of South Australia!</p>
              <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet">mesonet</a> is a term for a network of automated weather stations designed to monitor meteorological phenomena at high geographic density and updated frequently.</p>
              <p>We built these networks to help prevent pesticide <a href="#spraydrift">spray drift</a> - the phenomenon in which pesticide spray that is applied to a crop ends up drifting to other crops, sometimes many kilometres away.</p>
              <p>Spray drift can be a huge problem, as it can lead to damage or even destruction of highly valuable crops, and can also cause pollution to waterways and harm to native ecosystems.</p>
              <p>The biggest factor in spray drift the presence of a <a href="#thermalinversions">thermal inversion</a>, a state in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, which usually happens in the evening and overnight when the earth is cooling, but can happen at other times. However other meteorological phenomena also affect the likelihood of spray drift, and different types of spray respond differently.</p>
              <p>So we designed a <a href="#ourweatherstations">weather station</a> to measure all the relevant meteorological phenomena, and in particular to detect thermal inversions, and a custom <a href="#webapp">web app</a> to display the data in format that is very fast and simple to access and understand.</p>
              <p>We've now deployed 70 of these stations across two of the major agricultural regions of South Australia, and so far it seems to be making a difference: no damage due to spray drift has been reported in these regions since the networks were rolled out.</p>


              

              <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

              <p>A group of stakeholders in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North">Mid North region of South Australia</a> had identified spray drift as a major issue.</p>
              <p>The region, to the north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia">South Australia</a>'s capital of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, has a thriving agricultural sector, producing wheat, barley, wine grapes, pulses, livestock and other produce.</p>
              <p>The total annual output from the region is valued at nearly AUD $2 billion. It has been estimated that the potential loss in production from spray drift could be as high as $178M/year, and potential harm to waterways and native ecosystems is significant.</p>
              <p>The local stakeholders worked with meteorologists and researchers to develop a solution, then sought funding from the South Australia state government to fund the project.</p>
              <p>In 2018, a $1.4M grant was provided, and a pilot rollout of 40 weather stations was undertaken.  It was named the Mid North Mesonet.</p>
              <p>The pilot was deemed successful, and in 2019, another grant was provided by the state government for a network in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverland">Riverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Mallee">Mallee</a> region to the north-east of Adelaide.</p>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was rolled out, there have been no reported instances of crop damage due spray drift.</p>

              <a name="spraydrift"><h2>The Problem of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>Farmers spray pesticides on their crops to manage pests. It is an important feature of modern farming. Herbicide may be applied to target broad-leaf plants, other times to target summer weeds.</p>
              <p>Spray drift occurs when pesticide spray 'drifts' across into non-target areas.</p>
              <p>Spray drift is a problem because:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The affected non-target area may be particularly susceptible to pesticides (i.e. broad-leaf crops such as grapevines are especially vulnerable)</li>
                    <li>Some markets are highly sensitive to the amount of pesticide residues detectable in the end products (i.e. wine exports to China; organic farms; etc)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might be a sensitive natural ecosystem (i.e. local waterways)</li>
                    <li>The affected non-target area might include rain water tanks used for drinking water</li>
                    <li>It is a waste of pesticide product and labour time costs</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <a name="causesofspraydrift"><h2>Causes of Spray Drift</h2></a>
              <p>A combination of conditions can lead to spray drift.</p>
              <h3>Wind Speed</h3>
              <p>Wind speed that is very low or very high.</p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <p>A temperature over about 28°C (83°F).</p>
              <h3>Humidity</h3>
              <p>The effect of humidity varies depending on the type of spray. The spray manufacturer's instructions should provide guidance.</p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Stability</h3>
              <p><i>Unstable</i> or <i>stable</i> conditions can lead to spray drift. Conditions should be <i>neutral.</i></p>
              <h3>Thermal Inversions</h3>
              <p>A thermal inversion, in which temperature increases with increasing altitude, is a major risk factor for spray drift.</p>
              <p>Inversions generally happen in the evening and overnight as the earth cools, but they can happen at other times.</p>

              <a name="thermalinversions"><h2>Thermal Inversions</h2></a>
              <p>For current farming practices, long-distance spray drift generally occurs during very stable weather conditions (i.e. little to no air turbulence).</p>
              <p>A thermal inversion occurs when a warm layer of air sits above a cooler layer of air near the ground.</p>
              <p>This reduces air turbulence and can act as a ‘lid’ for an airborne pollutant source. The lack of air turbulence means the smaller spray droplets float without settling on the target crops.</p>
              <p>A very slight breeze can then carry these floating droplets large distances before they eventually descend into a non-target area.</p>
              <p>It is illegal to spray during a thermal inversion.</p>

              <p><strong>The problem: it is very difficult for farmers to tell if a thermal inversion is underway.</strong></p>

              <p>Our weather stations were designed to:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Measure temperature at 1.2m and 10m, in order to detect inversions</li>
                    <li>Measure all weather metrics that are relevant in determining whether it is safe to spray</li>
                    <li>Update data every 10 minutes, so farmers have access to the most recent readings</li>

              <a name="webapp"><h2>The Web Application</h2></a>

              <p>We initially used an off-the-shelf web application for displaying meteorological data, but soon realised we needed something tailored to our needs. We found a company that was already in the business of building web-applications to display environmental data for farmers, and they were willing to build a customised version for us.</p>

              <p>The key requirements for the application were:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each of the monitored metrics displayed on a map, with fast/simple switching between each metric</li>
                    <li>A dashboard of all the current key metrics and recent historical graphs</li>
                    <li>Long-term graphs of all the key metrics also available, and as well as the past 48 hours of data in tabular format</li>
                    <li>The site must display well and be easy to use on a mobile device, and be fast to use even in areas with low cellular signal strength, given that much of the usage will be by farmers out in the field in remote areas.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>The key technologies are:</p>
              <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Redis</li>
                    <li>Sidekiq for queue processing</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>Data is uploaded from the data logger via FTP (which may seem primitive, but the world of meteorological data still relies heavily on FTP).</p>

              <p>On detection of new data, the application first takes the most recent readings, and updates the data structures for the map and dashboard views.</p>

              <p>The historical data is then placed in a queue, for updating of historical graphs.</p>

              <p>All the data for the map view, dashboards and historical graphs are formatted into a JSON hash then serialized and stored in the Redis cache. That way, when the React web interface makes a request, the pre-formatted data can be retrieved and sent very quickly, as no querying, processing or formatting of data is required at request time.</p>

              <a name="results"><h2>Results so far</h2></a>

              <p>In the two years since the Mid North Mesonet was deployed, there have been no reported cases of crop damage due to spray drift.</p>

              <p>Damage and loss had been reported in most of the previous years - though not all. So it is too early to tell if the problem has been completely solved, but indications are promising.</p>

              <p>Other government bodies and NGOs are expressing interest in establishing their own mesonets.</p>

		<p>Yet another PDP-1 riddle, extended mode.</p>

		<p><span>Y</span>esterday, we solved the mystery of <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/nowgobang/2021/train-spotting-1">two well-known images</a>, formerly known as “The PDP-1 at the Tech Model Railroad Club”, with the help of the Hacker News community. — A triumph of shared knowledge.</p>
		<p>In 1971, the German artist Daniel Chodowiecki (1726 – 1801) commented his etching “Enlightenment” <em lang="de">(Aufklärung)</em> by the words, “However, if the sun only rises, mists do no harm.” <em lang="de">(Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.)</em> In real life, mists rise only to reveal another bank of fog. Which is the very process of research. — And this is certainly no exception. So this is a post about annother bank of fog, in the amazing form factor of a fully transitorized electronic contraption apt to manipulate 18-bit words in realtime according to a stored program and human interaction.</p>

Es wird auch wohl noch lange das schicklichste bleiben, wegen der Nebel, die immer aus Sümpfen, Rauchfässern und von neuen Brandopfern und Götzenaltären aufsteigen werden, die sie leicht verdecken können. Indessen wenn die Sonne nur aufgeht, so schaden Nebel nichts.”</p>

		<h2>Another PDP-1B Prototype?</h2>
		<p><span>Y</span>esterday’s sunrise, <em>um,</em> success was the indentification of the scene of a series of images showing a somewhat rudimentary front part of a DEC PDP-1 and a Type 30 Visual CRT display next to a model railway layout. And we proceeded to conclude that this was a PDP-1 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, operated by the Program Head of the CS program, J.A.N. Lee (probably around 1970).</p>

		</figure>

		<p>However, this also posed a new riddle, as at least two sources referred to this machine as a PDP-1B. Namely, the history page of the UMass Amherst CS program’ website,</p>
		<blockquote>
		The PDP-lB of those early days was soon replaced by three PDP-11s and a PDP-l5 with a graphics system.

		</blockquote>
		<p>and the title of another photo of the same series (or lot) in the collection of the Computer History Museum (CHM), which isn’t available as a digitized image,</p>

		</blockquote>

		<p>Following established knowledge, there was a single PDP-1A prototype, followed by two PDP-1B pre-production prototypes (one going to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL, the other to BBN) and the production models PDP-1C and PDP-1D, the latter being the enhanced time-sharing model. Further, the two pre-production prototypes had a 4-cabinets main unit, which was repackaged for a more cost effective and reliable 3-cabinets design, and finally to a 4-cabinets design allowing for dedicated space for expansion modules for the production models. This history leaves no apparent room for a PDP-1B at Amherst. So is this an error in these attributions, maybe referring to a common source as a single point of failure, or is there more to this?</p>
		<p>Update: Gordon Bell et al. mention a third PDP-1 prototype in <a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/_Books/Bell-ComputerEngineering.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="PDF">Computer Engineering. A DEC View of Hardware System Design</a> (Digital Press, Maynard, MA, 1978): <em>“A third machine, similar to the 1/A and 1/B, was constructed for internal use.”</em> (pp. 136, 137)</p>

		<h2>PDP-1 Lineage</h2>
		<h3>All-White PDP-1s</h3>
		<p>The first prototype, PDP-1A, was an all white machine, featuring an integrated control desk with built-in CRT and operator’s console, a three-cabinet packaging of the main unit, and a Friden Flexowriter as a console typewriter. This machine was presented at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959.</p>

		</figure>

		<p>The same machine (and the same image) also appeared in the initial announcement in Datamation, November/December issue 1959:</p>

		</figure>

		<p>Then, there is a white 4-cabinets machine seen in early DEC materials, here from a brochure from March 1961. This all-white machine features a 4-cabinets main unit, a detached control console with black print and the early DEC logo (more on this later), a CRT display in similar hexagonal housing as later Type 30 CRTs, but mounted on a narrower, single-unit stand, and a Soroban console typewriter (a modified IBM Model A):</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Apparently, we see this machine again at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), in an image in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> by David Walden and Raymond Nickerson (ed.), 2010; page 51:</p>

		</figure>
		<p>The following, rather blurry image from <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/08/102740407-05-01-acc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Digital Equipment Corporation – Nineteen Fifty-Seven to the Present”</a> (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, MA, 1972; p.3) seems to show the same machine (all white, 4 cabinets, detached console), but with a different CRT with the standard double-unit display stand. Notably, the paper-tape devices on the left and the chairs look much like the one the BBN image, hinting at the photo showing the same installation.</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>
		<p>The same configuration appears in yet another photo (from the “DIGITAL Computing Timeline”), here, explicitely tagged as <em>“The PDP-1 operating system, the world's first timesharing system, is written by engineers at MIT and BBN for the PDP-1. (…) Shown here is the PDP-1 installation at BBN.”:</em></p>

		</figure>

		<p>At this point it may be fair to assume that the images of the white PDP-1B, found in early DEC brochures, are actually depicting the BBN PDP-1B.</p>

		<p>The last image (to my humble knowledge) in this lineage of all-white PDP-1s featuring a detached console seems to be an early production PDP-1 in 3-cabinets packaging at Itek (allegedly the second production machine):</p>
		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>Something, all these all-white machines with a detached console have in common, is that they are lacking an integrated paper-tape unit. In these images, we see a separate generic paper-tape unit associated to the machine, usually to the left of the control console. DEC even envisioned the tape unit as a detached desk appliance, much like the control console:</p>

		<p>Here’s a short history of this strand of PDP-1s, as comprehensively told in <a href="http://www.walden-family.com/bbn/bbn-print2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“A Culture of Innovation – Insider Accounts of Computing and Life at BBN”</a> (ibidem, pp. 53–55):</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>The Eastern Joint Computer Conference was in Boston in December 1959, and there Fredkin saw the PDP-1 and “realized it was fantastic.”
		The project to design and build the PDP-1 had started just four months prior to that. Ben Gurley was the designer, and he also built the computer with the help of one engineering assistant.</p>
		<p>“So,” says Fredkin, “I convinced BBN to become Digital’s first customer for the PDP-1. We arranged to borrow the prototype PDP-1 while Digital built the first ‘production’ version.” The prototype machine (a PDP model 1a) was delivered to BBN in early 1960.
		At the time, according to Fredkin, Digital had the idea that a computer manufacturer shouldn’t do software. Thus, Fredkin wrote the assembler for the machine, wrote utility routines (like a rudimentary operating system), and so forth. In that era programs were typically written on ruled sheets with columns for the various fixed-length instruction fields. Ed’s assembler for the PDP-1 was called FRAP, which stood for “free of rules assembly program” and which allowed variable-length instructions. At some point Fredkin also wrote light pen software for the machine.</p>
		<p>Eventually the first production model PDP-1, a PDP model 1b system (serial number 2), arrived at BBN. That was Digital’s first PDP-1 sale. Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>When the PDP-1b arrived, BBN had a ceremony with a lot of hoopla. I wrote a little program so that the PDP-1b could cut its own ribbon at a ribbon-cutting ceremony (appropriate since one of the ideas was for the PDP-1 to interact with the real world). Digital founder Ken Olsen was present.</p>
		<p>Bill Fletcher also was working with Fredkin on the PDP-1b. (…)</p>
		<p><strong>PDP-1b Time-Sharing: the Research Computer System</strong></p>
		<p>Fredkin says that he had the idea of hiring John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. This soon led to plans to develop a time-sharing system for the PDP-1. McCarthy had the idea of time-sharing, and Fredkin saw the potential for time-sharing on the PDP-1. (…) Fredkin says,</p>
		<p>John’s invention of time-sharing and his telling me about his ideas all occurred before the PDP-1 existed. When I first saw the PDP-1 at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference, I realized that it was the perfect low-cost vehicle for implementing John’s ideas. That is why I specified that several of the modifications for time …</p></blockquote></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Update: There’s a <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/is-domain-driven-design-overrated/">slightly extended version of this post</a> over at the INNOQ company blog.</em></p>
<p>There, I said it. Now that I have your attention: Domain Driven Design (DDD) has recently gained additional popularity, as evidenced by new books, conference talks (and even complete conferences dedicated to it), and lots of trainings – including some by our very own colleagues at <a href="https://www.innoq.com/">INNOQ</a>. And in contrast to my click-bait headline, I’m actually a fan. <a href="https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">Eric Evans’s book</a>, the additional work writing and evangelizing it done by <a href="https://vaughnvernon.com/">Vaughn Vernon</a> (e.g. in <a href="https://www.case-podcast.org/15-domain-driven-design-with-vaughn-vernon">this very good podcast</a> with my colleague Joy) and many others, are all very good additions to our industry’s body of knowledge. In the best sense of pattern languages, DDD gives clear names to things that many developers and designers know how to do, but cannot reliably and compatibly communicate about.</p>
<p>But I’m annoyed by the fact that recently, it seems that any time somebody talks about how to architect system or service boundaries, or even just mentions non-technical design, everybody feels compelled to bring in the DDD experts – as if they were the only superheroes who could possibly design anything at all. This is just as bad as any other situation where you blindly apply the solution that’s currently en vogue, just because it is the thing everyone talks about, and not because it is the right solution for the job. DDD is great, but it’s just one of many tools and techniques you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I think there is a more important aspect that people miss, especially when they get into DDD as their introduction to design in general. DDD emphasizes the importance of naming, and it suggests you should strive for a common, ubiquitous language, in the context you’re designing for. But it also uses its own language – concepts like bounded context, aggregates, entities, value objects, etc. – for our domain, the domain of designing systems. And while these are all well and good, they’re only one possible language. There’s value in calling a value object a value object, if this is a term many people understand, to facilitate communication. But the existing, common DDD concepts are not the only concepts you should consider – they are just examples of a very common trait of designing and architecting systems: Coming up with and recognizing patterns, giving them good names, and using them to give the system structure and integrity. If in your architecture, there’s a common pattern that you use a Filter to route requests to a Handler, or a concept of a Document that is handled by an Agent, then these things may occur again and again, on the same level as Services or Repositories, and end up being way more important to you. This is fine! This concept, that we can and should invent our own languages, is to me way more important than many naïve DDD practitioners think. I like to believe that DDD experts know this very well, and view any DDD material as a starting point, not an end result – but if all you’re doing is applying the by-the-book definition of existing DDD terms, and trying to shoe-horn any problem into this existing structure, yours is a very sad designer’s life.</p>
<p>There is a life beyond DDD. Not every good design needs to be Domain-Driven (though I can accept it should always be driven by the domain, just not necessarily in the DDD sense). You can design good systems even if you’re not a DDD expert.</p>

<p>Do you remember your first time using a modern smartphone? A vibrant screen that responded instantly when you tapped replaced cramped keyboards. You could sign your name, drag and drop apps around the screen, and even spin the giant Price is Right wheel to set your alarm. In 2007, this felt like a the future. There's a reason it was called 'the Jesus phone.'</p>
<p>At that same time, The Motorola Razr (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_IK295sfxQ">video</a>) was the top phone on the market. It was a flip phone with the ability to take photos, play videos, browse the web, and play music. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK7FvGz4Jkc">video</a>) even had a touch screen.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/smartphones-2007.png">
<p>The difference was <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>When you touched a Razr or a Palm phone, there was a delay. It felt sluggish and slow. Apple removed the delay between your finger tapping the screen and something happening. Your finger could finally manipulate the UI in realtime, just like in the real world. It felt magical. If there was even a slight delay, the whole experience fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Speed is a killer feature. Speed is a differentiator.</strong></p>
<p>Yet teams consistently overlook speed. Instead, they add more features (which ironically make things slower). Products bloat over time and performance goes downhill.</p>
<p>New features might help your users accomplish something extra in your product.
<strong>Latency stops your users from doing the job they already hire your product for.</strong></p>
<p>Slow ui acts like tiny papercuts. Every time we have to wait, we get impatient, frustrated, and lose our flow.</p>
<h2>Honestly assess your speed</h2>
<p>I want you to take a moment and approach your product with a fresh set of eyes: Eyes for speed  👀</p>
<p>Go through your onboarding flow and try your core product features. Take mental note of how long each step takes to appear on the page then to be interactive.</p>
<p>How slow is it?
Be honest.
It’s ok, I’ve been there too.</p>
<p>Does your checkout page take 10+ seconds to load? Did you have to wait for a loading indicator multiple times along the way? Did things look interactive but weren’t loaded yet?</p>
<p>Every one of these is an opportunity. The great thing about speed (also called ‘performance’) is that you can stack rank it and burn it down.</p>
<p>Imagine what your product would feel like if everything happened in real time.</p>
<p><img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/speed-keanu-sandra.png"></p><p>Be like Keanu and fix every slowdown in your product. Your users will thank you.</p>
<h2>Places where speed matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speed during Checkout - Every second of page load time kills conversion rates. A 1 second delay <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/">reduces conversion rate by 7%</a>.</li>
<li>Framerate in Virtual Reality - The early days of Virtual Reality caused intense nausea akin to motion sickness <a href="https://link.medium.com/QyheLe9rbeb">when framerates dropped below 60fps</a>.</li>
<li>Design Tools - Users are consistently frustrated when Sketch or Figma are slow. <a href="https://quizlet.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-design">Designers have high APM</a> (actions per minute) and a small slowdown can occur 5-10 times per minute.</li>
<li>The core interaction of your product - Your product exists to save people time or help them solve a problem. Introducing friction or delay during the most important flow of your product will drive people crazy. Notion has developed a reputation for being a sluggish product:</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/speed-is-the-killer-feature/reddit-notion.png">
<h2>Perception vs. Reality</h2>
<p>If you can’t speed up a specific action, you can often fake it. Perceived speed is just as important as actual speed. Even if you can’t be fast, you should appear to be fast.</p>
<p><strong>Large content</strong> - Render the screen while content loads so the user knows what’s coming.
<strong>Long load times</strong> - Make the screen interactive, even if everything hasn’t loaded.
<strong>Waiting for an action</strong> - Allow the user to take the action and keep moving but post the action in the background.
<strong>Very long actions</strong> - If you have an action that will take 30s or more, offer to notify the user (e.g. via email) when the action is available.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of products that fake being fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook’s app pioneered loading images that look like actual content. The structure and UI of the page loads but the content does not. As a result, you can still use the product and prepare to take actions, even if the content hasn’t loaded.</li>
<li>Games have a rule to never block the input thread. You can slow down the visuals but the controls should always feel responsive so the user feels in control.</li>
<li>Robinhood has you swipe up to trade, but runs your transaction in the background and notifies you via email when your trade is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When is it ok to be slow?</h2>
<ul>
<li>When there is a physical constraint that causes things to take a while (e.g. dispensing money from an ATM)</li>
<li>When you want to give people a chance to correct a mistake (e.g. Gmail's "undo" feature)</li>
<li>When a human has to keep up with a machine (e.g. we slow down video game framerates, otherwise the game would run at 60x speed and overwhelm you).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonus Fun: What would it be like to live with lag?</h2>
<p>Imagine making breakfast with a 1 second latency added to every action you take. Even something as simple as moving your hands so that an egg rests over a bowl becomes incredibly challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a real life experiment where 0.5-3s of latency was added to everyone's action via a VR headset:</strong></p>

<p>This is what we're forcing on people when we ship laggy software. We're making them spend their time waiting for us.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
      
      <div><p>We’ve launched a brand new version of Element, called <a href="https://element.io/element-home">Element Home</a>!<br></p><p>It’s the Element app, but faster, personalised and under your control - all packaged up so you don’t have to worry about how it works! You can just enjoy the fact you know you chose someone you trust (us!) with your data.<br></p><p>So that you know, here’s what’s going on behind the scenes with Element Home; in practice you’re getting your own fully managed, dedicated server alongside your Element app. It means you have a notably faster service than when using a typical free public server - you’re saved the hassle of self-hosting and it’s guaranteed to be kept updated with the very latest and greatest Matrix hosting best practices.<br></p><div><p>On top of faster messaging, Element Home comes with five user accounts. It’s the ideal way for a family, or groups of friends, to get a super-quick professionally hosted version of Element.</p><p><strong>A new type of messenger</strong></p></div><p>As you know, Element is completely different to most messaging apps. <br></p><p>Because Element is <strong>decentralised</strong>, the app itself (what you see) is separate from the Matrix hosting service behind it (what you don’t see; the movement of messages and where they are stored).<br></p><p>That’s important because it lets users decide where their messages and data are kept. In owning that choice, you also get to own your data and messages rather than having them sucked up into the likes of Facebook Messenger, Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp.<br></p><p>Some people choose to host themselves, and that’s great. As it requires some technical knowledge, many others choose to use a free public hosting service such as Matrix.org to get up and running.<br></p><p>Element Home is a third option; the ability to pay for a fully managed, dedicated server (aka a ‘homeserver’). Being a dedicated server, it devotes itself to just a handful of users; and that’s why it’s so much quicker than a typical free public server that constantly juggles thousands of users.</p><p><strong>There are many messaging apps, but surprisingly little choice.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Comparison-table-8--1-.png 2108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Element compared with centralised messaging apps.</figcaption></figure><p><br><strong>Free vs $10 per month</strong><br></p><p>As you know, Element and Matrix is all about giving you choice. If you want to use the free version, that’s completely fine by us!<br></p><p>But here’s the extra you get in return for a few bucks a month:<br></p><ol><li>Element Home means you’re <strong>hosted by Element Matrix Services</strong> - our Matrix-based hosting platform used by big companies and public sector organisations. You have a <strong>dedicated server</strong> (so you’re sharing minimal infrastructure with anyone else), fully managed and maintained by the most Matrix-savvy team in the world.<br></li><li>Professional-hosting means the service is <strong>notably faster</strong> than when hosted by a typical free public server, and <strong>always fully updated</strong> and maintained.<br></li><li>An Element domain that you can name, so you can make <strong>memorable Matrix IDs</strong> such as @yourfirstname:yoursurname.ems.host. Use your surname as the domain, and it’s perfect for family sharing!<br></li><li><strong>Five Element accounts</strong> - so after using one yourself, you’ll have four more for family or friends - so that’s <strong>just $2 per user per month</strong> for a super-quick data sovereign messaging service (you can add more users if you wish).</li></ol><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/Element-Home-custom-IDs.png 848w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Matching IDs for all the family!</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wishing you could turn back time?!</strong></p><p>If you’re an Element user and you’re self-hosting, or using a typical free public server (such as Matrix.org), you can simply copy your existing account over to Element Home. Currently, you can only do this in the Element web app (we’re working on an equally simple upgrade from within Android and iOS). Once you’ve upgraded your ‘old’ account will still be live, so feel free to keep it or delete it as you see fit.<br></p><p>For those not already up and running on Element, just <a href="https://element.io/element-home">sign up for Element Home</a> from here.</p></div>

<![CDATA[How to Read Assembly Language]]>

March 1, 2021 | https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Why, in 2021, does anyone need to learn about assembly language?
First, reading assembly language is the way to know <em>exactly</em> what
your program is doing. Why, <em>exactly</em>, is that C++ program 1 MiB (say)
instead of 100 KiB? Is it possible to squeeze some more performance
out of that function that gets called all the time?</p><p>For C++ in particular, it is easy to forget or just not notice some
operation (e.g., an implicit conversion or a call to a copy
constructor or destructor) that is implied by the source code and
language semantics, but not spelled out explicitly. Looking at the
assembly generated by the compiler puts everything in plain sight.</p><p>Second, the more practical reason: so far, posts on this blog haven’t
required an understanding of assembly language, despite constant
links to <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a>. By <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottWolchok/status/1361022423399755776">popular
demand</a>,
however, our next topic will be parameter passing, and for that, we
will need a basic understanding of assembly language. We will focus
only on <em>reading</em> assembly language, not writing it.</p><p>The basic unit of assembly language is the <strong>instruction</strong>. Each
machine instruction is a small operation, like adding two numbers,
loading some data from memory, jumping to another memory location
(like the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto">goto</a>
statement), or calling or returning from a function. (The x86
architecture has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">lots of not-so-small
instructions</a>
as well. Some of these are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5959890/enter-vs-push-ebp-mov-ebp-esp-sub-esp-imm-and-leave-vs-mov-esp-ebp">legacy
cruft</a>
built up over the 40-odd years of the architecture’s existence, and
others are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">newfangled
additions</a>. )</p><p>Our first toy example will get us acquainted with simple
instructions. It just calculates the square of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm">norm</a>
of a 2D vector:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and here is the resulting x86_64 assembly from clang 11, <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tQVvQAZPLUwA5YwCNMxEADZSAB1QLC62nsMTQS8fNTorG3sjJxd3JRUw2gYCZmICAONTTkVlTFU/ZNSCCLtHZzdFFLSMoOyFKuLrUujy1wBKRVQDYmQOAHIpAGZrZEMsAGpxQZ1kevx6KexxAAYAQRXV%2BuIDVXGANTzJSYB2WTXxi/HrAlduAH0CcYAPKbPVy6v6W4fxgE9XjbiY4AEQBaw212%2Bj1oJCMDAAjgZUph0BADsgjgA3NonN4fYiYAjdWjjTEAOie4wAVKSKZMZLTftTGWD1iC%2Bh1WCA%2BgBWPqkUx9Zb81DcnRyOTjBRdHqYemDTj8gjc4VtDoAaxAg0GZO1ev1BvcXL63H5guFpFFfX5ChAy1IyqFHNIcFgSDQRg8eHYZAoEA9Xp9KGEok4nGW2So3oIzltEAcKv5DmsqV%2B3MVpA9Ri0BAA8rRWGmnaQsEYRMB2ImS3gCflMZhbcXME88gYY%2Bn%2BddlB2hHgHMRU3osD2CMQ8EYOx0aPQmGwODx%2BIIQ2IJTJew5bZAOqgPIlGwBaXODcb7uZTYESGRySQW%2BJ5RKabQ1LKkcwlKIxYLeXx0Z9f0J%2BO%2BZQuHUuT5HQhTVPomSCHe4FJA0QEtCBlRFH%2BdSIU0H7lJwHTSt0vRcJy3J8gKVZWk8AAcrj7rc4yjOW4xhmSyxkpw4wQLghAkPK2TjHonres4vE4uKV4yEqiZqqQmrarqBoKdqRrcqaZHFlaNp2g6UkujAiAoKggk%2BuQlABkJLgMaG4aRtGsaUAmxbJrQqY9lmOb5oWValuWlbFvgtZqPWjYWs2rbtn0GZdsaFqsH2A7EL8Q79Bao7jpOpDTowLCVguAiSEI5YoKu8ixRu8DbrufgHkeJ5noMF7FTeNpgQ%2BEDmOhr7aEhn7ZCEP7%2BNBtSeN%2BiTdThOQJAUDQdXBiSQY0kTAbB02DS%2B9RFGNIF4TKhG4UIJFmuR3JUTRdGWcATGcCxbEcVxRDELxpD8YZgbCUMkiicVklOtJsk6opin7Sah3qdymn2o6qrEX0kggxaGnaT9HT1sQPgaNwQA%3D%3D">via Compiler Explorer</a>:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>imulq</span>   %rdi, %rdi
        <span>imulq</span>   %rsi, %rsi
        <span>leaq</span>    (%rsi,%rdi), %rax
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s talk about that first instruction: <code>imulq %rdi, %rdi</code>. This
instruction <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul">performs signed integer
multiplication</a>. The <code>q</code>
suffix tells us that it is operating on 64-bit quantities. (In
contrast, <code>l</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>b</code> would denote 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit,
respectively.) It multiplies the value in the first given register
(<code>rdi</code>; register names are prefixed with a <code>%</code> sign) by the value in
the second register and stores the result in that second
register. This is squaring <code>v.x</code> in our example C++ code.</p><p>The second instruction does the same with the value in <code>%rsi</code>, which
squares <code>v.y</code>.</p><p>Next, we have an odd instruction: <code>leaq (%rsi,%rdi), %rax</code>. <code>lea</code>
stands for “load effective address”, and it stores the address of the
first operand into the second operand. <code>(%rsi, %rdi)</code> means “the
memory location pointed to by <code>%rsi + %rdi</code>”, so this is just adding
<code>%rsi</code> and <code>%rdi</code> and storing the result in <code>%rax</code>. <code>lea</code> is a quirky
x86-specific instruction; on a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>-y
architecture like ARM64, we would expect to see a plain old <code>add</code>
instruction.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p><p>Finally, <code>retq</code> returns from the <code>normSquared</code> function.</p><p>Let’s take a brief detour to explain what the registers we saw in our
example are. Registers are the “variables” of assembly
langauge. Unlike your favorite programming language (probably), there
are a finite number of them, they have standardized names, and the
ones we’ll be talking about are at most 64 bits in size. Some of them
have specific uses that we’ll see later. I wouldn’t be able to rattle
this off from memory, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features">per
Wikipedia</a>,
the full list<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of 16 registers on x86_64 is <code>rax</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rbp</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdi</code>, <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>, <code>r13</code>,
<code>r14</code>, and <code>r15</code>.</p><p>Now, let’s extend our example to debug print the <code>Vec2</code> in <code>normSquared</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cstdint&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>struct</span> <span>Vec2</span> {
    <span>int64_t</span> x;
    <span>int64_t</span> y;
<span>    <span>void</span> <span>debugPrint</span>() <span>const</span>;
</span>};

<span>int64_t</span> <span>normSquared</span>(Vec2 v) {
<span>    v.debugPrint();
</span>    <span>return</span> v.x <span>*</span> v.x <span>+</span> v.y <span>*</span> v.y;
}
</code></pre></div><p>and, again, let’s see <a href="https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAM1QDsCBlZAQwBtMQBGAFlICsupVs1qhkAUgBMAISnTSAZ0ztkBPHUqZa6AMKpWAVwC2tEJICcpLegAyeWpgByxgEaZiIAGykADqgWE6rR6hiaCfgFqdHYOzkZuHt5KKlG0DATMxAQhxqYWisqYqkHpmQQxTq7uXooZWTlhnLVlFXEJXgCUiqgGxMgcAORSAMz2yIZYANTiwzrICgT49DPY4gAMAILrGwvEBqqTAGpFktMA7LKbk9eT9gSe3AD6BJMAHjOXGze39A/PkwBPD7bb4AN1QeHQkywLgMwAACsQ7hAOpM0LQFsDNuIzgARLFbTZ3P4vWgkIwMACOBkymHQEGOyFOoNROM%2BYIAdDC4YjkR0Cd9iJgCL1aJNQRzXpMAFTiyXTGRygEypUEnG4gZdVggAYAVgGpFMAzWBtQOp0cjkkwUPT6mAVw04BoIOpNHS6AGsQMNhhyff6A4HvNqBtwDUaTaQzQMDQoQGtSC7jZrSHBYEg0EYfHh2GQKBBM9ncyhhKJOJw1k0qDmCO44xAXK6DS57JkATqnaRM0YtAQAPK0Vjt5OkLBGETAdhN0d4IXFUGYOMjzCvIoGWsdg13ZSboR4FzENt6LC7ghIoybro0ehMNgcHj8QSlsSWmR7lxxyBdVA%2BVJLgC0fbDJM/4LOgMy4hIMhyJIkbJEUqSaNoDSmE01itFUHhNBEgR0Ch4T%2BLhtAYfE1RNPBxR0KU9T6LkggUak1HlPYlSkVhzQ0aEqEccxsSYVwXQ2r0/QCUIOr6oa07Rq8AAcnj/g8aLPpM5YcmsHKcJMEC4IQJAOk0kx6FmObuPpqIWtBMjOk27qkF6Pp%2BoGTk%2BsGOphpJI7RrG8aJjZqYwIgKCoMZubkJQhYmR44wTuWlakNWrC1sQ9aNiOLa0G2u7dr2A5DtOY4TlOI74HOagLkukYrmuG4DJ224hpGrD7oexAAsegyRmeeAXrVKbXowLBTg%2BAiSEIE4oK%2B8hNR%2B8Dfr%2BQQAUBIFgRBUGyDIsGxoUlGmBA1j4Zwo3oSxbRkcMviEakB2jThqQke0nDnQxJR1NktGNKNz1Ua991nTx108b9WHDIJtoiZwWrieGUk6rJ8mKdFogqZwakaVpOlEMQ%2BmkIZwVFqZIySOZk3Wcmtn2b6znOWJobQ55OreQmSZupDAySHTkZeb5ZNdAuyVBCA3BAA">the generated assembly</a>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>subq</span>    <span>$24</span>, %rsp

</code></pre></div><p>In addition to the obvious call to <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>, we have
some other new instructions and registers! <code>%rsp</code> is special: it is
the “stack pointer”, used to maintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">function call
stack</a>. It points to the
bottom of the stack, which grows “down” (toward lower addresses) on
x86. So, our <code>subq $24, %rsp</code> instruction is making space for three
64-bit integers on the stack. (In general, setting up the stack and
registers at the start of your function is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue">function
prologue</a>.) Then, the
following two <code>mov</code> instructions store the first and second arguments
to <code>normSquared</code>, which are <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> (more about how parameter
passing words in the next blog post!) to the stack, effectively
creating a copy of <code>v</code> in memory at the address <code>%rsp + 8</code>. Next, we
load the address of our copy of <code>v</code> into <code>%rdi</code> with <code>leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi</code> and then call <code>Vec2::debugPrint() const</code>.</p><p>After <code>debugPrint</code> has returned, we load <code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code> back into
<code>%rcx</code> and <code>%rax</code>. We have the same <code>imulq</code> and <code>addq</code> instructions as
before. Finally, we <code>addq $24, %rsp</code> to clean up the 24
bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of stack space we allocated at the start of
our function (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue#Epilogue">function

</span></code></pre></div><p>Our function prologue has gotten a lot longer, and we have some new
control flow instructions as well. Let’s take a closer look at the
prologue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>pushq</span>   %rbp
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbp
        <span>pushq</span>   %r15
        <span>pushq</span>   %r14
        <span>pushq</span>   %rbx
        <span>pushq</span>   %rax
        <span>movq</span>    %rdi, %r14
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>pushq %rbp; movq %rsp, %rbp</code> sequence is very common: it pushes
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#FRAME-POINTER">frame
pointer</a>
stored in <code>%rbp</code> to the stack and saves the old stack pointer
(which is the new frame pointer) in <code>%rbp</code>. The following four
<code>pushq</code> instructions store registers that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI">we need to save before
using</a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Finally, we save our first argument (<code>%rdi</code>) in <code>%r14</code>.</p><p>On to the function body. We call <code>strlen(s)</code> with <code>callq strlen</code> and
store <code>sSize + 1</code> in <code>%rdi</code> with <code>lea 1(%rax), %rdi</code>.</p><p>Next, we finally see our first <code>if</code> statement! <code>cmpq $1024, %rax</code> sets
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">flags register</a>
according to the result of <code>%rax - $1024</code>, and then <code>ja .LBB0_2</code>
(“jump if above”) transfers control to the location labeled <code>.LBB0_2</code>
if the flags indicate that <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code>. In general, higher-level
control-flow primitives like <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements and loops are
implemented in assembly using conditional jump instructions.</p><p>Let’s first look at the path where <code>%rax &lt;= 1024</code> and thus the branch
to <code>.LBB0_2</code> was not taken. We have a blob of instructions to create
<code>char temp[sSize + 1]</code> on the stack:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %r15
        <span>movq</span>    %rsp, %rbx
        <span>addq</span>    <span>$15</span>, %rdi
        <span>andq</span>    <span>$-16</span>, %rdi
        <span>subq</span>    %rdi, %rbx
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rsp
</code></pre></div><p>We save <code>%rsp</code> to <code>%r15</code> and <code>%rbx</code> for later
use.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Then, we add 15 to <code>%rdi</code> (which,
remember, contains the size of our array), mask off the lower 4 bits
with <code>andq $-16, %rdi</code>, and subtract the result from <code>%rbx</code>, which we
then put back into <code>%rsp</code>. In short, this rounds the array size up to
the next multiple of 16 bytes and makes space for it on the stack.</p><p>The following block simply calls <code>copyUppercase</code> and <code>puts</code> as written in the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>movq</span>    %r14, %rsi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>copyUppercase</span>(<span>char</span>*, <span>char</span> <span>const</span>*)
        <span>movq</span>    %rbx, %rdi
        <span>callq</span>   <span>puts</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we have our function epilogue:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm">        <span>movq</span>    %r15, %rsp
        <span>leaq</span>    -<span>24</span>(%rbp), %rsp
        <span>popq</span>    %rbx
        <span>popq</span>    %r14
        <span>popq</span>    %r15
        <span>popq</span>    %rbp
        <span>retq</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We restore the stack pointer to deallocate our variable-length array
using <code>leaq</code>. Then, we <code>popq</code> the registers we saved during the
function prologue and return control to our caller, and we are done.</p><p>Next, let’s look at the path when <code>%rax &gt; 1024</code> and we branch to
<code>.LBB0_2</code>. This path is more …</p></div></div></div>

            <h2>What is Literate Programming?</h2>
            <p>Literate programming is a style of programming invented by Donald Knuth, where the main idea is
            that a program's source code is made primarily to be read and understood by other people, and
            secondarily to be executed by the computer.</p>
            
            <p>This frees the programmer from the structure of a program imposed by the computer and means that
            the programmer can develop programs in the order of the flow of their thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>A Literate program consists of explanation of the code in a natural language such as English, interspersed
            with snippets of code to be executed. This means that Literate programs are very easy to understand and share,
            as all the code is well explained.</p>
            
            <p>Literate, a tool for literate programming, will allow you to take a literate source file (<code>*.lit</code>) and
            either <em>tangle</em> the source file which will create a file with executable code, or <em>weave</em> the
            source file, which will generate an HTML document to be read as formatted documentation.</p>

            <!-- What are the features of lit -->
            <h2>Features of this tool</h2><p>
            Literate works with any programming language, generates HTML as output (<a href="https://wkhtmltopdf.org/">which can be converted to pdf</a>),
            and generates readable code. The code that is generated is indented properly and is automatically commented using the titles you have written
            for the code blocks.</p><p>
            Here is the full list of features:</p><ul>
                <li>Supports any language including syntax highlighting and pretty printing in HTML</li>
                <li>Generates HTML as output</li>
                <li>Generates readable code and commented in the target language</li>
                <li>Reports syntax errors back from the compiler to the right line in the literate source</li>
                <li>Runs fast -- wc.lit compiled for me in 7ms for both code and html output</li>
                <li>Markdown based -- very easy to read and write Literate source.</li>
                <li>Automatically generates hyperlinks between code sections</li>
                <li>Formatted output similar to CWEB</li>
                <li>Creates an index with identifiers used (you need to have exuberant or universal ctags installed to use this feature)</li>
                <li>Supports TeX equations with <code>$</code> notation</li>
                <li>Compatible with Vim (<a href="https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim" target="_blank">literate.vim</a>)</li>
                <li>Highly customizable</li>
            </ul><p>
            
            You can get started by taking a look at the <a href="https://zyedidia.github.io/literate/manual.html">manual</a>.
            In addition, this website is made with Literate, and the source can be viewed

The following brief post is once again offered largely for the sake of interest, being concerned with the furthest limits of the distribution of early Byzantine material in Eurasia and Africa. What follows consists of a distribution map of fifth- to seventh-century AD Byzantine finds and contemporary imitations accompanied by a brief discussion and illustration of some of the items that have been found in the far west, far east, far north and far south of the 'Old World'. Needless to say, the extensive distribution of early Byzantine material shown here is of interest for a number of reasons from the perspective of this blog, not least the light that it sheds on early medieval Britain's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">Byzantine</a> and <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/05/anglo-saxon-finds-france-africa.html">Indian Ocean</a>&nbsp;imports and connections discussed in previous posts.</p><table><tbody>

The numbers refer to sections in the text, below. Note, the finds in the Kama region of Russia seem to have arrived there in the eighth to twelfth centuries from Central Asia, hence the inclusion—following Mango (ed.),&nbsp;Byzantine Trade, 4th-12th Centuries (Farnham, 2009), fig. 1.1—of a notional grouping of finds in a regular block to the southeast of the Aral Sea and an arrow indicating the relationship between these and the Russian finds.

<p><b>The Far West (1)</b></p><p>

For both <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>, writing near Bethlehem in 396, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4ZUhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+island+of+Britain+lies+virtually+at+the+end+of+the+world%22">Gildas</a>, writing around a century later in late fifth- or early sixth-century Britain, the British Isles lay 'virtually at the end of the world towards the west and north-west'. Despite this, there was clearly an intriguing degree of contact between the British Isles and the early Byzantine empire during the fifth to seventh centuries, as has been discussed at length in a <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html">previous post</a>. In terms of the material evidence for this connection, this is manifested by significant finds of fifth- to sixth-century Eastern Mediterranean and North African <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bBwtGITEd1oC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">pottery</a> in western Britain and <a href="https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/3263">Ireland</a> (with around half of the total coming from the probable royal site of <a href="http://www.medievalhistories.com/luxury-tintagel-early-medieval-period/">Tintagel</a>, Cornwall), alongside Byzantine <a href="https://www.academia.edu/11482638/_Early_Byzantine_copper_coins_found_in_Britain_A_review_of_new_finds_recorded_with_the_Portable_Antiquities_Scheme_Ancient_History_Numismatics_and_Epigraphy_in_the_Mediterranean_World_ed._Og%C5%ADz_Tekin_Yayinlari_Istanbul_2009_263-274">coins</a>, metalwork, and a number of burials of people whose <a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2015/10/oxygen-isotope-evidence.html">isotope results</a> indicate that they could well have grown up in Byzantine North Africa. It has <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kIMmDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">often</a> been <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">suggested</a> that the material in the west may have arrived via a different mechanism to that in the east, perhaps representing direct, official contact via the Straits of Gibraltar and the Atlantic coast vs indirect transfer via merchants and elite exchange along the rivers of mainland Europe, although finds of late sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine coins from the Anglo-Saxon royal site of Rendlesham, Suffolk, have recently been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/div-classtitlesocial-and-economic-complexity-in-early-medieval-england-a-central-place-complex-of-the-east-anglian-kingdom-at-rendlesham-suffolkdiv/FE9E1DB3180F1390E97D97BF28B637D5">interpreted</a> as evidence for 'direct mercantile contacts' with the Byzantine world in eastern Britain too.</p><table><tbody>

<p><b>The Far East (2, 3, 4)</b></p><p>

If there is a substantial amount of early Byzantine material found in Britain and Ireland, the apparent westernmost extremity of the known world in late antiquity, there is also a notable quantity at the far eastern end too. In <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.LX.html#fna_v.LX-p24.1">St Jerome</a>'s letter, cited above, the rhetorical opposite extremity of the world to Britain was given as India, but Roman and Byzantine authors were certainly aware of the existence of China and parts of Southeast Asia. China was, for example, mentioned by <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp261_Roman_Chinese.pdf">Roman</a> and <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">early Byzantine</a> writers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Roman_geography">first century BC onwards</a> and it is included not only in Ptolemy's second-century AD <i><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg">Geography</a></i> (which mentions parts of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg">Southeast Asia</a> too), but also on the <i><a href="http://www.euratlas.net/cartogra/peutinger/11_india/india_8_2.html">Tabula Peutingeriana</a></i>, a fascinating map that seems to have had its origins in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_Peutingeriana">Late Roman period</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Roman</a> and especially <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Chinese sources</a> make several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Possible_Roman_Greeks_in_Burma_and_China">references</a> to Hellenistic, Roman and early Byzantine entertainers, merchants and/or embassies being present in China and Southeast Asia, including a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">mission in 166 AD</a> that arrived via the south coast—probably entering China via Vietnam and claiming to have been sent by the Roman emperor <i>Andun</i> (Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus?), although this was perhaps really a commercial action that chose to represent itself this way—and numerous seventh- and eighth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Roman_relations#Fulin:_Eastern_Roman_embassies">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://byzantineperspectives.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/what-does-tang-china-have-in-common-with-anglo-saxon-england/">embassies</a>&nbsp;to Tang China.</p><p>

In terms of the early Byzantine material found in eastern parts of Eurasia, there is a variety of surviving artefacts ranging from glass vessels, metalwork and textiles through to gold and bronze coinage, with the latter being by far the most numerous category. The most easterly early Byzantine artefacts are actually found in Korea and Japan ('2' on the map, above). The former has seen finds of <a href="https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/glass-vessels/cwFZdR3ccuXZ-w?hl=en">glass vessels</a> from the late fifth- to early sixth-century AD royal tombs at <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm">Silla, Korea</a>, some of which appear to have actually been <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpanKmU_ckYC&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">made in</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-19-1-1.pdf">the early Byzantine empire</a> and others of which are believed to be <a href="http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/Silk_Roads/The_Eastern_Silk_Roads_Story_2015_Conference_Proceedings_UNESCO_re.pdf">imitative</a> of Late Roman/Early Byzantine forms, whilst in Japan there have been not only finds of early Byzantine 'Levantine 1' <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284359734_Archaeometrical_investigation_of_natron_glass_excavated_in_Japan">glass beads</a> (probably made on the coast of present-day northern Israel) from fifth-century AD tombs, but the important mid-eighth-century AD imperial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8Di">Shōsōin Repository</a> at Nara, Japan, is also reported to contain a number of Byzantine items including a <a href="http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp206_sasanian_persia.pdf">cushion cover</a> made in early Byzantine Syria. Interestingly, neither Japan nor Korea is mentioned in Roman or Byzantine sources, although a recent isotopic and mitochondrial DNA <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236210479_Stable_isotope_and_mtDNA_evidence_for_geographic_origins_at_the_site_of_Vagnari_South_Italy">study of burials</a> on the Imperial estate at Vagnari, southern Italy, has indicated that one of the adults buried there in the first or second century AD could have had Japanese ancestry, given that 'all modern mtDNA matches to her available haplotype sequence are from Japan'.<sup><a href="http://www.caitlingreen.org/2017/03/a-very-long-way-from-home.html#fn2">(2)</a></sup></p><p>

In addition to this material from the very far east, we also have a notable quantity of primarily sixth- to early seventh-century Byzantine <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">gold coins</a> and sixth- to eighth-century imitations from <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">tombs in China</a>, along with a number of <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C9A7DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;pg=RA1-PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">finds</a> of early Byzantine metalwork and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-06_M-L._Chen,_The_Importation_of_Byzantine_and_Sasanian_Glass_into_China_during_the_fourth_to_sixth_centuries.pdf">glassware</a> (and imitations of the same) from this country too. Both this material and that discussed in the preceding paragraph is <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-09_A._Harris,_Britain_and_China_at_opposite_ends_of_the_world.pdf">often thought</a> <a href="http://www.silk-road.com/newsletter/vol3num2/4_ying.php">to have arrived</a> via Central Asia along the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>', especially given the presence of a number of <a href="https://www.academia.edu/27959139/Sogdiana_its_Christians_and_Byzantium_a_Study_of_Artistic_and_Cultural_Connections_in_Late_Antiquity_and_Early_Middle_Ages">similar finds</a> in areas such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, although some of the Byzantine items found close to the Chinese coast and in Korea and Japan could have alternatively arrived by the less-discussed southern, maritime 'branch' of the Silk Road instead. Certainly, earlier <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1945062/The_Roman_Empire_according_to_the_Ancient_Chinese_Sources">Roman</a> and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Greek</a> <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12682533/The_Power_of_Images_Coin_Portraits_of_Roman_Emperors_on_Jewellery_Pendants_in_Early_Southeast_Asia">mariners</a>&nbsp;made use of this route, and early Byzantine <a href="http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/transcultural/article/view/6127/2962">written sources</a> moreover appear to make reference to it, whilst finds of fifth- to seventh-century&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire">Sasanian</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caitlinrgreen/status/832976763626078211">glassware</a>&nbsp;in Japan are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/28504387/Priestman_2016_The_Silk_Road_or_the_Sea_Sasanian_and_Islamic_Exports_to_Japan">argued</a> to have probably arrived there via the sea route. With regard to this maritime 'road', another relevant find may well be that of a probably sixth-century Byzantine <a href="http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_096_0b_Borrell_EarlyByzantineLampFromPongTuk.pdf">lamp</a> found in Thailand (marked as '3' on the map, above), and it is worth noting in this context that an East Javanese <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LhaWBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><i>millefiori</i></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebeadsite.com/abm-rio3.html">bead</a> of sixth-century date has been found at the Byzantine Red Sea port of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenice_Troglodytica">Berenike</a> too (curiously, such beads are <a href="http://www.aihv.org/en/pdf/16-77.pdf">very rare indeed</a> outside of East Java, with the only other concentration really being in the Silla tombs of Korea, mentioned above!).</p><p>

Finally, thousands of fifth- to seventh-century <a href="http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5357/1/Darley14PhD_redacted.pdf">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/10027506/Self_Other_and_the_Use_and_Appropriation_of_Late_Roman_coins_in_south_India_and_Sri_Lanka_4th-7th_centuries_A.D._">gold</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271621898_Roman_Coins_from_the_Masson_and_Mackenzie_Collections_in_the_British_Museum">bronze</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292142132_The_Role_of_Monetary_Networks_in_the_Trade_between_India_and_the_Roman_Empire">coins</a> and imitations are known from India and Sri Lanka ('4' on the map), accompanied by fifth- to sixth-century <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk:8081/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2006-02_K._R._Dark,_Globalizing_Late_Antiquity.pdf">amphorae</a> on coastal and inland sites in western India.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div id="pico"><p>The year is 1964. The United States and the Soviet Union have narrowly avoided full-scale nuclear destruction and resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War looms on the horizon, and Mao Zedong’s China—fresh off a split with the Soviets—has just successfully blown up its first atomic bomb in a dry lakebed in southeastern Xinjiang, near what is now the <a href="https://www.wildcamels.com/what-we-do/lop-nur-nature-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest reserve for Bactrian camels</a>. </p><p>China’s nuclear test announced the country as the world’s fifth nuclear-armed nation, though unlike France, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese nuclear program was a black box for American intelligence. <a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb488/docs/Doc%2028%2011-2-64%20inr%20on%20chinese%20test.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recently declassified government files show</a>, for example, that the U.S. was shocked to learn that the bomb was fueled by uranium, not plutonium. Military-industrial honchos were left scratching their heads as to how to gather intelligence, until a chance meeting between General Curtis LeMay and mountaineer Barry Bishop at a Washington D.C. cocktail party led to one of the most quixotic, unsuccessful operations in the CIA’s long history of screwups.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="792" height="612" src="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg 792w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=768,593 768w, https://admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2021/02/china-debris.jpg?resize=62,48 62w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px"><figcaption><a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb488/docs/doc%2033%201-0-65%20circa%20AFtAC%20report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Air Force analysis</a> of nuclear debris scatter, which confirmed the use of enriched uranium. The lower of the two large arrows flows from the Xinjiang test site.</figcaption></figure><p>Bishop was part of the first American team to summit Mt. Everest the year prior, and according to <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Takeda’s fascinating 2007 <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>, he gushed about the unobstructed views he enjoyed from the world’s (<a href="https://defector.com/a-geologist-rocks-my-world-on-why-earths-tallest-mountain-isnt-so-obvious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arguably</a>) tallest mountain. Takeda writes that LeMay put the pieces together and, “From this casual exchange emerged an unlikely inspiration: Recruit America’s best high-altitude climbers to place a nuclear powered observation device atop the world’s greatest mountain range.” The hope was that a transceiver could pick up radio communications between Chinese nuclear personnel, remaining functional for years off of the heat from decaying plutonium isotopes. Per Takeda, the CIA’s device was an “oven-sized metal bin with five radiating fins” that weighed 125 pounds and was topped by a six-foot long antenna. If this sounds like a crude product of ’60s nuclear frenzy, consider that <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/electrical-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s Perseverance rover</a> is scooting around on Mars thanks to this exact sort of battery. </p><p>Bishop could no longer climb high alpine peaks after <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/first-successful-us-everest-summit-took-a-toll-on-barry-bishops-boots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing all of his toes in the Everest expedition</a>, but by 1965, the CIA started putting together a team, picked a name (Operation Hat), and chose a mountain. Everest straddled China’s border, so it was out of contention. CIA officials eventually chose Nanda Devi, the tallest peak entirely within India’s borders. Nanda Devi offered two advantages to the Americans: long sightlines into Western China and the help of an Indian state that the U.S. had just supported in its 1962 border skirmish with China. </p><p>At this point in history, Nanda Devi had only been summited by six people, with three others dying in the process, so the CIA recruited a dream team of famous American climbers. The corps included pioneering El Capitan big-waller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/obituaries/tom-frost-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Frost</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/07/us/luther-jerstad-61-alpinist-who-scaled-everest-in-1963.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1963 Everest</a> veteran Lute Jerstad, <em>Sports Illustrated</em> cover darling <a href="https://gripped.com/profiles/jim-mccarthy-was-first-climber-on-sports-illustrated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim McCarthy</a>, and the unsung alpinist <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/S0002-9610(16)31088-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Schaller</a>. They <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a training course</a> on nuclear technology and “the Asian mentality” at a South Carolina military base, though the climbers say they mostly spent time “playing volleyball and doing some serious drinking.” <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1978STATE094511_d.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The full team undertook a training mission on Mount McKinley</a> in June with their Indian counterparts, and even though “distressing weather and other difficulties kept them from the summit,” the CIA “chose to ignore” the omens and the American-Indian team set out for Nanda Devi in October 1965. </p><p>The CIA has not yet declassified files from the expedition, including apparently extensive photographs and journal records made by Schaller, so we do not have a detailed account of what happened on the mountain. But we do know how the mission ended: catastrophic failure. A storm pinned several climbers and the device down while they were roughly 1,800 feet from the summit. Indian intelligence lead Capt. M.S. Kohli was forced to call a retreat, and the team stashed the device in a crevice and attempted to anchor it in place, so it would stay put until they could come and retrieve it on the other side of winter.</p><p>McCarthy spoke at length with Takeda <a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the <em>Rock And Ice</em> story</a>—which really is great, Takeda makes his own attempt on Nanda Devi and narrowly escapes death by avalanche—and he recalled his fury at the expedition’s failure:</p><blockquote><p>When I realize that they’re dumping the fucking generator and going down the mountain, I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you doing? Have them bring it down! Are you crazy?’ I’m yelling at the top of my lungs.” According to McCarthy, the CIA case officer nearly had to pull him off Kohli. “He says to me,” McCarthy says, ‘You are creating an international incident!’”</p><p>“But,” McCarthy adds, “I had a vision of absolute clarity. We’re going to lose a SNAP generator, powered by plutonium, in the headwaters of the Ganges!”</p><cite><a href="https://rockandice.com/snowball/the-secret-of-nanda-devi/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock And Ice</a></cite></blockquote><p>That might be what wound up happening. Nobody knows where the device ended up, since it disappeared from Nanda Devi at some point in the winter. The CIA ran a total of eight field operations in the region between 1965 and 1968, aimed at both finding the first device and getting another one up and running. Though they eventually implanted a plutonium device on nearby Nanda Kot, they have never been able to find their lost transceiver. The successfully placed device was also quickly buried under the snow and stopped working months later, after producing no useful intelligence.</p><p>The grim failure of Operation Hat resurfaced this month after violent floods killed over 50 people in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The floods <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/07/world/asia/india-glacier-flood-uttarakhand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most likely began</a> when a chunk of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off and trapped flowing water, forming a lake that eventually burst through and swept through nearby valleys. The undeniable oddness of a glacial breaking apart during the winter has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56102459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led some locals to speculate</a> that perhaps the plutonium generator, which is still likely producing heat, led to the deadly floods.</p><p>There’s no evidence for the hypothesis, though even after years of reconnaissance missions and rigorous chemical assays of the surrounding area, nobody knows where the CIA’s lost nuclear-powered spy oven is. </p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The U.S. government has asked Google to fork over granular data on how its search engine works and is monetized, seeking to prove that the internet giant is a monopoly.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice and several state attorneys general are seeking comparable data on U.S. search results and related ad from Feb. 2, 2015 to Feb. 8, 2015 and from Feb. 3, 2020 to Feb. 9, 2020, according to a legal filing Monday.</p>

<p>The Alphabet Inc. unit is being asked to share data on how and where users searched in those periods, the quantity of different types of ads, revenue from those ads and what the underlying bids were for them, among other details. The government told the company it wants the information within 30 days.</p>

<p>The Justice Department under former U.S. President Donald Trump and 11 Republican attorneys general originally filed the suit. Three other states have since joined, including California, the site of Googleâ€™s headquarters. The latest data request shows the government is pressing ahead under a new administration led by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

<p>The U.S. government alleges Googleâ€™s exclusive deals to distribute its search engine on browsers and phones, including Apple Inc.â€™s iPhones, violates the Sherman Actâ€™s prohibition on monopolization. Itâ€™s the most significant U.S. monopoly case since the one against Microsoft Corp. more than 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Google has said its deals donâ€™t prevent consumers from switching to other search providers. The company argues its success rests on superior technology.</p>
