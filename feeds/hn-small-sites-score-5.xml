And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. <strong>The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.</strong> Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.</strong> We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative. We're currently in conversations with different actors of the OSS world to make sure the initiative remains independent.</p><p>Also, we want you to work with us. <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/jobs">We are hiring</a> at Postman to work full-time on AsyncAPI. In the first half of 2021, we'll open a bunch of positions, including Software Engineers, Graphic Designers, Technical Writers, and more. Make sure you don't miss them!</p><div><h3>Receive an email when we publish a new job offer:</h3><p>We respect your inbox. No spam, promise ✌️</p></div><p>Before I finish, I would love to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/a85">Abhinav Asthana</a> for being so supportive. And of course, a huge shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/derberq">Łukasz Gornicki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/e_morcillo">Eva Morcillo</a> for their tireless support. None of these would be possible without their help.</p><p>There's a bright future ahead for Asynchronous APIs. 2021 will be the year of AsyncAPI, the year of you, our beloved open-source community.</p><p><undefined>Cheers! <span role="img" aria-label="clinking beer mugs">🍻</span></undefined></p></article></div>]]>

December 8, 2020 | https://blog.suborbital.dev/building-a-better-monolith | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.suborbital.dev/building-a-better-monolith">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="the-monolith-gets-a-bad-rap">The monolith gets a bad rap</h2>
<p>When you hear that a company runs a monolith, you may think they're old-fashioned and they must have trouble scaling it, right? I'm here to tell you that <a target="_blank" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">some people</a> (myself included) think monoliths are awesome for a whole lot of teams. That said, technology has advanced, and I truly think it's time to revisit the monolith with a new approach.</p>
<p>If you're new to back-end development, a monolith is a server-side system that runs as one.... thing. It's a single program that starts up, serves some network requests, and then terminates. Alternatives to 'the monolith' include service-oriented architectures (SOA), microservices, serverless functions, and probably a few that I haven't heard of. Each of these approaches has their time and place, and I salute anyone who has made an educated decision to build a system with these patterns. I'm of the opinion that a large number of web applications and services would be well served by a monolith.... but with some upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="you-need-some-services-to-lighten-the-load">You need some services to lighten the load</h2>
<p>The reasoning behind the alternative design patterns is very sound. By distributing the work among many different “things”, you make the system as a whole able to handle more. It is well known that by doing so, you introduce more complexity, which requires more effort, and therefore often more people-power and more money. The one possible exception I can see is serverless functions, which do indeed simplify many things, but whose downsides comes in the form of more difficult testing, vendor dependence, or the need for non-commodity tooling. When done right, the extra effort can lead to a very capable system whose benefits are truly remarkable. The classic example is Netflix, and they’ve done very well for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-middle-ground">Finding a middle ground</h2>
<p>If monoliths are hard to scale and microservices are too complex, then how do you design a system that can scale with your traffic and your development team without becoming a pain to operate, maintain and expand its functionality? Over the past few years, it has become clear that a middle-ground is needed. I don’t expect this solution to work for everyone, but most products aren’t serving the kind of traffic that <strong>really</strong> makes the microservice effort worth it.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-sufa-design-pattern">Enter the SUFA design pattern</h2>
<p>Before getting into the core of what SUFA is, I want to mention that this is not an entirely new way of thinking. Things like the actor pattern, the <a target="_blank" href="https://inconshreveable.com/10-07-2015/the-neomonolith/">Neomonolith</a>, and others have stipulated some similar ideas over the years, and SUFA is just one way of combining several concepts into one straightforward design pattern. So, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Simple, Unified, Function-based Applications.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s break that down:</p>
<h3 id="simple">Simple</h3>
<p>A system designed with SUFA can be run in the simplest of deployment scenarios. Auto-scaling groups have existed for a long time, and they’re made even easier by container orchestration systems. A SUFA system can be run on one ASG, or can be expanded with a service mesh to allow for capability groups (which we’ll talk about in a future post).</p>
<h3 id="unified">Unified</h3>
<p>Rather than multiple services who each exist as something to be deployed, SUFA systems exist as one single deployable. This can be a Docker image, an AMI, or some other artifact, but there is only one <strong>thing</strong> that needs to be built. It should be built by CI/CD on a continuous or tagged release cadence, and it should be made available in an artifact registry such as a Docker registry or S3 bucket. </p>
<h3 id="function-based">Function-based</h3>
<p>A standard monolith probably includes a handler layer which is responsible for taking API requests and making calls to a business logic or data storage layer to handle those requests. SUFA systems instead handle requests by chaining together a series of functions, each completely independent and unaware of one another. Functions should expect a particular input, perform some operations, and produce an output to be passed into functions further down the chain. Functions should be easily testable and reusable across different scenarios (such as for different API requests). SUFA systems should also be designed to consume and produce event-based traffic as a primary method of communication.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Well this seems like it should be straightforward, but in SUFA design, “Application” has a very particular meaning. A SUFA system should serve one single application, meaning that it should encompass all of the capabilities needed for a fully formed product. This can be up for some interpretation (such as whether a company should have one SUFA for their whole business, even if they have distinct product areas), but the point is to avoid having multiple “things” serving one application. If functionality needs to be shared across multiple applications, the functions comprising the SUFA system should be easily reusable and composed for other purposes. </p>
<p>You'll notice that this is all very technology-agnostic and vendor-agnostic. SUFA is meant to span across languages, cloud vendors, and deployment environments. SUFA is a way of designing your server-side system such that it is testable, scalable, and secure. You'll notice I haven't touched on scalability yet, so let's discuss that</p>
<h2 id="sufa-at-scale">SUFA at scale</h2>
<p>The critical factor that allows a SUFA system to scale is that it is composed of independent functions. SUFA systems should rely on an underlying framework to orchestrate the execution of these functions such that it can scale effectively. By using a function runner or job scheduler to run the required functions, a SUFA framework abstracts away <em>how</em> the functions are executed, and the programmer writing the code only needs to indicate which functions to run, and in what order.</p>
<p>Additional scalability is provided by <strong>capability groups</strong> and <strong>meshing</strong>, which I plan on writing follow-up posts for, as they deserve to be explored at length.</p>
<h2 id="suborbital-atmo">Suborbital Atmo</h2>
<p>The SUFA pattern was designed in concert with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo">Atmo</a>, which is an all-in-one framework upon which SUFA systems can be built. Atmo uses a file known as a 'Directive' to describe all aspects of your application, including how to chain functions to handle requests. You can write your functions using several languages to be run atop Atmo, as it is built to use WebAssembly modules as the unit of compute. Atmo will automatically scale out to handle your application load, and includes all sorts of tooling and built-in best practices to ensure you're getting the best performance and security without needing to write a single line of boilerplate ever again.</p>
<p>The awesome capabilities of WebAssembly and the design thinking behind SUFA are being harnessed by the open source <a target="_blank" href="https://suborbital.dev/">Suborbital Development Platform</a> to introduce a new way to build your web applications. I've been working for over a year to realize this goal, and I'm extremely happy with the results thus far. Riding the wave of new technologies and practices such as JAMStack and edge computing means that we have a opportunity to bring the best of the old and the new to the next generation of software makers to do incredible things. I hope you'll come and join me!</p>

Most off-the-shelf providers like Shopify and BigCommerce are built for small stores selling a few million dollars in orders per month, so many e-commerce retailers working at scale start to investigate creating a bespoke solution.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This article will look at what it takes to start building this infrastructure on your own. What are some of the areas to consider? What might the data model look like? How much work is involved?</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll explore an alternative: API-based commerce platforms that manage data for you across product catalogs, pricing, and orders—without locking you into a monolith, and without requiring you to replatform.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> A full summary diagram of the e-commerce data model is at the end of the article.</em></p>

<h2 id="who-are-your-customers-">Who Are Your Customers?</h2>
<p>First, you need to consider <em>who</em> will be purchasing items from your e-commerce application. How might you model customer information in a database as a result? You’ll probably want to have basic information like your customer's name, email address, etc. Do you want your customers to be able to create a profile in your system? Or just fill out a form each time they want to purchase something?</p>
<p>Just starting out, a basic model might look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="Basic e-commerce customer data model" width="308" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=154&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 154w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=308&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 308w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=462&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 462w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=616&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 616w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=770&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 770w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=924&amp;name=Basic%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 924w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px"></p>
<p>If you want your customers to have a persistent profile, then you need to build some way for them to log in to your application. Moving forward with more real-world requirements, you might also want to keep track of their login attempt history and password history.</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce customer data model" width="891" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=446&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 446w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 891w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1337&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1337w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1782&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1782w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2228&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2228w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2673&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2673w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></p>
<p>You might also want to consider whether your customers are part of a large organization; and, if so, how would they like to handle password resets? Do they need single sign-on or OAuth support?</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-addresses">Deep Dive: Addresses</h4>
<p>Did you notice there’s no address tied to a customer in any of the data models shown so far? It might be your first inclination to include a customer’s address as part of those models. However, most customers will have multiple addresses and multiple <em>kinds</em> of addresses, like billing and shipping. B2B retailers might also have to consider multiple delivery locations based on the number of warehouses and offices they support.</p>
<p>What happens if the billing and shipping address are different? Well, you’ll need to do more than just add extra columns to the <code>Customer</code> table! It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>So how <em>does</em> storing a billing address affect the scalability of your application?</p>
<p>If you were to split the payment and shipping areas into separate (micro)services each having their own database, then putting billing and payment addresses into the <code>Customer</code> area would lead to having “chatty” services. This is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/chattiness.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-known <em>design smell</em> when building microservices</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, you’re better off putting the addresses within the appropriate area/service that requires them, but with that, your data model becomes more complex.</p>
<p>One way to avoid much of this complexity is to consider an <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/oms-software" rel="noopener">order management system (OMS)</a> by an API-first software provider. With this software, you can integrate the OMS into your data model without spending months of engineering time.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-organize-products-and-catalog-">How Do You Organize Products And Catalog?</h2>
<p>The first thing you see when you enter a store (either in-person or digitally) are products ready for you to purchase, and usually displayed with some thought for how you might be likely to shop.</p>
<p>For an e-commerce web application, you will probably want to highlight things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best selling products</li>
<li>Trending products</li>
<li>New products</li>
<li>The ability to browse products by search criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing customers with that information means you first need to keep track of a lot of data about your products: their prices, historical purchase data, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a “first shot” at creating a data model for a product catalog might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="Simple e-commerce product data model" width="562" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=281&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 281w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 562w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=843&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 843w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1124&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1124w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1405&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1405w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1686&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1686w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"></p>
<p>Here’s a <code>Product</code> table with some basic information, like a product’s name, SKU, and price. The product is also linked to another table representing various categories that product is associated with. You might also strategically add indexes and full-text search to the <code>Product</code> table to enable site visitors to efficiently search for various products.</p>
<p>This is a decent first attempt. However, to get an even more realistic and useful e-commerce product catalog, you’ll need to support more requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking pricing history so site administrators can analyze trends in product pricing</li>
<li>Supporting related products to display on a product’s page</li>
<li>Incorporating product vendors so customers can view all products sold by an individual vendor/company</li>
</ul>
<p>To address those extra requirements, you might end up with the following data model:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce product data model" width="816" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=408&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 408w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 816w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1224&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1632&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1632w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2040&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2040w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2448&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2448w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px"></p>
<p>This model still isn’t perfect as it embeds your prices into the product itself, but at least it lets you maintain a previous pricing history.</p>
<p>Another option is to integrate your e-commerce store with a <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/promotions-engine" rel="noopener">pricing and promotions engine</a> from an API-first software provider that handles pricing for you. This will let you roll out different prices to different users based on their intent, location, cart, or order history.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-pricing">Deep Dive: Pricing</h4>
<p>While the more complex product data model still has a product’s price in the same table, this may not be the best thing to do in a real large-scale application.</p>
<p>Consider that your organization has various departments, such as inventory/warehousing, sales, marketing, customer support, etc. You might have dedicated systems that allow merchandisers to change the price of an item since they are the experts in determining how much a product should sell for. Similar to the considerations with a customer’s billing and shipping addresses, this would lead to cross-boundary/service communication if we left the price in the core <code>Product</code> table.</p>
<p>Therefore, you might want to store product prices under the data stores that the sales department owns. But don’t forget, there are many different kinds of “prices” that haven’t been taken into consideration yet, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price (cost) when purchasing stock from vendors</li>
<li>Customer sale price</li>
<li>Discounted sale prices</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s suggested retail price</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling all these in context of your organizational structure would require even more exploration and complexity in your data model. While your engineering team could likely accomplish this task, it’s going to take time. Using ready-made solutions can shave weeks or months off your e-commerce data modeling timeline.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-streamline-orders-">How Do You Streamline Orders?</h2>
<p>Now that you have customers in your database and products available to purchase, you’ll need to think about how to design the order-taking process and data model.</p>
<p>The process of placing an order might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer places products into their cart while browsing.</li>
<li>The customer decides they want to purchase the products that are in their cart.</li>
<li>They proceed to purchase the order.</li>
<li>The customer gets an emailed receipt or confirmation number.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s rarely so simple. Placing orders can be deceptively tricky as there are many moving parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>An active cart</li>
<li>Cart converted into an order</li>
<li>A finalized order with confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to look at a simple data model for an order placement, it might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png" alt="Orders data model" width="837" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=419&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 419w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 837w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1256&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1256w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1674&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1674w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2093&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2093w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2511&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2511w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"></p>
<p>Notice that each row in the <code>ShoppingCartItem</code> table contains the “captured” price of the product. When the customer puts an item into their shopping cart should the price at that moment be “locked-in”? If so, for how long?</p>
<p><em><span>Note:</span> How the price functions is a business requirement that would need to be discussed with your product owners, and so on, as mentioned in the "Deep Dive: Pricing" section earlier.</em></p>
<p>The same question applies to an unpaid order. If a customer has ordered a discounted item, should they be able to keep the promise of that discounted price forever until they pay? Or does it expire?</p>
<p>Other questions to consider for an orders data model might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you tracking analytics on orders?</li>
<li>What happens if a customer returns a defective item?</li>
<li>Should you handle shipping within the same data model or have a dedicated shipping context/schema?</li>
</ul>
<p>With some of these concerns in mind, you might end up with a data model that looks more like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex orders data model" width="1112" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=556&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 556w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1112w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1668&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1668w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2224&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2780&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2780w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=3336&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 3336w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></p>
<p>Some things to take note of in this more complex orders model:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShoppingCartItem</code> now supports an expiration date for a locked-in price.</li>
<li><code>ShoppingCartHistory</code> tracks when items are added, removed, etc.</li>
<li>An order item may be returned (this still does not handle cases where 1 out of X items of the same product are returned).</li>
<li>An order may have multiple shipments (eg, how Amazon will sometimes split an order up into multiple packages/shipments).</li>
</ul>
<p>This article also hasn’t even touched the surface of using alternative data storage methods like JSON documents or event sourcing!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To help you see how all the pieces fit together, here are all the diagrams shown together. I’ve removed a number of links/lines to the <code>Customer</code> table to increase readability:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=1396&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png" alt="Summary e-commerce data model" width="1396" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=698&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 698w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=1396&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 1396w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=2094&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 2094w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=2792&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 2792w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=3490&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 3490w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png?width=4188&amp;name=Summary%20e-commerce%20data%20model.png 4188w" sizes="(max-width: 1396px) 100vw, 1396px"></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this article still doesn’t even cover many of the basics like payment processing and invoicing. Beyond the features covered here, you might eventually require more advanced features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupon codes</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Third-party integrations with OAuth providers, other retailers, or partners</li>
<li>Shipment tracking notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a data model for an e-commerce application, as you can see, is not so simple. What looks up front to be a straightforward set of database tables is not so simple once you dig into real-world requirements.</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p>Today's article is about working with external volumes for your
unikernel instance. Many applications won't use this feature but there
are also situations where this makes sense.</p>

<p>The most obvious time when you would want to attach a volume to your
unikernel instance is when you are working with a database. Your
database image probably doesn't change that much but many databases can
grow very large and it makes no sense to keep the same data volume in
your base image.</p>

<p>The second use-case is when you have a base image, say a webserver,
and you want to package additional files or configuation as a build
step. For instance some companies will rotate certificates every few
hours in the day to protect access to various services and this rotation
is usually done out-of-band of deploys. Now unikernel deploys for small
webservers are typically fairly fast but the ability to put your
configuration on a separate partition and re-mount the volume on the fly
every few hours is definitely enticing.</p>

<p>Ok, let's start with the code. For this example we have a simple
little go webserver that implements a root filesystem filewalker. We've
declared that there is a separate partition called 'mnt' in the code but
it is non-existent right now.</p>

<pre><code>import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "net/http"
  "os"
  "path/filepath"
)

func printDir() {
  err := filepath.Walk("/",
    func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
      fmt.Println(path, info.Size())
      return nil
    })
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}

func main() {
  printDir()

  b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(b))

  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    printDir()

    b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(string(b))
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to my website!")
  })

  fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static/"))
  http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fs))

  go func() {
    err = http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }
  }()

  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
</code></pre><p>

If you run it locally you should see something like this:
</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2

open /mnt/bob.txt: no such file or directory
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating a Volume</h3>

<p>Let's create a simple volume with one file in it - bob.txt.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir mnt
echo "Hi - I'm a text file" &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:12:35 volume: mnt created with UUID 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e and label mnt
</code></pre><p>

You'll see that we can now see it in our local volume store:

</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops volume list
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
|                 UUID                 | NAME | STATUS | SIZE (GB) | LOCATION                                 | CREATED | ATTACHED |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
| 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e | mnt  |        | 1.6 MB    | /Users/eyberg/.ops/volumes/mnt:04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e.raw |         |          |
+--------------------------------------+------+--------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+----------+
</code></pre>

<h3>Attaching a Volume</h3>

<p>You can attach a volume to an instance that is expecting one. So that
means when we create the image we'll want to pass any mount points with
the volume label and mount path - this is loosely similar to how
something in /etc/fstab would work. Ran locally you can test with 'ops
run' but you can pass the same '--mounts' flag when issuing 'ops image
create' for images ran on Google or AWS. Let's try it out locally:
</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt:/mnt
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

/sys/devices/system/cpu 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online 0
Hi - I'm a text file
</code></pre>

<p>Cool! It works! Now let's edit the file.</p>

<pre><code>echo "New text has come to light." &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt2 -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:19:41 volume: mnt2 created with UUID f82da0e3-3980-ddd8-5720-e1b320e21371 and label mnt2
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind we are creating a *new* volume with new contents and then re-attaching the volume to the instance.</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt2:/mnt
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...

New text has come to light.
</code></pre>

<p>If you are attaching the volume to an instance on Google or AWS you'd
use the attach command:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume attach g2 mnt mnt2 -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you can detach as well:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume detach g2 mnt -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>What's really great about unikernel volumes when working on AWS or
Google is that this is all managed for you by the cloud provider of choice. There is no duplicate storage layer
you have to manage like you do in container land. Now you know the basics of mounting external volumes into your unikernel images.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

    </span><a href="#about-serverless-express">About Serverless Express</a></h2><p>Back in 2016 I was General Manager of two up-and-coming AWS Services: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>.</p><p>APIs were already well understood by our customer base, but selling Lambda was initially a little more difficult - not only was the idea of a fully managed, pay-by-the-call function hosting service a novelty among public cloud providers, it was also very different from existing developer practices. Case in point: <em>Express-based web services</em>.</p><p>Lambda launched with support for <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which helped a lot of customers start using it easily, given their existing familiarity with <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>. But for many customers, just having a familiar language wasn’t enough — they were also looking for familiar frameworks, such as <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, on which to build their Lambda-based web applications.</p><p>After hearing this feedback from many customers, we realized we needed to “meet customers where they were” by bringing Serverless solutions to existing frameworks….and thus the <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express">Serverless Express GitHub project</a> was born!</p><p>Over the course of the last four years many developers have adopted Serverless solutions, including Serverless Express, to help accelerate development and gain Serverless benefits like lower operational overhead, automatic per-request scaling, built-in fault tolerance, and pay-per-call pricing. Today, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express">aws-serverless-express</a> NPM package gets over 1.3M downloads per month, and its GitHub repository has over 3.7K stars.</p><p>The original author of the Serverless Express project, <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSbrett">Brett Andrews</a>, joined <a href="http://vendia.net/">Vendia</a> recently, and we realized we can do even more in our mission to help customers share code and data effectively by giving back to the open source community by helping the Serverless Express project “graduate” from its initial location in AWS Labs to a permanent place in Vendia’s repository. As the original project sponsor, and with the guidance of the project’s original author, AWS trusted us to being thoughtful and proactive stewards of this project. We will continue meeting with AWS monthly to gather customer feedback, and be briefed on upcoming AWS Serverless releases so that we may be a launch partner and provide day 1 support in Serverless Express.</p><h2 id="migration-instructions"><span data-href="#migration-instructions">

    </span><a href="#migration-instructions">Migration Instructions</a></h2><p>If you’re an existing Serverless Express user, you don’t need to take any immediate action. For convenience we’ve published <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express">aws-serverless-express v3.4.0</a> that takes a direct dependency on the new official package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vendia/serverless-express">@vendia/serverless-express@^3.4.0</a>.</p><p>This means that by simply upgrading to <a href="mailto:aws-serverless-express@3.4.0">aws-serverless-express@3.4.0</a> you’ll get all downstream patches and features without needing to update your code. Alternatively, you can run the following command  to take a direct dependency on the new official package</p><pre><code><span>npm</span> uninstall aws-serverless-express <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> @vendia/serverless-express
</code></pre><p>After updating the deps, update your code accordingly - e.g., change your imports.</p><pre><code><span>- require('aws-serverless-express')
</span><span>+ require('@vendia/serverless-express')
</span></code></pre><p>If you're new to Serverless Express and wondering how to get started, you can deploy a Serverless REST API to AWS in under 5 minutes by following the <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express/tree/master/examples/basic-starter">Serverless Express Basic Starter on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="whats-next"><span data-href="#whats-next">
      <svg>
        <use href="#link-out"></use>
      </svg>
    </span><a href="#whats-next">Whats Next</a></h2><p>In January 2021 we'll be releasing Serverless Express v4 that:</p><ol><li>Supports event sources other than API Gateway such as ALB, Lambda Edge, HTTP API, and makes it easy to provide your own custom event source mapping for other services that are integrated with Lambda</li><li>Has improved logging and debugging support</li><li>Is more extensible and simpler to use with an improved developer experience</li><li>Uses Promise resolution by default</li><li>Is upgraded to Node.js 10 (compatible with Node.js 12+)</li><li>Makes it easier to work with Custom Domain Names</li><li>Has improved documentation and examples</li><li>Supports Multiple header values</li></ol><p><em>What’s in it for Vendia?</em> First of all, Brett and I feel a strong connection to helping the Serverless community succeed. Technologies like Lambda, managed API and database services, and other Serverless offerings power Vendia’s implementations and help us deliver scalable, low-cost code and data sharing solutions for our customers. We also continue to believe strongly in the mission of Serverless Express: To give developers a simple, scalable platform that meets them where they are, and then helps them gain the best of what the cloud has to offer...without unnecessary retraining, rewriting, or porting exercises. We're also excited to find ways to bring Vendia Share - the next generation Serverless platform - and Serverless Express users closer together with easy ways to use both platforms in combination.</p><p>To all the existing (and future) Serverless Express users, we look forward to making your experience even better. To all the project contributors, we look forward to being great partners, building on your existing contributions and successes in this project. And to AWS, a huge “Thank You” for believing in this idea back when it felt risky and uncertain,and for allowing it to leave the nest now that it’s grown. Stay tuned for more technical and project roadmap details coming soon...and <em>Go Serverless!</em></p><p>Tim Wagner, Vendia CEO (and former AWS Lambda General Manager) &amp;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="feature-flags-and-ephemeral-environments">Feature Flags and Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>Feature Flags are a necessary and ubiquitous part of modern software development.  As your company and the complexity of your application grows it becomes imperative to be able to control what features are available to your internal development teams, stakeholders and customers.  In the long-ago, before-times, we would just have a variable that you would toggle between true and false to control behavior of your application.  However, as application development transitioned to the Web we needed the same kind of control, except that hard-coded feature flags just weren’t going to cut it. Enter Dynamic Feature Flags!</p><p>Dynamic feature flags were a big improvement over static feature flags, but also added complexity and presented challenges different from static feature flags.  Gone were hard-coded flags, but they were replaced with if statements and more importantly, retrieving the appropriate flags for your application.  Most people started by rolling their own, but as developing with feature flags gained popularity many different companies popped into existence looking to solve the problems of:</p><ul><li>One interface to manage your flags</li><li>Easy maintenance of your flags</li><li>Very fast and reliable retrieval of your flags</li><li>Splitting traffic to one feature or another </li></ul><p>While companies like LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, Rollout, Split.io and others made it fairly easy to create and manage these flags this doesn’t solve all of your issues.  Many software orgs, especially as they grow, need lots of environments for testing. This poses a challenge to your Feature Flag setup specifically if your environments are ephemeral.</p><p>Ephemeral environments are like any environment except they will be removed in a relatively short amount of time unlike your staging or production environments.  Good examples are:</p><ul><li>Feature branches</li><li>Sales Demos</li><li>Load Testing</li><li>Refactors</li></ul><p>These environments may not last a long time, but they are exceedingly important and can be just as complex as production.  While a sales demo environment may be able to function with seed data, a load testing environment will need production or production-like data and many replicas of each service to give a valid result.  These can be super complex to create and manage and their ephemeral nature can play havoc with your feature flag setup.</p><h2 id="feature-flag-environments-to-the-rescuesort-of">Feature Flag Environments to the Rescue…Sort of</h2><p>LaunchDarkly (and others) recognized this issue and created the concept of environments in their own applications.  You can read about their implementation here.  They have apis that allow you to create and manipulate these sets of feature flags on an environment by environment basis. This works great if you have a finite set of environments and the set of them doesn’t change often, but with ephemeral environments the ability to spin them up and down is a feature not a bug.</p><p>In order to simplify this issue most people create two kinds of environments in their favorite Feature Flag provider: one for development (or test) and one for production.  In larger organizations development teams may have a few, such as development, test, uat, staging, and production.  This works fine as long as you don’t want to add another one or you never take the plunge toward truly ephemeral application environments.  </p><p>Once you move to ephemeral environments most people take the shortcut of assigning every ephemeral environment to a single Feature Flag environment, which is simple enough, but creates a large problem with people stepping on each other’s toes.  </p><p>Imagine you have 10 environments all pointing to a single database with writes happening from all those environments: it’s the same issue here.  The great thing about feature flags is the ability to toggle them and see different behavior, but if every environment is pointing to the same one you now have another resource contention problem.  If you toggle Feature A ‘on’ what’s to stop your co-worker from toggling it ‘off’?  Any issues you have with permanent staging environments are magnified with ephemeral environments.</p><p>The best solution would be upon the creation of an ephemeral environment you would create an environment in LaunchDarkly based on something unique about your ephemeral environment and when it comes up, you would make sure it was using the unique SDK api for that particular Feature Flag Environment.  Let’s implement the workflow and see how that would work with Release!</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/6iJFF3Zu70PwOxkxXCKtp3/24f7412df0886df79f4ff1239d1eeffc/image9.png" alt="FF workflow"></p><h2 id="working-with-ephemeral-environments">Working with Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>In order to try this out with Release we need a repository with a Docker File that has implemented Feature Flags with LaunchDarkly.  I’m going to use <a href="https://github.com/elanderholm/rails_postgres_redis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> repository on Github and you can do the same by first forking the repository so you can use it to create an application with Release.</p><p>Once you have forked the repository you can navigate to <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">releaseapp.io </a>and sign-in using github in order to follow along with this example.</p><p>The steps to get our ephemeral environments created in Release with support for environments in LaunchDarkly are:</p><ol><li>Create our application in Release</li><li>Create a job with Release to create the environment in LaunchDarkly</li><li>Add some environment variables so the application can contact LaunchDarkly and pull in the SDK Api key from our newly created LaunchDarkly Environment</li><li>Deploy our Ephemeral Environment</li></ol><blockquote><p>If you don’t have a launch darkly account, you can create one for free for 30 days to use for this example.  You will also need to create at least one feature flag.  If you already have a launch darkly account with a lot of feature flags you can just skip this step.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/4O6rr31peejXL43aLTPrAi/dc7022076bd7b28e2e189431a5262c7b/image3.png" alt="LaunchDarkly Test Flag"></p><h2 id="create-the-application-in-release">Create the Application In Release</h2><p>Once we are logged into Release we want to click <strong>Create New Application</strong> in the left-hand sidebar.

We also need to create a job that will create our LaunchDarkly environment upon initial environment deployment.  Jobs in Release are described in detail <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.  The TL;DR is that with a small amount of configuration you can run any arbitrary script or task in a container.  For example, these jobs are very useful for running migrations before a deployment of your backend service.  In this case we will run a rake task to set up our LaunchDarkly Environment.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>- name: create-launch-darkly-env</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  from_services: api</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  args:</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  - bundle</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  - exec</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  - rake</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  - launch_darkly:create_environment</span></p></pre></div><blockquote><p>The above yaml represents a job in Release</p></blockquote><p>We will place the above lines right before the “services” stanza in our application template.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>memory:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   limits: 1Gi</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>   requests: 100Mi</span></p><p><span>4</span><span> replicas: 1</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  - name: create-launch-darkly-env</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    from_services: api</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    args:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    - bundle</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>    - exec</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>    - rake</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    - launch_darkly:create_environment</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>services:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  - name: api</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    image: erik-opsnuts-test-001/rails_postgres_redis/api</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    has_repo: true</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    static: false</span></p></pre></div><blockquote><p>Place the jobs snippet into the Application Template</p></blockquote><p>In order for Release to utilize this job as part of the workflow to deploy an environment we will need to add one line near the bottom of the file in the ‘workflows` section.

Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#example">Prisma schema</a> – a declarative data model definition that codifies your database schema.</p><p>This Preview release is the evolution of the Experimental version of Migrate that we released last year. Since then, we've been gathering feedback from the community and incorporating it into Prisma Migrate.</p><h3 id="making-schema-migrations-predictable"><a href="#making-schema-migrations-predictable" aria-label="making schema migrations predictable permalink"></a>Making schema migrations predictable</h3><p>Database schema migrations play a crucial role in software development workflows and affect the most critical component in your application – the database. We've built Migrate to be predictable while allowing you to control how database schema changes are carried out.</p><p>Prisma Migrate generates migrations as plain SQL files based on changes in your Prisma schema. These SQL files are fully customizable and allow you to use any feature of the underlying database, such as manipulating data supporting a migration, setting up triggers, stored procedures, and views.</p><p>Prisma Migrate treads the balance between productivity and control by automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of writing database migrations while giving you the final say over how they are executed.</p><h3 id="integration-with-prisma-client"><a href="#integration-with-prisma-client" aria-label="integration with prisma client permalink"></a>Integration with Prisma Client</h3><p>Prisma Migrate integrates with Prisma Client using the Prisma schema as their shared source of truth. In other words, both Prisma Client and migrations are generated based on the Prisma schema. This makes synchronizing and verifying database schema changes in your application code easier by leveraging Prisma Client's type safety.</p><h3 id="prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing"><a href="#prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing" aria-label="prisma migrate is ready for broader testing permalink"></a>Prisma Migrate is ready for broader testing</h3><p>Prisma Migrate has passed rigorous testing internally and is now ready for broader testing by the community. You can use it with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. <strong>However, as a Preview feature, it is not fully production-ready yet.</strong> To read more about what Preview means, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/releases#preview">maturity levels</a> in the Prisma docs.</p><p>Thus, we're inviting you to try it out and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4531">give us feedback</a> so we can bring Prisma Migrate to General Availability. 🚢</p><p>Your feedback and suggestions will help us shape the future of Prisma Migrate. 🙌</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-prisma-migrate-work"><a href="#how-does-prisma-migrate-work" aria-label="how does prisma migrate work permalink"></a>How does Prisma Migrate work?</h2><p>Prisma Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> and works by generating <code>.sql</code> migration files that are executed against your database.</p><p>The Prisma schema is the starting point for schema migrations and provides an overview of your desired end-state of the database. Prisma Migrate inspects changes in the Prisma schema and generates the necessary <code>.sql</code> migration files to apply.</p><p>Applying migrations looks very different depending on the stage of development. For example, during development, there are scenarios where resetting the database can be tolerated for quicker prototyping, while in production, great care must be taken to avoid data loss and breaking changes.</p><p>Prisma Migrate accommodates for this with workflows for local development and applying migrations in production.</p><h3 id="evolving-the-schema-in-development"><a href="#evolving-the-schema-in-development" aria-label="evolving the schema in development permalink"></a>Evolving the schema in development</h3><p>To use the new version of Prisma Migrate, you should have at least version <code>2.13.0</code> of the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation"><code>@prisma/cli</code></a> package installed.</p><p>During development, you first define the Prisma schema and then run the <code>prisma migrate dev --preview-feature</code> command, which generates the migration, applies it, and generates Prisma Client:</p><p><span><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9dee8cc50b930a017447904d95e15e0e82f9a3bf/426d4/blog/posts/2020-12-migrate-development-workflow.png" alt="Development workflow"><span>Development workflow</span></span></p><p>Here is an example showing it in action:</p><p><strong>1.

In other words, the exact steps of the migration are determined when the migration is created, allowing you to inspect the SQL (and make changes if necessary) before running.</p><p>This approach has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The generated SQL is editable, thereby allowing you to control the exact schema changes.</li><li>The migration is predictable with the exact SQL that will be applied.</li><li>You don't need to write SQL unless you want to change a migration.</li><li>You can perform data migrations using SQL as part of a migration.</li></ul><p>Editable SQL for migrations is useful in scenarios where there are multiple ways to map changes in the Prisma schema to the database, and the desired path cannot be automatically determined.</p><p>For example, when you rename a field in the Prisma schema, that can be interpreted as either deleting the column and adding an unrelated new one or as you renaming the column. By allowing you to inspect and edit the migration SQL, you can decide whether to rename the column (and retain the data in the column) or drop it and add a new one.</p><p>If you're upgrading Prisma Migrate from the Experimental version, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/prisma-guides/prisma-migrate-guides/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project">upgrade guide</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="whats next permalink"></a>What's next</h2><p>This Preview version of Prisma Migrate lays the foundations for the upcoming General Availability release.

                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I'm a full stack engineer who works almost exclusively on Macs. I don't have a computer science degree nor do I have strong experience with Linux architecture. This post documents my journey of learning Docker.</p>



<p><strong>If you stick with this blog post, you'll have decent answers for the following questions.</strong> If you've already used Docker, these questions will strengthen your understanding.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is "Docker"?  </li>
<li>What is a "container"? Did Docker invent containers?  </li>
<li>What does it mean to "run a container"?  </li>
<li>Are containers stateful? What does container state even mean?  </li>
<li>Do containers run only one process? Or can they run multiple processes?  </li>
<li>What exactly is "Docker for Mac"? I thought Docker was cross platform?  </li>
<li>Does Docker work for Windows development?  </li>
<li>What are "docker-compose" and "BuildKit"? Why are there so many different applications?  </li>
<li>Most Docker images start with something like <code>FROM ubuntu</code>. Is my container running a full Ubuntu operating system? If not, why is it <em>from</em> Ubuntu? In fact, what does it even mean to "run an operating system?"</li>
</ol>

<p>The summarized answers for all of these questions are at the end of this post.</p>



<p>How might you <a href="https://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people/">explain React.js</a> to a newcomer? You <em>could</em> say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think this would help a newcomer form a mental model of React, as it's <strong>too high level</strong>. You could also say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is a declarative DSL that outputs a tree-like "virtual DOM," mutating the DOM (or another view target) with O(n) reconciliation performance, as a pure function of component state and props</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think, justifiably, the newcomer would slap you in the face, because you just told them to go to hell.</p>

<p>Something more approachable is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is mainly a Javascript library that takes in data, like a username, and spits out HTML based on that data. It gives you a performant way to update the view in real time based on changes to that data. React can do a lot more than this, but the most common use case is taking in data and spitting out HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this accurately describe all of React? No, and once someone dives in, they'll have to learn the intricacies of the API. But it's more <strong>approachable.</strong></p>

<p>I find the Docker documentation is written by, and targeted to, people who already have a deeper understanding of Linux fundamentals, virtualization, and kernels versus operating systems.</p>

<p>If someone tells you that Docker is "cgroups and namespaces" with no other information, it's technically accurate, but not approachable.</p>



<p>If you just want to build web servers, why care about Docker at all? Well, I've personally encountered many of the issues containers claim to solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requiring multiple versions of <strong>userland libraries</strong> (like Node, and also npm packages) in different repositories, causing conflicts for local development because they aren't isolated</li>
<li>Requiring <strong>multiple service or database versions</strong> causing conflict in local development (have you ever tried to run two versions of MySQL on a Mac using Homebrew?)</li>
<li>Running into <strong>dependency installation issues</strong> when checking out both old and new projects (Ruby / Rails are particularly bad at this, damn you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/33996523/743464">Nokogiri</a>). Who hasn't run an old project only to learn everything is broken?</li>
<li>Needing to <strong>easily run multiple services</strong> for local development, some of which need multiple commands (such as both a server process and a static file builder process like Webpack)</li>
<li>Losing <strong>parity between environments</strong> due to version or process execution discrepancies, making it impossible to reproduce situations that cause some production bugs</li>
</ul>



<p>This post <strong>isn't</strong> a deep dive on Docker's API. We won't explain the syntax of <code>Dockerfile</code>s, <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files, nor the CLI. We also won't talk much about "orchestration," the verb used to describe running multiple containers and their dependencies and dealing with things like networking and automatically restarting containers.</p>



<h4 id="whatisdocker">What is Docker?</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, let's start with the Docker logo. It's great for our mental model!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2020/05/Moby-logo.png" alt="The Docker Logo, which is a whale with a stack of shipping containers on its back"></p>

<p>We have a whale carrying some shipping containers. (His name is "Moby Dock," <strong>Moby</strong> for short). He's a whale because, a long time ago, he beat out other animals in <a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/create-cool-open-source-project-logo-219415/entries">a community logo design contest</a>.</p>

<p>In our mental model, the whale is Docker. <strong>Docker is a <em>platform</em>.</strong> It's not one thing, it's a collection of different technologies and standards that provide a platform to <strong>run containers!</strong> The whale is supporting, or "running" containers. We'll learn more about "containers" soon.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2014/Oct/key.png#inline-block" alt="Key icon" title=""> <strong>Key concept:</strong> Docker is a platform, including online hosting, and a suite of local tools, like <code>docker-compose</code> and the Docker engine.</p>

<p>When learning Docker, you might wonder what the "right" or "Docker" way is. By viewing Docker as a platform, we realize there are multiple ways to do things. <strong>It's like Git:</strong> Git is a platform and suite of command line tools. In Git there are different ways to use the suite of tools. Some people use forks, some use feature branches, some use rebasing, some use merging. Docker provides you tools to build "images" and "run" "containers," with multiple ways to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>"Docker" also means the <strong>company.</strong> I think this overloading makes learning Docker confusing. The Docker <em>platform</em> is <a href="https://github.com/docker">entirely open source</a>, so what does the company do? It makes money by <a href="https://hub.docker.com/pricing">charging for private hosting and management tools</a>, and offering <a href="https://hub.docker.com/pricing">enterprise services</a> for complex image/container management.</p>

<p>An aside: In 2019 Docker was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/">acquired</a> by a company named <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/software/mcp/">Mirantis</a> which makes money by supporting cloud application development around Kubernetes.</p>



<h4 id="whatisacontainerdiddockerinventcontainers">What is a "container"? Did Docker invent containers?</h4>

<p>Containers were the most difficult part of Docker for me to understand. I had some idea they were running a process in isolation, but I didn't really know what that meant. To answer this, let's make sure we understand the Docker platform by looking at a different question.</p>

<h4 id="whatexactlyisdockerformacithoughtdockerworkedonallplatforms">What exactly is "Docker for Mac?" I thought Docker worked on all platforms?</h4>

<p>I initially thought Docker was "cross platform." This is both true and a complete, filthy lie.</p>

<p>Take Docker for Mac out of the equation and pretend like you're developing directly on a Linux operating system, like Ubuntu. All operating systems have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)"><strong>kernel</strong></a>", the core computer program of the operating system that controls everything and facilitates access to hardware.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel has features that allow you to run processes (computer programs) in "isolation":</p>

<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/ch01">Control groups</a>", usually called "cgroups," let you run a Linux process with a specifically allocated set of resources, such as how much memory it has.</li>
<li>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">Namespaces</a>", which add additional isolation, like making your process look like it's the only one on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2014/Oct/key.png#inline-block" alt="Key icon" title=""> <strong>Key concept:</strong>
Docker uses existing Linux features to run containers. These features <strong>only</strong> work on Linux. MacOS and Windows don't have cgroups nor namespaces.</p>

<p>So what is Docker for Mac, if these technologies only exist on Linux? Docker for Mac runs a full <strong>Linux "virtual machine."</strong> Virtual machines are a broader topic, but they contain full operating systems, including kernels, so we have access to these Linux features.</p>

<p>My mental image is the whale icon on my Mac's status bar holds a little Linux computer.</p>

<p>This also has the implication that the most common type of application developed with Docker is an application <em>for</em> Linux. For example, you <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/607443/can-mac-os-x-be-run-inside-docker">can't run a Mac native application</a> like Photoshop in a Docker container. On Windows there's Docker container support for both Windows (.exe) applications as well as Linux applications, but they use different underlying technologies. And you can't run a Windows container on a Mac. See what I mean about Docker not really being "cross platform"?</p>

<p>On Mac and Windows, the Linux virtual machine is hidden from you as an implementation detail. You can typically SSH into computers and run commands on them. Docker for Mac <strong>doesn't let you directly SSH into this virtual machine.</strong> Instead, the Docker commands you run locally are what coordinate sending files and commands into this Linux virtual machine.</p>

<p>Finally, did Docker invent containers? No, containers are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_containers">general concept</a>. <strong>Docker didn't invent containers.</strong> You can create and run containers <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/26/running-container-without-docker/">without Docker</a>. Cgroups and namespaces also aren't the only way to run processes in isolation, they're just the tools Docker uses.</p>

<h4 id="sodoesdockerworkonwindows">So does Docker work on Windows?</h4>

<p>The <a href="" windows="" container"="" https:="" www.youtube.com="" watch?v="8gG6_Xr68D8" are="" the"="">official Docker Enterprise video, at 0:45,</a> mentions "Windows containers." So you <em>can</em> use Docker on Windows?</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by "use on Windows." If you're developing Linux applications, then <strong>Docker for Windows does the same thing as Docker for Mac,</strong> it runs a Linux virtual machine, and you communicate with that.</p>

<p>If however you want to develop an application that only runs on Windows, like a file ending in ".exe," you have to run your containers on a Windows host somehow. This is supported by Docker Enterprise, but much less common.</p>

<h4 id="whatdoesitmeantorunacontainer">What does it mean to "run a container"?</h4>

<p>"Container" is a noun. What we've talked about so far is the verb of "running" a container.</p>

<p><strong>Recap:</strong> When Docker runs your container, it starts your process (your computer program, developed for Linux architecture) wrapped in suite of Linux kernel tools to make it look like it's the only process on the system. Docker for Mac (and Windows) provide a Linux virtual machine so you can use these technologies. Running the container is basically the same as what you'd do on your host machine (like <code>npm start</code> or <code>rails s</code>), it's just in "isolation" inside the Linux VM.</p>

<p>Let's poke at containers a little more to strengthen our understanding.</p>

<h4 id="docontainershave_only_oneprocessorcantheyhavemultipleprocesses">Do containers have <em>only</em> one process? Or can they have multiple processes?</h4>

<p>Let's check! First let's install <code>htop</code>, the awesome process viewer on your Mac (not in a container): <code>brew install htop</code>.</p>

<p>Now run <code>htop</code> on your Mac. If you haven't used <code>htop</code>, don't worry too much about the interface, just note you see all sorts of processes running:</p>

          <h2 id="changing-license-from-gplv3-to-apache-20-terminusdb">Changing License from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0: TerminusDB</h2>

<p>We have decided to re-license TerminusDB from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0. We want independent software developers (ISVs) to embed TerminusDB in their applications and those developers feel that Apache is a lower risk option. The substantive points of practical difference are far less important – sufficient people believe it to be true and sufficient lawyers have advised teams to be wary of GPL.</p>

<p>In our experience, ISVs and devs in large companies/institutions size up their options at project conception and there remains a niggling doubt that ‘GPL might limit commercial prospects and cause me headaches’. The world has changed – and code freedom is being overtaken by developer freedom.</p>

<p>Open-source software is everywhere. It’s eating the world. In the top 10 databases on <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">DB-Engines</a>, the remaining proprietary databases were released in 1980 (Oracle), 1983 (IBM Db2) and 1989 (Microsoft SQL Server). It is hard to imagine another non-OSS database ever entering the top 10.</p>

<p>We had hoped that our association with the principals of the free software movement would result in community adoption and contribution, but that hasn’t really been the case. We see limited community input that relates to our choice of GPL. That might not be too surprising as when you investigate which license to choose on Stackoverflow, you get popular but wrong-headed comments like:</p>

<p><code>the GNU/GPL bunch are generally extremists when you encounter them in the wild.</code></p>

<p><code>don’t use GPL if you want your project to be commercial</code></p>

<p>With the shift to Apache, TerminusDB is, in a sense, becoming more open source as we are removing restrictions on how you can use the software.</p>

<h3 id="debate">Debate</h3>

<p>The core TerminusDB team had a long debate about licenses before the release of 1.0 last year. The main topics of discussion were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The risks of a cloud provider forking the code then hosting the database</li>
<li>What open source means to TerminusDB as a group</li>
<li>What we, as a community of devs and users, are most comfortable with</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-the-big-bad-cloud-providers">1. The big bad cloud providers</h4>

<p>In the past there was an unwritten rule, that big platforms wouldn’t come along and fork open source code and deliver the same product as a service. Unfortunately, those days are gone. AWS in particular has actively sought to offer very similar services to open source products. This led to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/">Confluent</a> (among others) changing their licences to variations of ‘server side’ and moving away from the open-source tradition. They try to say ‘we are still open source, we are just forbidding a specific type of action’, but it can feel like window dressing for ‘we want to sweat our assets’.</p>

<p>Mongo, for example, is hardly suffering – it’s valued at over $15 billion. With such vast resources, they should be (and are) able to compete in the provision of their own database. MongoDB’s technology is more than competitive with AWS’ DocumentDB, and Mongo’s Atlas DBaaS - which runs on AWS infra - has been a huge success.</p>

<p>I’m sure our perspective will shift over time, but from where we’re standing, having a cloud provider launch a competing service would be a sign of enormous success. (And this is not to say that the cloud providers’ parasitic approach to OSS projects is not a genuine problem, it simply acknowledges that you have to be a widely used OSS project before it *becomes* a problem).</p>

<h3 id="2-free-software">2. Free software</h3>

<p>We don’t think it should be our job to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We do think that the software community should be able to access and use TerminusDB.</p>

<p>In 1974 software became copyrightable in the USA. It subsequently became obvious that researchers were giving out software for free, but businesses were not giving back. GNU/GPL came along to provide a new framework for that interface – the software would be free as in freedom (libre). Everybody would be free to modify and distribute, but proprietary additions would not be allowed.</p>

<p>The problem of businesses not giving back remains today.</p>

<p>GPL and copyleft provisions work well when they dominate open-source, but their waning popularity increases the ability for ISVs and corporates to go for more open licensing and for legal teams to write anti-GPL provisions into internal rules. Only significant developer push back can change that reality (and why push back when there are so many OSS options with permissive licenses).</p>

<p>Maybe if <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MySQL">MySQL</a>, its offshoot <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MariaDB">MariaDB</a>, and our graph brothers <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/Neo4j">Neo4j</a> weren’t the only GPL flag flyers in the top 20 databases, it might be easier to gain adoption with GPL; however, the other big OSS players: Postgres, Cassandra, Elastic &amp; Redis all go for less restrictive licenses.</p>

<p>The Affero GPL (AGPL) is treated as an even greater pariah than the GPLv3. The Google internal policy] bans all use of AGPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It reminds of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13421608">this HN comment</a> on the <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">excellent postmortem</a> of the demise of RethinkDB (recommended reading for all OSS folk):</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-hn.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Our graph database brothers and sisters in <a href="https://neo4j.com/open-core-and-neo4j/">Neo4j moved</a> from the AGPL to ‘AGPL with a commons clause’ to GPLv3 to making some of the code proprietary. Getting the right license for an OSS project that also allows for some commercialization is far from straightforward. (As Neo certainly know – check out this <a href="https://public.igovsol.com/neo4j-court-records/graphfoundation/80-main.pdf">current court case about the formerly GPL enterprise code</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn">Grakn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree/db">Fluree</a> are seeing some success with the AGPL. We genuinely wish them well as we know it is a hard path to walk.</p>



<p>We did get some negative feedback about the GPL prior to launch. Some people working in corporates weren’t comfortable and thought that it would prevent them from using Terminus. Our response was – <strong>we didn’t develop for them</strong>. And that remains the case; however, the GPL skeptical environment is pervasive. There is a person who tweets TerminusDB after every release asking when the Apache version will land – I always ask him why he thinks he needs an Apache version and he doesn’t really know… though he has a vague feeling that the application he builds on top will be less valuable.</p>

<p>We thought we would focus on the cloud offering – <a href="https://terminusdb.com/hub/">TerminusHub</a>, which, as SaaS built on the database, has the benefit of being an in-house ‘product’ that doesn’t worry about the license of the underlying software. However, the community wants to build applications on the software and we want to offer an easy way to build a version control and collaboration layer into ISV applications. We think TerminusDB is the perfect infrastructure to build the next <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. We worry about the syncing, versioning and data collaboration – you worry about your users.</p>

<h3 id="why-shift-licenses">Why shift Licenses</h3>

<p>We do not think that our job is to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We still believe that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">“the fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs.”</a></p>

<p>We would welcome a GPL fork of the TerminusDB code – we are happy to work with any such project should it emerge.</p>

<p>But we wish to build a community first and foremost. In order to facilitate that community, we will be moving to Apache 2.0 immediately.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to focus on creating a great open-source database and allow everybody to use that software in their projects.</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This post is co-authored by George Fraser, the CEO of <a href="http://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a>, and Arjun Narayan, the CEO of Materialize. This blog post is cross-posted <a href="https://fivetran.com/blog/kafka-is-not-a-database">on the Fivetran blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s important to understand the uses and abuses of streaming infrastructure.</p>
<p>Apache Kafka is a message broker that has rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years. Message brokers have been around for a long time; they’re a type of datastore specialized for “buffering” messages between producer and consumer systems. Kafka has become popular because it’s open-source and capable of scaling to very large numbers of messages.</p>
<p>Message brokers are classically used to decouple producers and consumers of data. For example, at Fivetran, we use a message broker similar to Kafka to buffer customer-generated webhooks before loading them in batches into your data warehouse:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" alt="A Message Broker Used as a buffer before loading into a data warehouse" width="960" height="124" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w"></p>
<p>In this scenario, the message broker is providing durable storage of events between when a customer sends them, and when Fivetran loads them into the data warehouse.</p>
<p>However, Kafka has occasionally been described as something much more than just a better message broker. Proponents of this viewpoint position Kafka as a fundamentally new way of managing data, where <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka replaces the relational database as the definitive record of what has happened</a>. Instead of reading and writing a traditional database, you append events to Kafka, and read from downstream views that represent the present state. This architecture has been described as “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning the database inside out</a>“.</p>
<p>In principle, it is possible to implement this architecture in a way that supports both reads and writes. However, during that process you will eventually confront every hard problem that database management systems have faced for decades. You will more or less have to write a full-fledged DBMS in your application code. And you will probably not do a great job, because databases take years to get right. You will have to deal with dirty reads, phantom reads, write skew, and all the other symptoms of a hastily implemented database.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with using Kafka as your primary data store is it provides no isolation. Isolation means that, globally, all transactions (reads and writes) occur along some consistent history. Jepsen provides a <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">guide</a> of isolation levels (inhabiting an isolation level means that the system will never encounter certain anomalies).</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example of why isolation is important: suppose we’re running an online store. When a user checks out, we want to make sure all their items are actually in stock. The way to do this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the inventory level for each item in the user’s cart.</li>
<li>If an item is no longer available, abort the checkout.</li>
<li>If all items are available, subtract them from the inventory and confirm the checkout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we are using Kafka to manage this process. Our architecture might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" alt="A microservice workflow for processing checkouts" width="960" height="753" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w"></p>
<p>The web server reads the inventory level from a view downstream from Kafka, but it can only commit the transaction <em>upstream</em> in the checkouts topic. The problem is one of <strong>concurrency control</strong>: if there are two users racing to buy the last item, <em>only one must succeed</em>. We need to read the inventory view and confirm the checkout at <em>a single point in time</em>. However, there is no way to do this in this architecture.</p>
<p>The problem we now have is called <a href="http://justinjaffray.com/what-does-write-skew-look-like/">write skew</a>. Our reads from the inventory view can be out of date by the time the checkout event is processed. If two users try to buy the same item at nearly the same time, they will both succeed, and we won’t have enough inventory for them both.</p>
<p>Event-sourced architectures like these suffer many such isolation anomalies, which constantly gaslight users with “time travel” behavior that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unread+notification+glitch">we’re all familiar with</a>. Even worse, research shows that anomaly-permitting architectures create outright security holes that allow hackers to steal data, as covered in <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/acid-rain/">this excellent blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/acidrain-sigmod2017.pdf">this research paper.</a></p>

<p>These problems can be avoided if you use Kafka as a <em>complement</em> to a traditional database:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" alt="kafka used for Change Data Capture from an OLTP database" width="960" height="658" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w"></p>
<p>OLTP databases perform a crucial task that message brokers are not well suited to provide: admission control of events. Rather than using a message broker as a receptacle for “fire and forget” events, forcing your event schema into an “intent pattern”, an OLTP database can <em>deny</em> events that conflict, ensuring that only a single consistent stream of events are ever emitted. OLTP databases are really good at this core <strong>concurrency control</strong> task – scaling to many millions of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Using a database as the point-of-entry for writes, the best way to extract events from a database is via streaming <strong>change-data-capture</strong>. There are several great open CDC frameworks like <a href="http://debezium.io/">Debezium</a> and <a href="http://maxwells-daemon.io/">Maxwell</a>, as well as native CDC from <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/change-data-capture.html">modern</a> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28313/cdc.htm">SQL</a> <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/architecture/docdb-replication/change-data-capture/">databases</a>. Change-data-capture also sets up an elegant operational story. In recovery scenarios, everything can be purged downstream and rebuilt from the (very durable) OLTP database.</p>

<p>The database community has learned (and re-learned) several important lessons over decades. Each one of these lessons was obtained at the high prices of data corruption, data loss, and numerous user-facing anomalies. The last thing you want to do is to find yourself relearning these lessons because you <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491944608/video244677.html">accidentally misbuilt a database</a>.</p>
<p>Real-time streaming message brokers are a great tool for managing high-velocity data. But you will still need a traditional DBMS for isolating transactions. The best reference architecture for “turning your database inside out” is to use OLTP databases for admission control, use CDC for event generation, and model downstream copies of the data as materialized views.</p>

    <h2>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Ard<br>}</h2><br>
  <h2>Little Tasks, Little Trust</h2>
  <h3>How Delegating Responsibilities is Better Than Managing By Tasks</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Trust is the highest form of motivation. It brings out the very
    best in people.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    --Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It’s basically a sacred project management mantra by
now: <strong>divide your work into tasks that are as small as
possible</strong>. Estimate them with your team. Then drop them into
the all-knowing product backlog. But no one seems to be looking very
critically at how this practice has affected the software engineering
profession. Back in the 90’s, when I started programming, this was not
how it worked. It was, dare I say, a little more
professional.</p><p>Back then, your boss had a dozen or more things
they were responsible for and when you got hired they breathed a deep
sigh of relief.</p><p>“Finally, now that Vincent is here, I can make
him do A and B; and with Ted doing C, D, and E and Jan doing F, G, and
H, I can finally get to I, J, K, L, and M.”</p><p>Most importantly, A
and B were big things, like whole products or large system
libraries. Building and maintaining them consumed all of your
time. They were your delegated responsibilities, not mere tasks. It
wasn’t that hard to manage people this way either. If you weren’t
doing a good job, the boss would let you know.</p><p>“Hey, Vincent, A
isn’t turning out quite like I was imagining. Can you do a little more
of this — and definitely more cowbell.”</p><p>Then you went back to
your private office (I sure miss private offices, but that is a topic
for another day) and fixed a few things. Later, in a weekly status
meeting you would tell people how it went — yep, that’s right, no
daily stand-ups where you look mournfully at your shoes and admit that
you didn’t make any notable progress yet.</p><p>No backlog grooming
meetings or burn-down charts either. Your manager simply looked at
how <em>your </em>products were coming along. A little trust, some
accountability, and a healthy portion of “give me some space to do my
work.”</p><p>The way we work now is different. Sadly, it’s less
motivating, less efficient, and profoundly less respectful of
individual abilities.</p><h3>whose vision is it again?</h3><p>As I
see it, little tasks are born of a fundamentally different management
attitude. Small tasks are a not-so-subtle way of saying that all the
product vision lies with management. Keep away. Don’t
touch.</p><p>While larger tasks send a completely different
message. Here, management is giving you bigger pieces to chew on,
inviting you to mix some of your own creativity with the end
product. You get to do some design work, think about what the customer
needs, and take pride in what comes out the other end. Sure, the
organization has an overarching strategy, but they still want people
to take on responsibilities, not just errands. They trust you to align
with the overall vision and because you feel like you are part of the
“club”, you actually want to.</p><h3>too much love for the
metrics</h3><p>Small tasks have also taken hold because they fit
nicely with the age-old assembly-line mentality. Sadly, there are
armies of managers that still live by that dogma. For them, it is all
about picking <em>metrics and optimizing them </em>— management by
chart and graph.</p><p>Unfortunately, little tasks in Jira (or any of
the dozens of other issue tracking systems out there) bring the
promise of a whole host of tasty new charts and graphs: burn-down,
burn-up, velocity, lead-time, cycle time, task age, throughput, failed
deployment, flow and control. It’s as irresistible as candy to a
baby.</p><p>But, assigning responsibilities instead of tasks takes
away an assembly-line manager’s favorite tools. Because they are
larger, responsibilities can’t be so easily measured and tracked. So
metrics-managers will fight both tooth and nail to keep your work divided
and cataloged in tiny, traceable instructions.</p><h3>when will I get some design
experience?</h3><p>Sadly, as developers, we do it to ourselves as
well. Once someone gives us a better title, we are right on board with
the program. When a regular developer might have had a chance to do
some research or design, we immediately snatch it away for
ourselves.</p><p>As technical management, we standardize our
frameworks, languages, deployment operating systems, and cloud service
providers. We write wrappers around networking, logging, and
monitoring libraries and demand they always be used. Then, after we
have taken the task of designing and researching the CI/CD tools and
pipeline, we write coding standards for our coding
standards.</p><p>Worse yet, we design every product’s architecture,
and expect any deviation to be approved by us first. All that is left
are tiny morsels. Grunt work for the foot soldiers once the fun has
been stripped away.</p><p>Poor front-line programmers are left
wide-eyed with empty bowls, asking “please sir, can I have some more?
I just wanted to design one little service. I know I am not worthy,
but can I please just write my own sql queries without using that
awful ORM?  PLEASE?”</p><p>Sadly, when those poor programmers finally
seek promotion, hoping for their first real shot at higher level
engagement, they are rebuffed: “You don’t really have any design
experience I am afraid. We are looking for someone who has designed
large systems.”</p><p>To their managers they could rightfully reply,
“that was your doing, not mine!”</p><h3>estimation is never
free</h3><p>There is a grave misconception circulating that if you
just sit down, in a comfy conference room chair, and split a project
into tiny tasks, small enough to be individually estimated,
then when you add them up, Viola! You’ll have a accurate
estimate for the whole project! Easy peasy.</p><p>There are two
problems with this delusion. First, no task, even a small one,
is easy to estimate. I have seen many “tiny”, one-day tasks blow up
into week long campaigns. All because of hidden complexity that comes
popping out like a Pandora’s box once you start coding on
it.</p><p>Second, when you divide work into little tasks, before
actually working on any of them, you are making untested
assumptions. Many of them. The more tasks you define, the more facets
of a hypothetical design you must assume (implicitly of course, since
no one ever writes design assumptions in task descriptions). Soon,
you’ve created a long chain of design choices, all depending on
previous ones, sitting on sticky notes on the wall.</p><p>The problem
is, as soon as you start working on one of them, you will
realize that your implicit design decisions are wrong. Now, you will spend MUCH more time than was
previously estimated for this task and all other tasks that depend on
its faulty design are invalid. The whole house of cards comes
tumbling down. Time for another all-day backlog grooming session? What
a waste!</p><h3>conclusion</h3><p>Back in the day, before everyone
realized that software companies were positioned to make lots of
money, we had some elbow room. We had a lot of responsibility and the
ability to make a lot of decisions. But now, a lot more people have
piled onto the island. Unfortunately, some of them have slowly chipped
away at the domain of the software engineer. One by one, descending
from their vessels they planted their flags:</p><p>“I am Amerigo, the
product guy. Heretofore, no developer will make product decisions, for
they are mine.”</p><p>“And I am Ferdinand, process guy. Heretofore,
no developer will make process decisions, for they are
mine.”</p><p>“I Bartolomeu will enforce compliance.”</p><p>“I Vasco
used to be pretty good at Microsoft Access, I guess I’ll be the
database guy.”</p><p>One by one, until every responsibility that
wasn’t actual open-up-emacs-and-start-typing-stuff programming was
taken away, forbidden even. And then, the remaining, purely technical
tasks were carved up by architecture/standard hoarding engineers,
hungry for something of substance. Only dry, broken carcasses were
left scattered on the ground.</p><p>Of course, there is a solution to
this predicament — delegate <em>responsibilities</em> to everyone,
all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy. Or better yet,
flatten or abolish the hierarchy all together. But until that
happens, you’ll just have to content yourself with measly for-loops
and if-statements — following the coding standard of
course.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>F</span>eel-good moments are difficult to come by on Twitter in Pakistan. In between the political infighting and trolls, though, there was a brief moment where the ugliness the platform often brings out in people gave way to the app’s potential for humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, a Karachi school teacher, Aimun Faisal, tweeted questions from her students about space and space travel. “Do you get scared that your space shuttle might get lost?” one 10-year-old asked. Ms. Faisal tagged NASA and other space agencies in the post, encouraging readers to retweet it and bring it to their attention. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/nasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">It worked</a>.</p>



<p>A Canadian astronaut who has flown in a space shuttle twice replied that he wasn’t scared because Earth was nearby, and he could use the stars to find his way. “I felt especially comforted when I flew over home,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/1316390465277767682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1316390465277767682%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgulfnews.com%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fpakistan%2Fnasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">he tweeted</a>. “Here’s a photo I took of Karachi — can you find your school?”</p>



<p>It’s the kind of interaction that leads one to believe that perhaps all you need in life is a Twitter account and a heart that still beats. The media ate it up too: Ms. Faisal and her tweet were in all the major newspapers and even on TV. We were gushy over Ms. Faisal; we wished there were more teachers like her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, people were suggesting that Ms. Faisal should go jump into a river or move to another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It all turned after — what else? — a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One evening this past September, a woman set out in her car on a motorway outside Lahore, her two children in tow. Motorways in Pakistan are safer than most roads there; they have their own police, who have a reputation, unlike other police units, for being well-dressed and resistant to corruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That evening, the woman’s car ran out of fuel. She locked her car doors and made some phone calls, but the rescue service didn’t answer, and she couldn’t get through to her family. By now, it was past midnight. She made more calls and waited for a friend to come pick her up. While she waited, two men emerged from the darkness, broke her car window, and when she fought back, took her children into some nearby bushes. She scrambled to save them, and while she fought, she was gang-raped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the pre–social media age, if a rape story ever got more than a couple of column inches on the inside pages of a newspaper, the victim not only had asked for it but, by reporting it and making it public, was asking for something more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with the <em>Washington Post</em>, Pakistan’s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf (now absconded from the country) once said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/09/19/musharraf-denies-rape-comments/5f2e0d4c-5ff2-4273-81e5-878cd59a1744/">Pakistani women get themselves raped so they can get a Canadian visa</a>. He probably thought he was being funny or insightful. When his office denied his having said it, the <em>Post</em> made the audio public. You can hear one of his aides laughing in the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attitudes toward rape haven’t changed much since the Musharraf days, but there was something about the awfulness of a woman trapped with her children on a motorway at night that struck a chord with the Pakistani public. As the news rippled through Twitter, #LahoreMotorwayIncident became a trending hashtag. The details of the crime were so grotesque that, for a few days, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54186609">seemed the nation actually believed that rape was a crime</a> and that the woman hadn’t asked for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan’s traditional and social media go into this kind of outrage cycle when children get raped, or get raped and then killed, which happens more often than one can stomach. There was genuine fury across the country when a 7-year-old girl was raped, strangled, and left in a rubbish heap two years ago. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1439587">Her name was Zainab</a>. On Twitter and Facebook, users argued over whether her rapist and killer should be hanged in public, quartered, doused in acid, or just locked up for life.</p>



<p>After the motorway incident, the usual bloodlust was on display. There were calls for public hangings and for chopping up the culprits. Prime Minister Imran Khan even appeared on a TV interview saying <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/asia/imran-khan-chemical-castration-rapists-intl/index.html">he has been contemplating chemical castration as a punishment for such crimes</a>.</p>

<p>And while the Lahore rapists were still on the loose, the newly appointed Lahore police chief appeared on one of the nightly news shows during the wall-to-wall media coverage. In effect, he said he was surprised that a mother of two had decided to take the motorway when another road would have sufficed for her journey. And if she had to take the motorway, he went on to ask, couldn’t she at least have checked her gas tank?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, the teacher we had fawned over just weeks prior for her tweets about space travel, was outraged. On Twitter, she was one of many to demand the police chief’s resignation, tweeting in disgust at the craven responses to the news she and others were seeing, rhetorical questions as to why the woman had failed to prevent her own assault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In return, our beloved Ms. Faisal was met with a flood of insults; trolls suggested she leave Pakistan if she had a problem with it. Being stuck on the motorway without gas became an internet meme that small-time politicians and social media trolls lobbed at one another. Somewhere along the way, “Why didn’t she check her petrol tank before leaving her home?” replaced the original question: “What kind of beasts would rape a woman in front of her children?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did this horror morph into a meme? Does every one of us carry inside us a bit of General Musharraf, smirking while his aides giggle?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long before we had social media, Pakistan swam through its sea of miseries on the backs of jokes. The mausoleum of Pakistan’s longest-serving dictator, General Zia’ul Haq, is jokingly referred to as Jaws Square. Guess why? Because, after ruling over us for 11 years, he died in a plane crash, and only his teeth survived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jokes back then went viral before we ever began to call them “viral.” You would hear one about the dictator in Urdu in Karachi one day, and the next day in Peshawar, someone would tell you it in Pashto. Jokes eased us out of our terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now the jokes themselves have become the terror. You can make a joke about a dead dictator, or Osama bin Laden becoming fish food, but how do you laugh at a joke about a woman raped in front of her children on the side of the motorway in the dead of night? Jokes were meant to subvert the powerful, not kick the poor to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a brief moment, social media in Pakistan made it easy to laugh at despots and oppressors. They answered with troll farms, indoctrinating the youth to be subservient to power. Even in the midst of incidents so nauseating that they capture the attention of our fractured social media, the horrors of which seem undeniable, the trolls find ways to mock and belittle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, another shocking piece of news roiled Pakistan’s social media: A 4-year-old rape survivor told her gut-wrenching story in a video that went viral. It was so harrowing, I couldn’t bring myself to watch it, even for reporting purposes. In another video, also shared widely online, the doctor who treated her after the assault broke down crying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Twitter, it’s easy to find redemption in the narrative too. In the middle of the outrage cycle, social media made a hero of the policeman <a href="https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/11/14/pakistani-policeman-uses-own-daughter-as-bait-to-nab-rapists">who had found the girl’s rapist by enlisting his own daughter to lure him</a>. The rapist was killed in a police encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policeman and his underage daughter were forced to take this extreme step because there were no women officers in his district. The prime minister called to congratulate the man, and his daughter was awarded a million rupees as a prize along with a guaranteed college scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, who by now has endured a litany of abuses online, questioned the collective satisfaction on social media. As proud as we are of the police officer, she tweeted, the story said more about the country’s broken system than it did about heroism. “No police officer should be forced to risk his family to perform his duty,”<a href="https://twitter.com/bluemagicboxes/status/1327209635594588165"> she wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“Tum kabhi khush na hona,” someone tweeted back. “You’ll never be happy.”</p>

That way, he would be shipping out his products before carriers like FedEx — which he estimates ships 75% of Letterfolk’s packages — would be under the most strain.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>But on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, Galbraith got a call from his FedEx representative: through the holidays, FedEx would only pick up 110 Letterfolk packages per day — something that has never happened to Galbraith in the five years he’s been in business. It was a number that was calculated based on the average number of packages FedEx was picking up from Letterfolk per day in September, plus 10%. But thanks to his early Black Friday sale, Galbraith had a queue of 3,000 orders waiting to go out.</p>

<p>“It was like, ‘this is going to ruin us as a business,'” said Galbraith, whose company sells letterboards and other home decor. “We are being told that just to ship out our existing queue — without any other orders coming it — it would take us up until the holidays to get them out to customers.”</p>
<p>Carriers like FedEx and UPS have been warning for months to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-holiday-crunch-starts-early-with-more-packages-than-means-to-deliver-them-11603013401">expect holiday shipping delays</a>. But some retail executives, like Galbraith, say they were not given advanced notice by carriers that they could face package pickup limits this holiday. It’s an issue that’s affecting companies both big and small — the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-slaps-shipping-limits-on-gap-nike-to-manage-e-commerce-surge-11606926669">reported</a> last week that UPS had temporarily stopped accepting shipments from major retailers like Nike and Macy’s.</p>
<p>Some executives who spoke with Modern Retail said that they feel like their carriers did not give them enough advance notice before applying a limit, and are frustrated by the fact that limits seem to be arbitrarily applied. In the meantime, they’re scrambling to find often expensive alternatives, including renting their own trucks or trying to find space with other carriers.</p>
<p>Representatives from FedEx and UPS would not provide details to Modern Retail about how they calculate package pickup limits.</p>
<p>FedEx has been “proactively working with our customers to understand their expected volume,” a spokeswoman told Modern Retail, and said the company has been preparing for the holidays by hiring more than 70,000 seasonal workers this year, and for the first time, picking up packages seven days a week.</p>

<p>“<span>UPS</span>&nbsp;continues to work closely with our largest customers to steer volume to capacity and ensure the&nbsp;<span>UPS</span> network is reliable for all customers,” a UPS spokesman said. “Agreed upon strategies for our largest customers include shifting package volume away from the heaviest demand shipping days, fully utilizing weekend capacity, and aligning promotional strategies with capacity.”</p>
<p><strong>Making their own deliveries<br>
</strong>For the most part, UPS and FedEx first started imposing shipping limits after Black Friday. Helena Price Hambrecht, founder of aperitif brand Haus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/business/ecommerce-shipping-holiday-season.html?referringSource=articleShare">told the New York Times</a> that FedEx informed her that starting on Wednesday, its drivers would only pick up 500 packages from Haus per week day, through the holidays. FedEx however, did give Haus a larger cap on the weekends. In a follow-up email to Modern Retail, Price Hambrecht did not say exactly when FedEx informed her of the limit, only that “FedEx has been great about communicating changes to us as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>David Malka, chief sales officer of returns processing company goTRG — which works with major retailers like Target, Walmart and Lowe’s to process some of their returns — told Modern Retail that shipping limits of roughly 200 packages per day had been imposed at four of the company’s warehouses. Though he added that the company is getting “conflicting reports” from FedEx about what exactly the limit is at some facilities. Malka, like Gilbraith said that goTRG received no advanced notice from FedEx that package pickup limits would be applied.</p>
<p>The most immediate way that retailers are trying to deal with pickup limits imposed by UPS or FedEx is to redirect some shipments to another carrier. Shortly after Galbraith’s FedEx representative informed him of Letterfolk’s new limit, he immediately set up deliveries through UPS — something he said he hadn’t done previously because he had a good relationship with FedEx.</p>
<p>That’s helped Letterfolk get through some of the 3,000 order backlog, though its <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/pages/holiday-shipping-info">website is still advising customer</a>s that most orders placed during its Black Friday sale will ship within one to three business weeks. However, he said that it’s more expensive right now for Letterfolk to ship through UPS, because his company didn’t have time to negotiate discounted rates.</p>
<p>Some companies are setting up other contingency plans to ensure their packages get into customers hands more quickly. Price Hambrecht told Modern Retail that Haus will be relying on Ohi, a last-mile delivery provider, to deliver more of its packages in the Bay Area and Southern California.</p>
<p>Jay Sauceda, founder of Austin-based 3PL Sauceda Industries, said that his company rented its own truck for the first time for the holidays. Sauceda — which works with companies including apparel brand Rowing Blazers and bra startup Pepper — has yet to be hit with a package pickup per day limit. But if it does, the plan then is to load packages onto the truck and deliver them directly to a FedEx or UPS sorting facility.</p>
<p>Sauceda is also advising its customers to try and encourage customers to get orders in two to three days ahead of shipping cutoffs given by FedEx, UPS and other carriers to ensure packages arrive in time for Christmas and other key dates.</p>
<p>“[The carriers] are in a very unenviable position,” Sauceda said. “So the biggest thing that we are trying to do this year to try to take the tension off.”</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that FedEx has capped the number of Haus packages it will pick up at 500 per week day, not per day as previously stated.&nbsp;</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Observability pipelines have become critical infrastructure in the current technological landscape, which is why we've built <a href="https://vector.dev/">Vector</a> to provide extremely high throughput with the tiniest resource footprint we can manage (<a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a huge help here). But this is not enough in the real world: your observability pipeline needs to provide optimal performance and efficiency while <em>also</em> being a good infrastructure citizen and playing nicely with services like <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> and <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/clickhouse">Clickhouse</a>.</p><p>And so we're excited to announce that Vector version 0.11 includes support for <strong>Adaptive Request Concurrency</strong> (ARC) in all of its HTTP-based <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks">sinks</a>. This feature does away with static rate limits and automatically optimizes HTTP concurrency limits based on downstream service responses. The underlying <a href="#how-it-works">mechanism</a> is a feedback loop inspired by TCP congestion control algorithms.</p><h2>The lead-up</h2><p>One of the most common support questions we get about Vector involves logs like this:</p><div><div><pre><div><p><span>TRACE tower_limit::rate::service: rate limit exceeded, disabling service</span></p></div></pre></div></div><p>Users typically have two questions about this:</p><ol><li>What does it mean?</li><li>How can I fix it?</li></ol><p>The answer to the first question is simple: Vector has <em>internally</em> rate-limited processing to respect user-configured limits—<a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate_limit_duration_secs"><code>request.rate_limit_duration_secs</code></a>, <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate_limit_num"><code>request.rate_limit_num</code></a>, and <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#in_flight_limit"><code>request.in_flight_limit</code></a>—for that particular <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks">sink</a>. In other words, Vector has intentionally reduced performance to stay within static limits.</p><p>The answer to the second question—how to fix it—is more complex because it depends on a variety of factors that change over time (covered in more detail <a href="#the-second-problem-rate-limiting-is-not-a-panacea">below</a>). Telling the user to raise their limits would be irresponsible since we'd then risk overwhelming the downstream service and causing an outage; but not changing them could mean limiting performance in a dramatic way.</p><blockquote><p>"In one case, we found that rate limits were limiting performance by over 80%."</p></blockquote><p>The crux of the matter is that Vector's high throughput presents a major challenge for HTTP-based sinks like <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> because those services can't always handle event payloads as quickly as Vector can send them. And when data services are heavily interdependent—which is almost always!—letting Vector overhwelm one of them can lead to system-wide performance degradation or even cascading failures.</p><p>In versions of Vector prior to 0.11, you could address this problem by setting <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate-limits"><strong>rate limits</strong></a> on outbound HTTP traffic to downstream services. Rate limiting certainly <em>does</em> help prevent certain worst-case scenarios but customer feedback and our own internal QA has revealed that this approach also has deep limitations.</p><h2>The problem: rate limiting is not a panacea</h2><p>Rate limiting is nice to have as a fallback but it's a blunt instrument, a static half-solution to a dynamic problem. The core problem is that configuring your own rate limits locks you into a perpetual loop:</p><p><img src="https://vector.dev/img/rate-limiting-loop.png" alt="The rate limiting decision loop"></p><p>Within this vicious loop, you need to constantly avoid two outcomes:</p><ul><li>You set the limit too high and thus <strong>compromise system reliability</strong> by overwhelming your services. Time to lower the limit and re-assess.</li><li>You set the limit too low and <strong>waste resources</strong>. Your Elasticsearch cluster may be capable of handling more concurrency than you're providing—at least for now. Time to raise the limit and re-assess.</li></ul><p>Not only do you need to perform this balancing act on a per-sink basis and on each Vector instance—that may be a <em>lot</em> of application points in your system—but the optimal rate is an elusive target that shifts along with changes in a number of factors:</p><ul><li>The number of Vector instances currently sending traffic</li><li>The current capacity of downstream services</li><li>The volume of data you're currently sending</li></ul><p>These changes are especially pronounced in highly elastic environments, like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, that are essentially <em>designed</em> to let you tweak cluster topologies, configuration, and much more with very little friction, which compounds the problem.</p><p>And don't forget, of course, that this chasing-the-dragon decision loop has its own cognitive and operational costs.</p><h2>The solution: Adaptive Request Concurrency</h2><p>We feel strongly that Vector's <strong>Adaptive Request Concurrency</strong> (ARC) feature provides a qualitatively better path than rate limiting. With ARC <a href="#the-role-of-configuration">enabled</a> on any given sink, Vector determines the optimal network concurrency based on current environment conditions and continuously re-adjusts in light of new information.</p><p>Here's how that plays out in some example scenarios:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Change</th><th></th><th>Response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><em>You deploy more Vector instances</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector automatically redistributes HTTP throughput across both current and new instances</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>You scale up your Elasticsearch cluster</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector automatically increases concurrency to take full advantage of the new capacity</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>You scale your Elasticsearch cluster back down</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector lowers concurrency to avoid any risk of destabilizing the cluster (while still taking full of advantage of the now-decreased bandwidth)</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Your Elasticsearch cluster experiences a temporary outage</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector lowers concurrency dramatically and provides backpressure by <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#buffer">buffering</a> events</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With ARC, these scenarios require no human intervention. Vector quietly hums along making these decisions for you with a speed and granularity that rate limits simply cannot provide.</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>ARC in Vector is based on a decision-making process that’s fairly simple at a high level. When Vector POSTs data to downstream services via HTTP, it continuously keeps track of downstream service performance and uses that information to make precise concurrency decisions.</p><p>The diagram below shows Vector's decision chart:</p><p><img src="https://vector.dev/img/adaptive-concurrency.png" alt="The Adaptive Request Concurrency decision chart"></p><p>With ARC enabled, Vector watches for significant movements in two things: the round-trip time (RTT) of requests and HTTP response codes (failure vs. success).</p><ul><li>If the RTT is declining/constant and/or response codes are consistently successful (200-299), Vector sees 🟢 and increases the throughput linearly. This is the "additive increase" in AIMD.</li><li>If the RTT is increasing and/or response codes consistently indicate failure—codes like <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> and <code>503 Service Unavailable</code>—Vector sees 🟡 and exponentially decreases concurrency. This is the "multiplicative decrease" in AIMD.</li></ul><p>This decision tree is always active and Vector always "knows" what to do, even in extreme cases like total service failure.</p><h3>The role of configuration</h3><p>Vector never stops quietly making the linear up vs. exponential down decision in the background, and it works out of the box with zero configuration beyond enabling the feature, which is currently on an opt-in basis in version 0.11. You can enable ARC in an HTTP sink by setting the <a href="https://vector.dev/blog/adaptive-request-concurrency/request_concurrency"><code>request.concurrency</code></a> parameter to <code>adaptive</code>. Here's an example for a Clickhouse sink:</p><div><div><pre><div><p><span>[</span><span>sinks.clickhouse_internal</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"clickhouse"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>inputs</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"log_stream_1"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"log_stream_2"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>host</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"http://clickhouse-prod:8123"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"prod-log-data"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>request.concurrency</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"adaptive"</span></p></div></pre></div></div><p>There's also room for fine-tuning if you find yourself needing additional knobs:</p><ul><li><strong>Buffering</strong>. What happens when Vector needs to lower concurrency and thus throttle the output? What happens to data that needs to be sent later? Vector lets you choose between an on-disk and an in-memory <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#buffer">buffer</a> and to set a <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#max_size">max_size</a> for that buffer. The <code>memory</code> buffer is the default, which maximizes performance, but you can always choose <code>disk</code> if your use case requires stronger durability guarantees. As always, this can be configured on a per-sink basis.</li><li><strong>The adaptive concurrency algorithm itself</strong>. In general, you shouldn't need to adjust the algorithm, but in case you need to resort to that, there are three parameters available:<ul><li><code>decrease_ratio</code> — This determines how rapidly Vector lowers the limit in response to failures or higher latency.</li><li><code>ewma_alpha</code> — Vector uses an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past RTT measurements as a reference to compare with the current RTT. The <code>ewma_alpha</code> parameter determines how heavily new measurements are weighted compared to older ones.</li><li><code>rtt_threshold_ratio</code> — The minimal change in RTT necessary for the algorithm to respond and adjust concurrency; changes below that threshold are ignored.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The defaults should work just fine for these parameters in most cases, but we know that some scenarios may call for a highly targeted approach.</p><h2>How we built it</h2><p>The development process behind ARC was highly methodical and data-driven. To summarize:</p><ul><li>Customer feedback has pinpointed concurrency management as a pain point since very early in the life of Vector.</li><li>The initial foray in addressing the problem came in <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/rfcs/2020-04-06-1858-automatically-adjust-request-limits.md">RFC 1858</a>, which called for a qualitatively better option for users and <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/rfcs/2020-04-06-1858-automatically-adjust-request-limits.md#prior-art">gestured toward</a> some possible inspirations.</li><li>Our engineers ultimately opted for a solution deeply inspired by analogous work on the Netflix engineering team, which is beautifully summarized in the <a href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/performance-under-load-3e6fa9a60581">Performance Under Load</a> piece on their blog. Our respective approaches utilize an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_increase/multiplicative_decrease">additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease</a> (AIMD) algorithm inspired by TCP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control">congestion control</a> algorithms. We'll have a lot more to say about this here on the blog next week. If you want to see the in-depth discussion that drove this process, see GitHub <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues/3255">issue #3255</a> on the Vector repo. There you'll see a pretty epic back and forth within our engineering team along with a slew of visualizations. It's quite the read.</li><li>As Netflix is largely a Java shop and there was nothing immediately usable "off the shelf" in the Rust ecosystem, we needed to create our own Rust implementation, which you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/tree/master/src/sinks/util/adaptive_concurrency">adaptive_concurrency</a> module. Of special importance is the concurrency <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/src/sinks/util/adaptive_concurrency/controller.rs#L23-L31">Controller</a>, which is responsible for the linear up/exponential down decision that I alluded to above.</li><li>For testing, the team mostly relied on our in-house <a href="https://github.com/timberio/http_test_server">http_test_server</a>, a pretty straightforward but highly customizable HTTP server written in Go.</li></ul><p>It took several months, some hefty PRs, and even a handful of <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/pull/3671">dead ends</a>, but we think that both the process and the end result are wholly consistent with the fastidious approach we strive for in building Vector.</p><h2>More to come</h2><p>Next week, we'll follow up on this announcement with a post from Timber's <a href="https://github.com/bruceg">Bruce Guenter</a>…</p></section></div>

<p>Today we are excited to announce the launch of StackHawk’s free Developer Plan. With this launch, engineering teams or individual developers can take ownership of security in the development and delivery of their applications. Read on to learn a bit more about why we are so excited to launch this, or jump right in to <a href="https://auth.stackhawk.com/signup">sign up for a free account</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-application-security-s-new-paradigm">Application Security’s New Paradigm</h3>



<p>It is no secret that the speed of application delivery has rapidly accelerated over the past decade. Most companies are pushing to production several times per week, or even multiple times per day. Originally, security struggled to keep up, with the dated models of quarterly penetration tests or manual scans by security teams clearly <a href="https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/application-security-is-broken/">no longer cutting it</a>.</p>



<p>These legacy models were predicated on finding vulnerabilities in production, often awhile after code had been deployed. This is at best, inefficient, and at worst a security issue. Once a vulnerability was found, it then had to navigate internal silos to actually get a fix released.</p>



<p>Modern engineering teams, however, have not only accelerated delivery speed, but have also improved security in the process. Here is how.</p>



<h4 id="h-find-vulnerabilities-with-ci-cd-automation">Find Vulnerabilities with CI/CD Automation</h4>



<p>Companies using modern approaches check for security vulnerabilities on every pull request (or even every commit) in the same way that they run unit tests and integration tests. With automated testing in CI/CD, developers can catch vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle, and fix issues while they are still in the context of the code.</p>



<p>After an initial triage of any existing security bugs, application security tooling should at least be configured to break the build if any new high criticality vulnerabilities are identified. This doesn’t mean that every vulnerability should prevent a deploy to production, but that deploy should be done eyes wide open to the risk it presents.</p>



<h4 id="h-triage-and-initial-risk-decisions-live-with-developers">Triage and Initial Risk Decisions Live with Developers</h4>



<p>When a vulnerability is found, the developer(s) who were recently working on the application are best equipped to review the finding and make risk-based decisions. Should this block the deploy to production? Can this be added to a backlog and addressed later? Is this low enough risk that it isn’t worth fixing?</p>



<p>The individuals who are intimately involved in creating the application are best equipped as the first-line of defense for these decisions. Internal security teams are undoubtedly called upon for clarification and support (…and are often reviewing historical decisions as well), but modern teams are empowering developers to make these triage decisions themselves.</p>



<h4 id="h-fast-developer-fixes">Fast Developer Fixes</h4>



<p>When a security bug requires a fix, the responsibility for the fix squarely lives with the developer who introduced the vulnerability in modern teams. This individual is in the codebase, familiar with the context of the recent vulnerability addition. Not only are they best equipped to implement the fix, but by democratizing this responsibility across the team, no person or team bears the burden of interrupt driven work.</p>



<h3 id="h-taking-ownership-of-application-security">Taking Ownership of Application Security</h3>



<p>Ever since we embarked upon building StackHawk, we have been laser focused on building a tool for developers. The market is rife with security tools built for the CISO that no developer wants to use, and these tools typically start at six-figure contracts. StackHawk is different, and we are excited to equip engineers to own the security of their application. This shows up in our product, and with our new free Developer Plan, it also shows up in our pricing.</p>



<p>Now individuals or teams can start running application security tests against their first application for free. There is no longer an excuse not to be looking at the security of your application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started with StackHawk is easy, with most developers completing their first security test in under 20 minutes. You can get the full details in <a href="https://docs.stackhawk.com/">our docs</a>, but in short it is as simple as building a yaml config, pointing the scanner at your application, and taking a look at the results.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://auth.stackhawk.com/signup">Sign up</a> for a free account and give it a try today!</p>

                            <p>
                                Tuesday December 08, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/lars-knoll">Lars Knoll</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>I am really excited to announce today’s release of Qt 6.0. It is the first release of a new major version, and marks a major milestone for Qt. </span><strong><em>We started working on the initial ideas a few years ago, and since then, have put a massive effort into creating the next generation of Qt. </em></strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20email%20launch%20hero%201-png-1.png" alt="Qt 6"></span></a></p>

<p><span>Qt 5 has been a fantastic success over the years, and we have seen an enormous growth of our user base and Qt usage over eight years since we released Qt 5.0. But the world&nbsp; has undergone significant changes since 2012. Qt usage in embedded systems has skyrocketed, C++ has evolved, and new 3D graphics APIs have emerged. These are examples of factors that have directly affected Qt.</span></p>
<p><span>As a cross-platform framework, Qt needs to adjust to those changing requirements. We have managed to adapt very well to many of those requirements during the lifetime of Qt 5. However, maintaining full source and binary compatibility within the Qt 5 series made certain things impossible to fix within its lifetime. With Qt 6, we now have the opportunity to make changes and build Qt to be better suited for the years to come.</span><span></span></p>
<div>
<p>Thus, the mission of Qt 6 is to enable Qt to be the productivity platform for the future. Qt 6.0, as a major release of Qt, gave us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality, and better support today and tomorrow's requirements. Qt 6.0 is a continuation of the Qt 5 series, and we have focused on making migration non-disruptive for users. I published a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener">Qt 6 vision blog post</a> capturing those ideas around 18 months ago.</p>
<p>When creating Qt 6, we ensured that Qt’s core values have been adhered to and upheld, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its cross-platform nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single codebase</li>
<li>Its scalability from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li>Its world-class APIs and tools and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/" rel="noopener">documentation</a>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li>Its maintainability, stability, and compatibility, allowing users to maintain large codebases with minimal effort</li>
<li>Its large developer ecosystem with more than 1.5 million users</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt 6.0 is the first release of the Qt 6 series addressing new market demands while keeping the core values at the heart of what we do.</p>
<p>When developing Qt 6, we had an in-depth look at some of Qt's most central parts to identify how we could improve them. We discovered a couple of core focus areas that we invested considerable time in improving. Those areas include:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging C++17</li>
<li>Next generation QML</li>
<li>New graphics architecture</li>
<li>Unified 2D and 3D for Qt Quick</li>
<li>CMake build system (with qmake still supported for applications)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We have of course also spent time doing numerous improvements in other areas, too many to mention them all here, and I suggest you look at the more detailed <span><span><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_6.0" rel="noopener">wiki page</a>. We are also hosting Meet Qt 6.0 webinar sessions covering the <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607340244" rel="noopener">Americas/EMEIA</a> and <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607339968" rel="noopener">EMEIA/APAC</a> time zones. But let's take a look at some of the highlights.</span></span></p>
</div>
<h3><span>C++17</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png" width="168" alt="C++ 17 in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=84&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 84w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 168w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=252&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 252w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=336&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 336w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=420&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 420w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=504&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 504w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px"></span></p>
<p><span>With Qt 6 we now require a C++17 compatible compiler enabling the use more modern C++ language constructs when developing Qt and also allows for integration points on the API side.</span></p>
<h3><span>Core libraries and APIs</span></h3>
<p><span>Much work has gone into Qt Core, as it is the module that implements the most central parts of Qt. We've gone through many areas there and made improvements. To name some of the most central ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The new <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/property-bindings-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">property and binding system</a>: This system now brings the concept of bindings that made QML such a huge success in Qt 5 available from C++. </span></li>
<li><span>Strings and Unicode: With Qt 5, we started aligning Qt fully with Unicode, where we completed a lot of the work, but a few items remained that we now cleaned up for Qt 6. More details will come in a separate blog post later on.</span></li>
<li><span>QList has been a class that was often criticized in Qt 5, as it was heap allocating objects stored in there that were larger than a pointer, leading to pressure on heap allocation methods. In Qt 6, we changed this and unified QList and QVector into one class. See our <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qlist-changes-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post about QList</a> in Qt 6 for details.</span></li>
<li><span>QMetaType and QVariant are fundamental to how our Qt’s meta-object system works. Signals and slots would not be possible without QMetaType and QVariant is required for dynamic invocations. Those two classes got an almost complete rewrite with Qt 6, and you can read about the details <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/whats-new-in-qmetatype-qvariant" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other parts of Qt that are not related to graphics have also seen large changes. For example, Qt Concurrent has undergone an almost complete rewrite and now makes development of multi-threaded applications more effortless than ever. Qt Network has seen lots of clean-up and improvements. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-network-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post</a> for details.</span></p>
<h3><span>New graphics architecture</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></h3>
<p><span>The graphics architecture of Qt 5 was very much dependent on OpenGL as the underlying 3D graphics API. While this was the right approach in 2012 when we created Qt 5, the market around us has changed significantly over the last couple of years with the introduction of Metal and Vulkan. We now have a large set of different graphics APIs that are commonly being used on different platforms. For Qt as a cross-platform framework, this, of course, meant that we had to adjust to this and ensure our users can run Qt on all of them with </span>maximum performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png" width="367" alt="New graphics architecture in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=184&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 184w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 367w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=551&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 551w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=734&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 734w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=918&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 918w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=1101&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 1101w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px"></p>
<p><span>So while Qt 5 relied on OpenGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, the picture completely changes with Qt 6. All of our 3D graphics in Qt Quick is now built on top of a new abstraction layer for 3D graphics called RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface). RHI makes it possible for Qt to use the native 3D graphics API of the underlying OS/platform. So Qt Quick will now use Direct3D on Windows and Metal on macOS by default. For details, have a look at the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/graphics-in-qt-6.0-qrhi-qt-quick-qt-quick-3d" rel="noopener">blog post series about the RHI</a>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OpenGL specific classes in Qt still exist, but are now moved out of QtGui in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-index.html" rel="noopener">QtOpenGL</a> module. We also added a new module called <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtshadertools-index.html" rel="noopener">QtShaderTools</a> to deal with the different shading languages of those APIs in a cross-platform way.</span></p>
<h3><span>Qt Quick 3D and Qt 3D</span></h3>
<p><span>Qt Quick 3D is a relatively new module. It seamlessly extends Qt Quick with 3D capabilities. With Qt Quick 3D, our focus was to create an API that is as easy to use as the existing parts of Qt Quick (for 2D user interfaces) while providing full support for creating complex 3D scenes. The main goal behind this effort has been to enable seamless integration between 2D and 3D content.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This module has seen significant improvements with Qt 6 that we wouldn’t have been able to do in the Qt 5 series. Most importantly it is now always using the RHI abstraction layer to make optimal use of the underlying graphics API and Hardware. Additionally, it now features a much deeper and more performant integration between 2D and 3D content, allowing you to place 2D items into a 3D scene. It also has vastly improved support for glTF2 and physics-based rendering, making it trivial to import assets created in other design tools. There are many other major improvements in the module, a more in-depth description can be found in a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/what-is-new-in-qt-quick-3d-6.0" rel="noopener">separate blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 3D is now also based on top of the RHI abstraction layer, has seen some performance improvements and cleanups. You can find more details in two blog posts by our partner KDAB (<a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt-3d-changes-in-qt-6/" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt3d-renderer-qt6/" rel="noopener">here</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span>Desktop styling for Qt Quick</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20Desktop%20Styling-png.png" alt="Desktop Styling in Qt 6"></span></p>
<p><span>When we created the set of controls for Qt Quick, our focus was to make them lightweight and performant. For that reason, they did not support desktop styling in Qt 5. However, in Qt 6, we found a way to make them look &amp; feel native on desktop operating systems. With 6.0, Qt Quick now supports native styling on both macOS and Windows. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls" rel="noopener">blog post for details</a>.</span><span> Native look &amp; feel for Android and Linux already existed with the Material and Fusion styles in Qt 5. We are improving those for future Qt releases and are also planning to implement a native style for iOS.</span></p>
<h3><span>Interfacing with platform specific functionality</span></h3>
<p><span>Even with Qt offering most functionality required to develop your application platform-independently, there is sometimes a need to interface with platform-specific functionality. In Qt 5, we provided a set of add-on modules (QtX11Extras, QtWinExtras, QtMacExtras) to help with this purpose. But this full separation from the rest of Qt has led to a couple of architectural issues, inconsistencies and code duplication within Qt. In Qt 6, we made an effort to clean this up and fold the functionality offered by those add-on modules into platform specific APIs offered directly in Qt. This will make interfacing with OS/platform-specific APIs much easier in Qt 6. Have a look <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/platform-apis-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;for more details.</span></p>
<h3><span>Build system and&nbsp;</span><span>Packaging</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png" width="189" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=95&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 95w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 189w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=284&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 284w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=378&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 378w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=473&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 473w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=567&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 567w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></span></p>
<p><span>We also made some considerable changes in how we build and distribute Qt.&nbsp; Worth mentioning is that Qt 6 itself is now <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system" rel="noopener">built using CMake</a>. This has also led to significant improvements for all our users that use CMake to build their projects. We will continue to support qmake for the lifetime of Qt 6, so there is no need to make any changes to your build system if you're using it, but we recommend to use CMake for all new projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6 also comes with a much smaller default package, and many of the add-ons are now distributed as separate packages through a package manager. This gives us more flexibility in adapting release schedules of add-ons to market requirements, allowing, for example, for more frequent feature releases as the core Qt packages or making them available for multiple Qt versions at the same time. In addition, we can use the package manager as a delivery channel for 3rd party content. And finally, it gives our users more flexibility as they can choose to download only what they really need. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, we are using the existing Qt …</span></p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today we're excited to announce that we've joined Google Cloud. Over the course of the past several months, our partnership with Google Cloud has deepened and we believe that our new combined efforts can make our customers and partners even more successful.</p><div><div><p>To our customers, users, supporters and contributors - today, we are extremely excited to share that Dataform is joining Google Cloud!</p>
<p>Before we jump into the story, let us quickly answer what we think will be the most important questions for existing and new users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataform Web will continue to be run and maintained by us, as part of Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will be free for all new users as of today, December 8th 2020.</li>
<li>Existing customers will be transitioned onto the free plan immediately.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will focus on support for BigQuery going forward.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ll be working closely with the rest of the Google Cloud Data Analytics team over the next year to deliver our vision for Dataform within Google Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three years ago we started Dataform with a mission to <strong>empower analysts to manage the entire flow of data in the warehouse, using a single, unified workflow</strong>. Throughout our journey weâ€™ve been focused on giving data analysts and data engineers the tools they need to take raw, messy data, transform it, and put it into the hands of their organization. Weâ€™ve only just scratched the surface of this problem and solving it will continue to be our core mission and focus going forward.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve followed Googleâ€™s products and successes within analytics closely over the past few years, and always felt that they were a product leader when it came to cloud data warehousing, SQL, and now business intelligence; with products such as Looker that inspired us significantly in our own journey. After several conversations with the Google Cloud team it became clear that we are deeply aligned on the importance of serving analysts with the right tools and technology in order to fill what we all perceive as a missed opportunity in existing solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a team of just 7, in a complex, competitive and rapidly changing market, we had more ideas than we had people or resources to accomplish. There has always been so much more we wanted to do each quarter than we could achieve. With the support of the BigQuery and Cloud Analytics teams and our combined thought leadership and efforts, we felt that together we could achieve something bigger than we could separately.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some changes to the product and how we operate over the coming years, but one thing that will not change is our commitment to the principles that we feel have gotten us this far: working closely with our customers, making sure we continue to collect and act upon your feedback, and a laser focus on doing one thing and doing it well.</p>
<p>At Dataform we always felt we were delivering a unique and innovative product to our customers and the data community. With Googleâ€™s support, we have even more confidence in our ability to build and deliver a product that can truly change the way that all companies, large and small, work with data. </p>
<p>In the coming months weâ€™ll be able to share more details of our product roadmap. In the meantime please reach out to us if you have any questions. Thank you again for joining us on this journey. Weâ€™re uncomfortably excited about what we can accomplish together over the coming years!</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>â€˜Darkâ€™ personalities come in</strong> various shades, but at the core of all of them is a tendency to callously use others for personal gain. What is it that these types of people are really gaining, though? Might a benevolent approach to life and others be even more advantageous?</p>
<p>For <span>15 years,</span> research into dark personality traits (including narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) has been rapidly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">expanding</a>. We now know that these traits are far more <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32484407" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evident</a>, on average, in men than women. We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">approximately</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-13625-018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span>1-2 per cent</span></a> of individuals in the general population display extremely dark personality features â€“ enough to meet the clinical threshold for a personality disorder â€“ and about <span>10-20 per</span> cent of individuals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22996170/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">have</a> moderately elevated levels. We know that even people with moderate levels of dark traits can wreak havoc: they are more likely to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616666070" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">lie and cheat</a>, show <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305468" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">racist</a> attitudes, and be <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-04417-005" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent</a> towards others.</p>
<p>As researchers, we have studied these traits ourselves. But in a bid to balance out the extensive literature on dark traits, we have recently started to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">focus</a> on the light side of human personality instead â€“ the â€˜everyday saintsâ€™ among us. These people are genuinely interested in others and treat them well without question, not as a means to an end. They applaud the success of others, believe in the fundamental goodness of humans, and respect the dignity of everyone. Our recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692030310X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 36,000 adults suggests that these traits are common: around <span>30-50 per cent</span> of people show prominent light personality trait profiles, depending on world region, and these traits are particularly common in women.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand which personality profile â€“ dark or light â€“ leads to more success and happiness in the long run. There is an oft-touted saying that â€˜Nice guys finish lastâ€™ and, on the face of it, this might seem correct. If youâ€™re always expending your energy caring about others, perhaps youâ€™re bound to get left behind. If youâ€™re willing to deceive and exploit others without worrying about their feelings, you can look after â€˜number oneâ€™ and rise faster to the top. But does the research back this up?</p>
<p>Experimental studies support the idea of a â€˜successfulâ€™ dark personality, but only up to a point. One <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-11168-026" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that people with psychopathic personality traits win more points on a negotiation task where they are required to compete with a partner, but fewer points on a task that involves cooperation. Those with dark traits are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-018-9823-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">more</a> likely to â€˜defectâ€™ in the classic Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma task â€“ an approach that means maximising your own outcome while duping the other participant.</p>
<p>But their success in the real world is questionable. In corporate settings, those with dark personality traits are slightly more likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51219-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emerge</a> as leaders and are seen as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.925" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">charismatic</a> but, when it comes to getting the job done, they tend to achieve less and are considered poor team players. Our recent study also found that political figures with dark personality traits are more likely to get elected and hold their positions, but other studies <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615611922" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">show</a> that they are much poorer at getting legislation passed. Hedge fund managers with these traits generally <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217733080" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">obtain</a> significantly lower financial returns on the investment funds they manage. Overall, individuals with dark traits <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0025679" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">engage</a> in more counterproductive work behaviour, such as theft and abusive supervision. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they donâ€™t end up with higher average incomes than their peers with light personalities.</p>
<p>Through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on</p>
<p>On top of this, those with dark personality traits donâ€™t have much luck outside of work. Even if they manage to avoid prison (imprisonment being a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18837606/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">high</a> possibility for those with extreme traits), they are at increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suicide</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556964/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent death</a>. They are also not particularly happy: people with dark traits tend to report poor self-image, an inability to intimately connect with others, and little life satisfaction. In contrast, we found that those with light personality trait profiles have fulfilling, intrinsically rewarding lives: they generally have a more positive view of themselves, more positive connections with others and find life more satisfying.</p>
<p>The key factor here seems to be empathy: the capacity to resonate with â€“ and understand the perspective of â€“ the emotional experiences of others. Individuals with light personality traits show a great deal of empathy for others, while those with dark personality traits tend to show very little. In our new research, we found that this seems to be what leads to a more satisfying life. Similarly, being prosocial â€“ acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others â€“ is also significantly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-65092-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> with higher wellbeing.</p>
<p>As a species, weâ€™re fundamentally built for social connectedness, and we depend on cooperation and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.14.3.137" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">trust</a>. When those with dark personalities try to take advantage of this for their own personal gain, they do so at their own peril. In essence, through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on. While those with dark traits might initially capture the attention of others, their social behaviour ultimately leads to limited success in work or politics, and little satisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>So far, we have</strong> made it seem as though people fall into one of two binary groups: dark or light. But in reality, thereâ€™s a third group: we found that about <span>40 per cent</span> of individuals show a balance of dark and light traits. People in this mixed group are similar to the light group when it comes to critical variables involving empathy and social connectedness, but they still show some dark tendencies â€“ hampering their relationships to some degree with deceitful, self-absorbed or hurtful behaviour toward others.</p>
<p>Some might think that the mixed group is the optimal place to be: youâ€™re able to have some connection with others, but wonâ€™t be taken as a pushover. But compared with those with a light personality, mixed individuals have lower levels of life satisfaction and a less positive self-image. It seems that the mixed group are on the way to the light personality profile, so to speak, but fall short of the full expression â€“ and the added dark traits are whatâ€™s holding them back.</p>
<p>As people age â€“ particularly from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles</p>
<p>Regardless of where you fall on these dimensions of personality, we <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">believe</a> in the fundamental ability to grow and change. Large-scale studies have <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0024950" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">documented</a> that your general personality (eg, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness) continues to change throughout your lifetime, and weâ€™ve found the same to be true when it comes to light and dark traits.</p>
<p>Specifically, we found that the extent to which you exhibit light or dark personality traits tends to shift as you get older. As people age â€“ particularly as they progress from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles. Other <a href="https://content.apa.org/record/2014-34008-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that moral character traits, such as conscientiousness and self-control, are generally more common in older people. Age doesnâ€™t completely account for the results â€“ younger people can display light personality traits â€“ but the research suggests that what can fundamentally differentiate light and dark profiles is a process of psychological maturation.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417734875" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">born</a> with an innate sense of fairness, though this is a limited ability. Thus, like language, it is a skill that requires further development. Our research, and studies of our closest relatives, nonhuman primates, both show that moral behaviour can emerge and change across development â€“ in large part through cooperative social interactions. Thus, by embracing and trusting social connections, we can progress toward a light personality trait profile â€“ a pathway that appears to lead to healthy self-actualisation and even transcendence.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re curious about where you fall on the light vs dark personality spectrum, you can answer the <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">questions</a> we used in our study. We have now tested more than 250,000 individuals from across the globe, and you can see how your responses compare with the average. And remember, there is always scope for change: we believe in the fundamental ability to grow and transcend self-centredness through deliberate and sustained changes in our patterns of behaviour and thinking.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to <em>want</em> to change. Unfortunately, most people with extreme levels of dark personality traits donâ€™t want to change who they are. Despite not being particularly happy with their lives, they remain fixated on what they think they need: more and more power, wealth and domination over others.</p>
<p>Of course, some days weâ€™re all motivated to shut out other people, and simply look out for ourselves. This can be especially true when it seems that those who cheat, deceive and take advantage of others are somehow getting ahead. But rest assured that this doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. We have found that being empathic and connected to others â€“ capitalising on our fundamentally social nature â€“ is ultimately the pathway to a more rewarding life.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 7, 2020 | https://rome.tools/funding/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rome.tools/funding/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <section>  <section> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction" aria-label="introduction"></a></h2>  <p>I’m Sebastian McKenzie, the creator of <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>. These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD. Includes sales tax and international shipping. Refer to <a href="#questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers</a> for more information.</p> <p> Loading... </p> <div> <h4>Custom</h4> <p>Want to donate under $10? Something else? Select your own amount!</p>  </div> <section> <h4 id="business">Business <a href="#business" aria-label="business"></a></h4> <p>These tiers include dedicated support, migration assistance, and website advertisement. I’ll make sure Rome works well for you and your organization.</p> <p>Migration support is where I personally help your organization adopt and use Rome. This could include porting configuration, integrating with CI, or even adding new features and configuration to Rome.</p> <p>Interested in something else or have questions? Get in touch at <a href="https://rome.tools/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#473422252634332e26290735282a22693328282b34"><span data-cfemail="abd8cec9cad8dfc2cac5ebd9c4c6ce85dfc4c4c7d8">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>!</p> <p> Loading... </p> </section> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="goals">Goals <a href="#goals" aria-label="goals"></a></h2> <p>Funding will allow us to focus on usage and labor-intensive goals. We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

During this amyloid stage, which can last two decades or more, people show no signs of cognitive decline. However, soon after tangles of tau begin to spread in the neurons, people start exhibiting confusion and memory loss, and brain scans show increasing atrophy of brain tissue.</p><p>Tau tangles can be detected by positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans, but brain scans are time-consuming, expensive and not available everywhere.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=OGY3MzFiOWFhZjk2MzY1NmNmZGFmZjBiNDQxNTE0NjRmZDFiOGNmNCxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607675753">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=NmI5NzQxYjQ3Njg4NjJmOTJlZDI1ZDI4MWZlN2I1Y2IzZjI2NjAzYyxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607675753">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<ul><li><strong>Intranasally delivered.</strong> Very simple to self administer. No injection, no needles. </li><li><strong>Synthetic peptide epitopes / antigens</strong>. These peptides are small synthetically produced portions of viral sequences. A peptide-based vaccine is not infectious. We have selected these peptides as the basis for our vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The antigen portion of the vaccine can be substituted by other antigens; for example, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD. By appropriate selection of antigens, the intranasal vaccine design described here can also be adapted for use against other viruses, especially respiratory viruses, such as influenza or non-SARS coronaviruses.</li><li><strong>Chitosan nanoparticle delivery</strong>. Chitosan is a form of chitin, which is found in mushrooms and the shells of crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs (seafood allergies are not allergies to chitin). Chitosan acts as both delivery vehicle and immunostimulatory adjuvant.</li><li><strong>Extremely simple and inexpensive preparation</strong> with easily obtained materials.</li><li><strong>Short-term safety. </strong>This type of vaccine has shown excellent safety in animal studies and human clinical trials. The RaDVaC vaccine has been used repeatedly over several months,  by over 100 self-experimenters, with the most extreme complication in some recipients of stuffy noses. </li></ul>



<p>Protocols for the simple and robust production of chitosan nanoparticle vaccines for intranasal delivery have been published for over two decades. Intranasal delivery of chitosan-based vaccines have shown mild side effects and high levels of efficacy of both mucosal and systemic immunity, when delivered in a prime-boost regimen (in both animal models and human trials). </p>

<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, when we were studying, one teaching DVK could distribute programs for a couple of dozen Spectrums through the network.</p>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>
