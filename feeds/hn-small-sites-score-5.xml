<p>Hey everyone, <br>

Today is a big day for NeuralCam. We have three announcements to make: some news about NeuralCam as a company, a major update for our NightMode app and a brand new <strong>Smart Camera app.</strong>
</p><br>
<h3>
NeuralCam - building Smart Camera Apps
</h3>
<div><p>Let’s start by talking a bit about cameras and AI. </p><p>

At NeuralCam, we think that one of the biggest leaps in technology over the past years has been the advances Deep Learning brought in the area of Computer Vision. It gives computers the ability to see - to understand patterns, images and video similarly to how people do.
 </p></div>



<p>Ultimately, we think this technology will give birth to a new category of cameras - <b>Smart Cameras</b> - that will have a profound impact on every activity that involves capturing and processing images.
</p>

<p>We see this change similar to the transformation from classic cellular phones to the modern smartphone we witnessed 10 years ago. We believe that martphones themselves seem to be the ideal smart camera platform: they have high quality cameras and enough processing power to run modern AI algorithms on-device.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartcameras.png">
</p>

<p>So, we can all have our own personal smart cameras in our pockets, all that’s needed is the right ML software. This ML software is what we call Smart Camera Apps, and these are the type of apps we’re building at NeuralCam.
</p>

<p>Whenever we see a visual task we might say “there’s a Smart Cam App for that”. We’ve been doing a lot of research and prototyping and we’re more and more confident that smart camera apps will play a key role in every industry, from Education through Healthcare to Entertainment, and we can’t wait to contribute something in each of these areas.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartapps.png">
</p>

<p>However, the first category that is naturally most likely to change is almost analogous to the camera itself: photography and videography. Thus, this is what we’ve decided to start with, building AI powered Photo &amp; Video apps over the next few years. 
</p>

<p>Our first smart photo app we’ve launched is the NeuralCam NightMode app, which brought Night Mode to all iPhones and all iPhone camera lenses. But, NeuralCam is more than the Night Mode app. We think of NeuralCam as a range of smart camera apps in different categories for various use cases. 
</p>



<p>So, one of the things we did is update our brand to reflect this change. This is the first thing we’d like to show you today, a fresh NeuralCam: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nclogo.png"></p>

<p>And this is the new NeuralCam NightMode:</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NightModeLogo.png">
<br>
</p>
<p>Ok, so that’s the story of NeuralCam - the company. The second thing we want to show you is an update to our NightMode app. 

</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam NightMode</h3>

<p>We <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/neuralcam" target="_blank">launched</a> our first smart camera app, NeuralCam NightMode, about a year ago, last August. It brought NightMode to the iPhone and the response from the users and critics <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/30/iphone-camera-app-for-night-shots/" target="_blank">was amazing.</a>
</p>

<p>We’ve been <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/08/28/neuralcam-night-photo-app-brings-ai-powered-low-light-mode-to-iphones/" target="_blank">covered</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/25/iphone-11-pro-camera-review-features-with-night-mode-app/" target="_blank">in many</a> <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/08/30/iphone-11-release-date-soon-specs-camera-night-mode/" target="_blank">major</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2019/08/29/this-app-uses-ai-to-add-a-pixel-style-night-photography-mode-to-your-iphone/" target="_blank">press</a> <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/neuralcam-iphone-app-uses-ai-to-capture-bright-images-at-night-26588672/" target="_blank">publications</a>, got lots of love letters from users, and been recognized as the best NightMode app out there. 
</p>
<p>While Apple has launched a built-in night mode on the iPhone 11 in the meantime, NeuralCam continues to be the NightMode solution for devices or iPhone cameras without a native NightMode - like the newly launched iPhone SE or even the UltraWide &amp; Selfie cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro. </p>
<p>Since its launch, people have used NeuralCam NightMode to take more than 10M low light photos. 
</p>

<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/10M.png"></p></div>

<p>Now, with a major update, we have made our NightMode app even better: we've made some major improvements to our algorithm so that it supports higher resolutions on older devices too; we’ve updated the UI to be in-line with the new NeuralCam brand and we’ve officially added iPad support.</p><p>This is how the update NeuralCam NightMode app looks like on an iPad:</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/nmupdate.png">
<br>
</p>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">NeuralCam Live</h3>

<p>The popularity of video calls has exploded lately. In the current global context, most of us use video calls a lot for both getting our job done or to keep in touch with loved ones. For something used as often, we really need to have the best possible tools. 

</p>

<p>Looking at the things out there, we realized that there’s a weak link in all this video call experience, and it’s the webcams. </p><p>We’ve got laptop webcams (quite bad), dedicated webcams (a bit better) or apps that let you use your iPhone as a webcam (best quality). However, these products really only differ from one another in the resolution of the video they provide. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/webcams.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The problem with webcams is that they’re mostly the same as they were 10 years ago, they do the same thing only slightly better. In the meantime, this cool new technology called Deep Learning came along which could add a whole new dimension to webcams and possibly change the whole video call experience - but nobody uses it. 

</p>

<p>
It turns out that one of the main reasons for Deep Learning not being used with webcams is that no webcam has the processing power required to run the required ML algorithms. Except there is one device which, when converted to a webcam, could do all this: the iPhone in our pocket.
</p>

<p>It’s got one of the best cameras in the smartphone industry and with its fast processors and dedicated machine learning hardware, it is capable of running even video processing machine learning algorithms in real-time. It just needs the right SmartCam App software to do all this. 
  </p><p>We've built this software - we call it NeuralCam Live and it turns the iPhone into the <strong>world’s smartest webcam.</strong>
  </p>
<div><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/LiveLogo.png"></p></div>







<p>
	Ok, so how are we going to do that?
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Technology</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/tech.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>First, we need the software that connects the iPhone to the laptop and makes it appear just like a regular webcam when connected through a USB cable. 
</p>

<p>This software has two modules: the first one is an iOS app that provides the webcam functionality, while the second one is a plugin that’s installed on the laptop to make the iOS app appear as a webcam. Once you install both of these components, all you have to do is select the NeuralCam Live Camera in Zoom, Google Meet or your video call platform of choice.
</p>

<p>So, that was quite easy, now comes the fun part. </p><p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/engine.png">
<br>
</p>

<p> The second component we need is the machine learning software to make our smart webcam... well, smart. We call it the <b>LiveEngine</b> </p>

<p>Machine learning, as a generic technology, can help us in two ways when it comes to webcams: we can use it to recognize things in the video feed or generate new video content, improved in some way. </p><p>We’ve developed multiple machine learning modules, some proprietary, some built on top of existing CoreML models and we’ve grouped them in three different machine learning frameworks that cover both video generation and analysis: the Style Framework, the Enhance Framework and the Gesture Framework. Let’s take a quick look at each of these. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_style.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>The <b>Style Framework</b> is a deep learning-based machine learning framework that edits video similarly to a professional colorist. 
</p>
<p>Its Neural Nets were trained on images edited by hand by professionals in a range of different editing styles. The results are quite amazing, generating pro-looking videosf, very close in terms of style to the professionally edited frames it was trained on and it does all this in real-time at 30fps locally, on the user’s iPhone.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_enhance.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Enhance Framework</b> contains our set of machine learning models that can enhance a video in a bunch of different ways. </p>

<p>Our real-time video denoising and brightening models in this category achieve levels of quality and performance that are much better than traditional algorithms and make features such as video low light enhancement or face smoothing possible.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/f_recognition.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>The <b>Recognition Framework</b> is the part of our LiveEngine that is meant to make our smart camera apps understand what they “see”. </p>

<p>It uses a combination of machine learning models provided by the iPhone SDK and adds a number of proprietary elements to detect faces, user gestures or other different patterns in the live video feed. In the app, we can use this type of technology to blur unwanted gestures or guide you to set up an ideal environment for a call.
</p>

<p>Together, all these elements form what we call the LiveEngine - the ever-evolving software module that makes NeuralCam Live a smart webcam.
</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/NCFeats.png">
<br>
</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a look at the actual product. </p>
<p>The iPhone app exposes all of the functionality of the smart iPhone webcam in a simple layout, most of the features can be accessed by just tapping a button on the screen. It also shows a nice preview of the current video feed. 
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/smartwebcam.png">
<br>
</p>


<p>So, using all this technology, what more can a smart webcam do compared to a traditional webcam? 
</p>

<p>In terms of the outcome they provide to the user, we’ve realized that most of the AI features we’ve built fit nicely in two categories: making you look better and helping you avoid embarrassing mistakes.
</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at these features one-by-one: 
</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/fiq.png">
<br>
</p>

<h4>Face &amp; Image Quality Meter
</h4>



<p>The Face &amp; Image Quality Meter detects the amount of face lighting, type of face position and background and displays an overall Face Image Quality score. 
</p>

<p>It helps you set up an optimal video-call environment and helps you avoid making typical mistakes, such as sitting with your back towards a bright window or in an unfavorable low angle.
</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/styles.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>Pro Video Styling</h4>

<p>
  
  Using the Style Framework, NeuralCam Live edits the video feed like a professional colorist would, in a range of different styles. The end-result is a more impactful look, allowing you to choose the style that best fits your mood, the type of call or the environment you're in.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/content/lowlight.png">
  <br>
  </p>

<h4>
  
  Low-light Mode
</h4>

<p>It wouldn't be a NeuralCam product without a Night Mode, right? </p>
<p>NeuralCam Live’s Low Light Mode brightens up your video with a similar (though a lot more lightweight) technique used in our Night Mode photo app. It allows you to look good in video calls even in low light settings, a gentle light from your monitor is usually enough to provide a nice video feed. 
</p>

<p>
  
  And just in case you need to light up things even more, you can use the face-following Ring Light …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

		</div><p>It's Sweden's storied worker protections and climate-conscious citizens welcoming Amazon's ruthless drive for low prices. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Stockholm is preparing for a tug-of-war with one of the world’s most powerful companies — which just announced its entry into the Swedish market — and hopes that its arrival will mean the country of 10 million will be able to change Amazon, instead of being changed by it.</p>
<p>Amazon's plans — dubbed “<a href="https://www.ehandel.se/har-ar-amazon-se-det-blir-en-helsvensk-lansering" target="_blank">Project Dancing Queen</a>,” after the hit song by Swedish pop group Abba — don't have a lot of detail, but analysts believe its Swedish store will go live in the fall, in time for November’s Black Friday online shopping bonanza.</p>
<p>“Amazon has been supporting Swedish customers and selling partners across our different European stores for many years, but the next step is to bring a full retail offering to Sweden and we are making those plans now,” said Alex Ootes, Amazon’s vice president for EU expansion, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon’s turbo-capitalism corporate culture goes against the grain of Sweden and the rest of the Nordic countries, which pride themselves in their strong labor unions and sustainability.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls” <em>— Jonas Arnberg, CEO of market-research firm HUI</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But the country also has an affluent, internet-savvy market ripe for Alexa, Kindles, Prime and the thousands of items on Amazon's online store, the company believes. Around 68 percent of Swedes shopped online in 2018, and they spent an average of €200 per online transaction. In total, the Nordic countries spent over €22 billion online in 2018, according to a <a href="https://www.postnord.fi/siteassets/raportit/verkkokauppa-pohjoismaissa/ecommerce-in-the-nordics-2019.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by PostNord, the country’s postal service.</p>
<p>There's not a lot of competition in online marketplaces, and nobody can match Amazon’s massive cornucopia of goods.</p>
<p>“Swedish e-commerce is still like regular retail without shopping malls,” said Jonas Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, a market research company.</p>
<p>Amazon will change that, and force local players to adopt e-commerce faster than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>“It’s a perfect storm in e-commerce now. The COVID-19 impact took us two to three years forward in digitalization. With Amazon’s entry it is going to go even further,” said Kristoffer Väliharju, the CEO of CDON, a Nordic online marketplace. Väliharju is optimistic about CDON’s chances of taking on the tech giant, but said companies without a strong e-commerce game will likely take a big hit.</p>
<p>Initially, Swedish and Nordic clients will be mainly served from German warehouses — known as fulfillment centers in Amazon-speak — with trucks driving up to Sweden through Denmark, and a fulfillment center operated by local partner Kuehne + Nagel in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna, near Stockholm.</p>
<p>Analysts believe local warehouses are inevitable if Amazon is to offer one of its most unique selling points: quick delivery.</p>
<h3>When in Stockholm</h3>
<p>Establishing a local operation will be a major challenge for the company. American Amazon’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/how-amazon-is-fighting-back-against-workers-efforts-to-unionize.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-union stance</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working culture</a> is the antithesis of pro-union Sweden. (Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven's political career is rooted in union activism dating from his time as a welder.)</p>
<p>The Swedish labor market is regulated by collective agreements between companies and unions, giving workers plenty of power over corporate decisions. Approximately 70 percent of Swedish workers belong to a union.</p>
<p>“If Amazon wants to succeed in Sweden, they need to work very closely with unions,” said Arne Andersson, an e-commerce expert at PostNord.</p>
<p>Amazon has not yet contacted Handels, the union representing warehouse workers, its political coordinator Emelie Wärn told POLITICO.</p>

<p>“Amazon is welcome to Sweden, but they have to sign a collective agreement. We will work very hard to get them to do that,” Wärn said.</p>
<p>“The fact that international companies takes interest in the Swedish market place is a positive thing. As an employer in Sweden you are obliged to follow Swedish labor legislation, which includes regulations regarding collective bargaining,” said Eva Nordmark, Sweden’s minister of employment, adding that approximately 90 percent of the employees in Sweden are covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>The minimum wage for a card-carrying Swedish warehouse worker is 142.50 Swedish krona (€13.85) per hour before tax, according to Handels. In contrast, Amazon’s Polish warehouse workers who serve the German market <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-amazon-employees-rage/">earn</a> 20 zlotys (around €4.50). Amazon said its workers in Germany earn a base pay of €11.10 an hour.</p>
<p>But the union is confident it will be able to negotiate with the tech goliath. Handels has done similar deals with Japanese fashion chain Uniqlo, Wärn said as an example.</p>
<p>But Uniqlo is not Amazon, and Handels' confidence might be misplaced, according to Markus Varsikko, a retail consultant at Dash Retail, which helps businesses use Amazon's marketplace.</p>
<p>“Amazon is a realist. If they can operate in Germany, they can operate in Sweden. It is an American company with American culture and thinking, and it is far from what we are used to here,” Varsikko said, arguing that Sweden's companies and workers might have to adapt — not the tech giant.</p>
<h3>Handels and Greta</h3>
<p>Amazon might also have to polish its sustainability credentials to appease Swedish consumers.</p>
<p>“What makes the Swedish market unique is that there is a great focus on companies to do good, be transparent and sustainable. For many Swedes, this is even more important than a wide range and low price,” said Niclas Eriksson, the CEO of electronics retailer Elgiganten. And thanks to local activist Greta Thunberg, consumers are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/cancel-your-amazon-prime-subscription-save-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming increasingly aware</a> of the carbon footprint of services like next-day delivery.</p>
<blockquote><p>European consumer groups have slammed Amazon for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus Amazon's insistence on lower prices might not be its winning ticket.</p>
<p>The foray into the Swedish market by another e-commerce company, Wish, may serve as a cautionary tale. The American online marketplace, which mostly sells cheap items from China, tried and failed to take over the market a few years ago. The company first wooed consumers with dirt-cheap products such as electronics and clothes, only for Swedes to be disappointed by the quality of the products and frustrated by not being able to return products to sellers.</p>
<p>"[Wish] was cheap, it was a great marketplace, but it was also crap,” said PostNord’s Andersson. Wish did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon's had troubles with quality control too. European consumer groups have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/online-marketplaces-rife-with-unsafe-and-illegal-items-study-shows/">slammed</a> the company for selling dangerous and illegal products such as toxic toys and exploding power banks on its platform. The European Commission also put pressure on online platforms to control scammers and price gouging during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>CDON’s Väliharju said Swedish customers are very quality-conscious, and aware of their rights as consumers. Consumer groups and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-big-brands-chanel-canon-louis-vuitton-nike-are-taking-on-big-tech-silicon-valley-at-last/">brands</a> have criticized Amazon and others for not holding sufficient information about their sellers, especially for products that come from outside the European Union that could be dangerous or counterfeit.</p>
<p>“Amazon absolutely could be well met by Swedish consumers in the beginning,” said Arnberg, the CEO of HUI, citing Amazon’s promise of low prices, a big range of products and fast delivery.</p>
<p>“But in the long run they will have to adjust to Sweden."</p>

		Regardless of the outcome, the election will not stop the rise of hypernationalism, crisis cults and other signs of an empire's terminal decline. 	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>By Chris Hedges </strong>/ Original to Scheerpost</p>



<p>The terminal decline of the United States will not be solved by elections. The political rot and depravity will continue to eat away at the soul of the nation, spawning what anthropologists call crisis cults — movements led by demagogues that prey on an unbearable psychological and financial distress. These crisis cults, already well established among followers of the Christian Right and Donald Trump, peddle magical thinking and an infantilism that promises — in exchange for all autonomy — prosperity, a return to a mythical past, order and security. The dark yearnings among the white working class for vengeance and moral renewal through violence, the unchecked greed and corruption of the corporate oligarchs and billionaires who manage our failed democracy, which has already instituted wholesale government surveillance and revoked most civil liberties, are part of the twisted pathologies that infect all civilizations sputtering towards oblivion. I witnessed the deaths of other nations during the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and later in the former Yugoslavia. I have smelled this stench before.</p>



<p>The removal of Trump from office will only exacerbate the lust for racist violence he incites and the intoxicating elixir of white nationalism. The ruling elites, who first built a mafia economy and then built a mafia state, will continue under Biden, as they did under Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, to wantonly pillage and loot. The militarized police will not stop their lethal rampages in poor neighborhoods. The endless wars will not end. The bloated military budget will not be reduced. The world’s largest prison population will remain a stain upon the country. The manufacturing jobs shipped overseas will not return and the social inequality will grow. The for-profit health care system will gouge the public and price millions more out of the health care system. The language of hate and bigotry will be normalized as the primary form of communication. Internal enemies, including Muslims, immigrants and dissidents, will be defamed and attacked. The hypermasculinity that compensates for feelings of impotence will intensify. It will direct its venom towards women and all who fail to conform to rigid male stereotypes, especially artists, LGBTQ people and intellectuals. Lies, conspiracy theories, trivia and fake news — what Hannah Arendt called “nihilistic relativism” — will still dominate the airwaves and social media, mocking verifiable fact and truth. The ecocide, which presages the extinction of the human species and most other life forms, will barrel unabated towards its apocalyptic conclusion.</p>



<p>“We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of us to stop us seeing it,” Pascal wrote.</p>

<hr>



<p>The worse it gets — and it will get worse as the pandemic hits us in wave after deadly wave with an estimated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/06/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">300,000 Americans dead by December</a> and possibly 400,000 by January — the more desperate the nation will become. Tens of millions of people will be thrown into destitution, evicted from their homes and abandoned. Social collapse, as Peter Drucker observed in Weimar Germany in the 1930s, brings with it a loss of faith in ruling institutions and ruling ideologies. With no apparent answers or solutions to mounting chaos and catastrophe — and Biden and the Democratic Party have already precluded the kind of New Deal programs and assault on oligarchic power that saved us during the Great Depression — demagogues and charlatans need only denounce all institutions, all politicians, and all political and social conventions while conjuring up hosts of phantom enemies. Drucker saw that Nazism succeeded not because people believed in its fantastic promises, but in spite of them. Nazi absurdities, he pointed out, had been “witnessed by a hostile press, a hostile radio, a hostile cinema, a hostile church, and a hostile government which untiringly pointed out the Nazi lies, the Nazi inconsistency, the unattainability of their promises, and the dangers and folly of their course.” Nobody, he noted, “would have been a Nazi if rational belief in the Nazi promises had been a prerequisite.” The poet, playwright and socialist revolutionary Ernst Toller, who was forced into exile and stripped of his citizenship when the Nazis took power in 1933, wrote much the same in his autobiography: “The people are tired of reason, tired of thought and reflection. They ask, what has reason done in the last few years, what good have insights and knowledge done us.” After Toller committed suicide in 1939, W.H. Auden in his poem “In Memory of Ernst Toller” wrote:</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are lived by powers we pretend to understand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They arrange our loves; it is they who direct at the end<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy bullet, the sickness, or even our hand.</p>



<p>The poor, the vulnerable, those who are not white or not Christian, those who are undocumented or who do not mindlessly repeat the cant of a perverted Christian nationalism, will be offered up in a crisis to the god of death, a familiar form of human sacrifice that plagues sick societies. Once these enemies are purged from the nation, we are promised, America will recover its lost glory, except that once one enemy is obliterated another takes its place. Crisis cults require a steady escalation of conflict. This is what made the war in the former Yugoslavia inevitable. Once one stage of conflict reaches a crescendo it loses its efficacy. It must be replaced by ever more brutal and deadly confrontations. The intoxication and addiction to greater and greater levels of violence to purge the society of evil led to genocide in Germany and the former Yugoslavia. We are not immune. It is what Ernst Jünger called a “feast of death.”</p>



<p>These crisis cults are, as Drucker understood, irrational and schizophrenic. They have no coherent ideology. They turn morality upside down. They appeal exclusively to emotions. Burlesque and celebrity culture become politics. Depravity becomes morality. Atrocities and murder become heroism. Crime and fraud become justice. Greed and nepotism become civic virtues. What these cults stand for today, they condemn tomorrow. At the height of the reign of terror on May 6, 1794 during the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre announced that the Committee for Public Safety now recognized the existence of God. The French revolutionaries, fanatical atheists who had desecrated churches and confiscated church property, murdered hundreds of priests and forced another 30,000 into exile, instantly reversed themselves to send to the guillotine those who disparaged religion. In the end, exhausted by the moral confusion and internal contradictions, these crisis cults yearn for self-annihilation.</p>



<p>The French sociologist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emile-Durkheim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">Emile Durkheim</a> in his classic book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suicide-Penguin-Classics-Emile-Durkheim-ebook/dp/B002RI9XE2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">On Suicide</a>” found that when social bonds are shattered, when a population no longer feels it has a place or meaning in a society, personal and collective acts of self-destruction proliferate. Societies are held together by a web of social bonds that give individuals a sense of being part of a collective and engaged in a project larger than the self. This collective expresses itself through rituals, such as elections and democratic participation or an appeal to patriotism, and shared national beliefs. The bonds provide meaning, a sense of purpose, status and dignity. They offer psychological protection from impending mortality and the meaninglessness that comes with being isolated and alone. The breaking of these bonds plunges individuals into deep psychological distress. Durkheim called this state of hopelessness and despair anomie, which he defined as “ruleless-ness.”</p>



<p>Ruleless-ness means the norms that govern a society and create a sense of organic solidarity no longer function. The belief, for example, that if we work hard, obey the law and get a good education we can achieve stable employment, social status and mobility along with financial security becomes a lie. The old rules, imperfect and often untrue for poor people of color, nevertheless were not a complete fiction in the United States. They offered some Americans — especially those from the white working and middle class — modest social and economic advancement. The disintegration of these bonds has unleashed a widespread malaise Durkheim would have recognized. The self-destructive pathologies that plague the United States — opioid addiction, gambling, suicide, sexual sadism, hate groups and mass shootings — are products of this anomie. So is our political dysfunction. My book, “<a href="http://freshstore.truthdig.com/america-the-farewell-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">America: The Farewell Tour</a>,” is an examination of these pathologies and the widespread anomie that defines American society.</p>



<p>The economic structures, even before the pandemic, were reconfigured to mock faith in a meritocracy and the belief that hard work leads to a productive and valued role in society. American <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+economic+productivity&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">productivity</a>, as The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">pointed out</a>, has increased 77 percent since 1973 but hourly pay has grown only 12 percent. If the federal minimum wage was attached to productivity, the newspaper wrote, it would be more than $20 an hour now, not $7.25. Some 41.7 million workers, a third of the workforce, earn less than $12 an hour, and most of them do not have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. A decade after the 2008 financial meltdown, the Times wrote, the average middle class family’s net worth is more than $40,000 below what it was in 2007. The net worth of black families is down 40 percent, and for Latino families the figure has dropped 46 percent. Some four million evictions are filed each year. One in four tenant households spends <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="external">about half its pretax income</a> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div>  <div> <p>In this post, we’re going to talk about zkSNARKs, which are a particular brand of Zero Knowledge Proof that’s becoming increasingly important in the blockchain space.</p> <p>We’ll cover how they’re used and what they’re useful for, and we’ll take a look at a basic zkSNARK in a SNARK-building language called Circom.</p>  <p>We assume that you’re encountered prime fields before, and remember their basic properties. If you can calculate \(4 \cdot 5 \equiv 6\) in \(\mathbb{F}_7\), you’re good to go.</p>  <p>A <em>zero knowledge protocol</em> is a protocol that allows you to prove that you know some specific mathematical fact, without revealing any information about the fact itself. The proof generated in a zero knowledge protocol is called a <em>zero knowledge proof</em>.</p> <p>Some examples of “mathematical facts” that we can create zero knowledge proofs for include things like:</p> <ul> <li>Knowledge of a three-coloring of a graph (i.e. I know a three-coloring of this publicly-known graph, and I’ll prove that I know it without showing you the coloring)</li> <li>Knowledge of the discrete logarithm of some residue modulo \(p\) (i.e. given public generator \(g\), public modulus \(p\), and some residue \(y\), I know \(x\) such that \(g^x \equiv y\) modulo \(p\))</li> <li>Knowledge of a private key corresponding to a publicly-known public key</li> </ul> <p>The idea of a zero knowledge protocol might seem paradoxical at first glance: how can I prove I know something without showing you the thing that I know? However, it turns out that we actually use zero knowledge protocols all the time! For example, familiar tools like digital signatures are actually zero knowledge proofs. By signing a message, I prove that I know the private key that corresponds to a widely-known public key, but I don’t give away any information about the private key itself. In fact, public-key encryption only works because it is a zero knowledge protocol; if signatures revealed information about your private key, then malicious actors would be able to impersonate you by analyzing your signatures and recovering your private key.</p> <p>Slightly more formally, suppose that you’ve computed \(f(\cdot) = y\) for some publicly known function \(f\) and some secret input \(\cdot\). A zero-knowledge protocol for the function \(f\) would allow you to prove to others that you know a secret input to \(f\) that results in \(y\), without revealing this secret input \(\cdot\).</p> <p>For more on ZKPs, check out <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/11/27/zero-knowledge-proofs-illustrated-primer/">this post</a>.</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, ZKPs are protocols that allow you to prove knowledge of a specific mathematical fact: discrete log, knowledge of private key, knowledge of three-coloring, etc. However, it’s important to note that early ZKPs only allowed you to prove one kind of mathematical fact at the time. That is, cryptographers developed one protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of discrete log, another protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of three-coloring, and another protocol for digital signatures. But what if we want to generate zero knowledge proofs for arbitrary mathematical functions? For example - what if I want a zero knowledge protocol that would allow me to prove that I know the pre-image of a SHA256 hash output? It would be intractable if, for every use case, I had to go to a cryptographer and ask them to custom-write me a new protocol.</p> <p>zkSNARKs solve this problem. A zkSNARK is a gadget that can be used to generate a ZKP for any mathematical function. Basically, you feed the “code” of a function \(f\) into a zkSNARK, and the SNARK creates a protocol that allows you to generate zero-knowledge proofs for \(f\).</p> <p>As an example, say we have a fake “hash” function \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\) that we’d like to generate zero knowledge proofs for. First, we can use a zkSNARK to generate a ZKP for \(h\). Then, we can use this generated ZKP to prove claims like “I know a value \(\cdot\) such that \(h(\cdot) = 67\)” - <em>without revealing \(\cdot\)</em>. zkSNARKs also guarantee that this process is “succinct” and “non-interactive”: we can create this proof in linear time, and others can verify it in constant time, without needing to ask additional questions of us (the prover). Together, these properties form a zkSNARK: a <em>Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge</em>.</p> <p>These properties makes SNARKs useful for blockchain applications, where users can create proofs locally, and then upload short proofs for constant-time verification inside a smart contract, where computation is expensive.</p>  <p>A central mechanic in Dark Forest is that the cryptographic “fog of war.” The fog of war ensures that you don’t automatically know where all players, planets, and other points of interests are in the universe; you have to spend computational resources to discover them. This mechanic is secured by zkSNARKs.</p> <p>In a universe with a fog of war, the locations of all players are private and hidden from each other. This means that players don’t upload the coordinates of their planets to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be publicly inspected. Instead, each player uploads the hash of their location to the blockchain. This ensures that players stay “committed” to a specific location, but also that the location can’t be determined from inspection of the Ethereum data layer.</p> <p>Without zkSNARKs, there’s an obvious attack vector - if a player uploads a random string of bytes that doesn’t correspond to a real and valid location, and the integrity of the game is broken. To prevent this, Dark Forest requires players to submit zkSNARKs with every move to ensure that players are indeed submitting hashes corresponding to valid coordinates that they have knowledge of.</p> <p>When players make moves, they’re also required to submit ZK proofs that their moves are “valid” - you can’t move too far or too fast. Without zkSNARKs, a malicious player could make illegal “teleport” moves by claiming that the hash they are moving from is next to the hash they’re moving to, even if the two locations are actually on opposite sides of the universe. Once again, requiring ZK proofs keeps players honest. To use a chess analogy, the required ZK proofs basically tell the contract, “I’m moving my knight; I’m not going to tell you where I moved my knight from, or where I moved it to, but this proof proves that it did in fact move in a legal L-shape.”</p> <p>We’ll dive deeper into the Dark Forest construction and SNARKs in a future blog post!</p>  <p>Like we mentioned above, SNARKs are gadgets which take in a function and output a ZKP for said function. So how do we “feed” a function to a SNARK?</p> <p>SNARKs functions are written as circuits in the Circom language. Here’s an example circuit for our “fake” hash function, \(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\).</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// file: circuit.circom</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Our zkSNARK takes in this circuit, chews it up, and spits out a <em>proving key</em> and a <em>verifying key</em>. The proving key allows a prover who is computing <code>BadHash(x) = out</code> to generate a proof that they do indeed know the pre-image of <code>out</code>. The verifying key allows anyone to inspect that proof, along with <code>out</code>, and conclude that the prover did honestly carry out the computation with a known secret input.</p> <p>Concretely, suppose that the prover computes <code>BadHash(4) = 67</code>. The prover publishes their proof, along with <code>out = 67</code>, to the verifier; however, they do not publish the secret input <code>x = 4</code>. The verifier of this proof knows the source code of the <code>BadHash</code> circuit, and also receives <code>out = 67</code> and a proof from the prover. The verifier can then inspect the proof to verify that the prover did indeed compute some valid x, x_squared, and x_cubed to arrive at <code>out</code>. However, the verifier won’t know the specific values that the prover used (<code>x = 4</code>, <code>x_squared = 16</code>, <code>x_cubed = 64</code>) - just that these values were computed correctly.</p> <p>There are two things which make SNARK circuits different from normal “functions” that we’re used to.</p> <p>First, you’ll notice that BadHash only uses three operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. At the base level, SNARK constraints are limited to only these operations. There are ways to do operations like division and modulo, but they all ultimately involve breaking operations down into sums and products. The fact that we’re limited to these operations is part of what makes SNARK programming thorny.</p> <p>The second challenge is that each signal in a SNARK is an element of a prime field, and all operations happen inside that prime field. The most obvious implication of this is that there is no native notion of decimals, fractions, negative numbers, or numbers bigger than 77 digits. If you want one of these, you have to make them out of positive integers smaller than <code>p</code>. Another implication is that our operators “wrap around”: the result of <code>3 - 5</code> is <code>p - 2</code>, which is a 77 digit number. The prime is large enough (254) that most of the time this doesn’t matter, but occasionally it can cause subtle correctness bugs.</p> <p>To actually make proofs, we use a library called <a href="https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs">SnarkJS</a>, built by Jordi Baylina and Iden3. <code>SnarkJS</code> uses your circuit to generate proving and verification code in JavaScript and Solidity, as well as protocol paramters and proving and verification keys. This is out of the scope of this post, but you can find a tutorial on it <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circom/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md">here</a>.</p> <p>In the next posts, we’ll talk about the execution model of SNARKs, including the difference between calculation and constraint, and how to do operations like division and modulo.</p> </div> </div>  </div></div>]]>
