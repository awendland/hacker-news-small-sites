                    <p>Early in my career, after a short initial interview at a consulting firm in Toronto, I was invited to a technical interview on the same day. Two of the senior developers from the team I would join would conduct the interview.</p><p>The interview started pleasantly with them describing the project they have been working on: a portal for university professors to communicate with their students. It was being built with ASP.NET MVC, a framework I had been working with for several years. I expressed that I was comfortable with the framework and I would be excited to work on the project. Then the technical examination began and on its conclusion I left the interview feeling humiliated.</p><p>Many years later, when I was preparing to take an interview, I looked back on this experience to realize that the line of questioning and approach had been an ego trip for those developers. I promised myself to <em>never</em> make any of my candidates feel the way I did.</p><p>What did those developers do wrong? Leaving aside their attitude towards me, their questions had no relevance to the role or the project. I did not know what a red-black tree was at the time but I definitely knew how to use ASP.NET MVC which they did not inquire about.</p><p>My golden rule for technical interviews is that, "Every step, conversation and question <em>must</em> be pertinent to the day-to-day of the role." While this may be obvious, I am sure that many hiring managers are still expecting candidates to arrive at technical interviews with Computer Science books memorized. This form of technical interviews should be made obsolete.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bigger button = more clicks on the CTA <a href="https://t.co/Ter7xJdNKM">pic.twitter.com/Ter7xJdNKM</a></p>— Vincent Déniel (@vincentdnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentdnl/status/1291041278264713220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>With my golden rule as guide, I conduct a much simpler interview process. Prior to an interview, my team and I review samples of code that the candidate shared with us (or had written on Github) to understand the quality of their code. And during the interview, I dive into three areas of discussions with the candidates: product building, process adherence and team work.</p><h3 id="product-building">Product Building</h3><p>I try to understand the candidate's interest and experience of building products by,</p><ol><li>Going through their past experience and asking about what technologies and products they built and how. I ask about previous products they have shipped from concept to market.</li><li>To understand their thought process for deriving solutions, I draw an UI and ask them to outline and explain what approaches, structures and technologies they would use to build it out.</li><li>I ask about how they keep up with technologies and how they improve their skills to gauge their passion for the work.</li></ol><h3 id="process-adherence">Process Adherence</h3><p>To better understand how the candidate does their work,</p><ol><li>I go over their experiences and ask about how they managed their product-building and what tools and processes they used.</li><li>I explain the process of working on our team and ask how they would change it and where they see inefficiencies to discuss their thinking.</li><li>Often, I will give them a scenario where the processes are failing the team to find what they would do to tackle inefficiencies and if they would be willing to speak up.</li></ol><h3 id="team-work">Team Work</h3><p>I also try to understand how a candidate works in a team,</p><ol><li>While going through their past experiences, I ask about how they collaborated and communicated with their teams.</li><li>I present a scenario where their knowledge in an area may be lacking and evaluate if and how they would leverage and collaborate with their team.</li><li>Another scenario I ask about is where they disagree with their team-members to evaluate how they manage conflict and focus on delivering results for the team.</li></ol><p>I do this within one interview to be mindful of the candidate's time and mine. I want to hire candidates for their will to learn, grow and challenge the status quo.</p><p>The technology landscape is such that anyone can acquire a set of baseline programming skills. What is needed then, is a willingness to challenge ourselves and stay open-minded because every developer will have to learn on the job almost all of the time. Given this, the technical interview is arcane, academic and as good as dead.</p><hr><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><ol><li><a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/helpful-com/https-medium-com-fnthawar-helpful-technical-interviews-are-garbage-dc5d9aee5acd">Technical interviews are garbage.

<hr>
<h2 id="when-a-relationship-starts-with-an-act-of-dishonesty-or-manipulation-it-will-be-a-toxic-relationship"><em>When a relationship starts with an act of dishonesty or manipulation, it will be a toxic relationship</em>.</h2>
<p>This is common knowledge.</p>
<p>Most major web hosting companies groom potential customers in manipulative ways, but, sadly, many do not recognize the trouble signs due to naivety or need.</p>
<p>Here is one important, but common cue that your webhost-to-be will not respect you, and you are in for a compromising, dysfunctional relationship.</p>
<h2 id="but-you-said-395-a-month-">But you said 3.95 a month… :(</h2>
<h3 id="the-solicitation">The Solicitation</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/do-you-really-mean-it.jpg" alt="Do you really mean it?"></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200911190002/https://www.bluehost.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20200911190002/https://www.bluehost.com/</a></p>
<p>In the ad above, this average young woman has just been approached by what could be the prince-charming of webhosts, bluehost himself. She is excited and flattered that she could have him for the price of $3.50 a month.</p>
<p>Enticed, she takes the bait.</p>
<h3 id="getting-into-the-car">Getting into the Car</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/do-you-really-mean-it-2.jpg" alt="Is it too good to be true?"></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200910194510if_/https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared#pricing-cards">https://web.archive.org/web/20200910194510if_/https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/shared#pricing-cards</a></p>
<p>Now the young lady is excited, because although it seemed too good to be true, it looks like this might just be true love. $3.95 a month! Things are finally looking up.</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-ride">Taking the Ride</h3>
<p>After some flirty initial conversation of what her domain name will be, our prince charming bluehost finally gets down to his intentions.</p>
<p>He says, <strong>“So let’s talk about that $178.08…"</strong></p>
<p>And her heart sinks…</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/sign-your-webhost-does-not-respect-you/get-your-hands-off-me.jpg" alt="Get your hands off me!"></p>
<p>And now we’ve quickly arrived at that part of the relationship known as <em><strong>“Get your hands off me!"</strong></em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="17808-for-3-years-is-not-395-a-month">$178.08 for 3 Years is Not $3.95 a Month</h2>
<p>One might argue that if you divide the numbers over 3 years, it evens out to the price stated: $3.95.</p>
<p>But that’s <em>not</em> $3.95 a month.</p>
<p>That <em>is</em> $178.08 for three years.</p>
<p>If it was $3.95 a month, I could pay $3.95 for the first month, $3.95 for the second… $3.95 for the third … etc.</p>
<p>It was lie, a manipulation, a sign.</p>
<h3 id="my-wedding-ring-costs-less-per-month-every-year">My wedding ring costs less per month every year…</h3>
<p>So by this logic, a $1000 wedding ring costs $1.66 dollars a month after 50 years of marriage. Assuming there is no divorce.</p>
<h3 id="but-if-you-say-yes">But if you say yes…</h3>
<p>Sadly, some people will ignore the first alarm signs of the toxic relationship, and convince themselves that they did not just get manipulated.</p>
<p>Sadly, that “deal” is lost in a short time due to common upsells inherent to hosts such as this.  Because if you don’t say “get your hands off me” you enable future exploits, and the web host knows this. He’s good at what he does.</p>
<h3 id="prince-charming-is-a-dime-a-dozen">Prince Charming is a Dime a Dozen</h3>
<p>Despite how unique and valuable this prince charming purports to be, there is a street full of them coming from every alley way.</p>
<p>Most major cheap hosting companies operate this way.</p>
<p>Don’t give up your standards and settle. The good hosts are hard to find, because they don’t hang out in the main traffic areas of society/internet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>Thanks to Clint Gibler, Grayson Hardaway, and Pablo Estrada at r2c for their contributions to this piece. And thanks to r2c for contracting me to write it! This article is cross-posted on <a href="https://jacobian.org/2020/sep/11/analyzing-dos-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jacobian.org</a>.</em></p>
<p>When I ran the security team at Heroku, I had this recurring nightmare: my PagerDuty alarm goesoff, alerting me to some sort of security incident. In my dream, I’d look at my phone and realize “oh no, this is the big one” — and then I’d wake up.</p>
<p>I’m still not sure exactly what the attack in my dream was, but it may very well have been a <em>Denial-of-Service (DoS)</em> attack. DoS attacks are simple but can be devastating: an attacker crafts and sends traffic to your app in a way that overwhelms your servers. While this is arguably not as bad as a remote code execution or a data breach, it’s still pretty terrible. If your customers can’t use your app, you’ll lose their money and their trust.</p>
<p>Typically, we talk about two kinds of Denial-of-Service attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Normal” Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, where a single machine is sufficient to cause downtime. The classic, old-school version of this attack is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zip bomb</a>: an attacker tricks your server into expanding a specially-crafted ZIP file that is tiny compressed but expands to entirely fill your disk space.</li>
<li>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks rely on an attacker sending a huge flood of traffic to your site from multiple machines (that’s the “Distributed” part). Often, these attacks come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botnets</a> — fleets of compromised machines controlled by an attacker. These botnets are available to purchase in certain corners of the Internet, making a DDoS attack well within the reach of anyone with a credit card.</li>
</ol>
<p>Engineers who work on web applications frequently run into vulnerabilities that could be used in a DoS/DDoS attack. Unfortunately, there’s broad disagreement in the industry about how to treat these vulnerabilities. The risk can be difficult to analyze: I’ve seen development teams argue for <em>weeks</em> over how to handle a DoS vector.</p>
<p>This article tries to cut through those arguments. It provides a framework for engineering and application security teams to think about denial-of-service risk, breaks down DoS vulnerabilities into high-, medium-, and low-risk classes, and has recommendations for mitigations at each layer.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this post is on the big picture, and should apply to any kind of web app. But to make things concrete, I’ve added a few specific Django-related examples. (I helped create it, so it’s what I’m most familiar with.)</p>
<h2>Evaluating Denial-of-Service Risk</h2>
<p>Evaluating the risk of a DoS vulnerability at the application layer can be difficult. There’s widespread disagreement among security professionals: you’ll often see two different appsec teams treat similar issues very differently.</p>
<p>Some argue: it’s nearly impossible to entirely mitigate against a focused DDoS — a dedicated enough attacker can throw more bandwidth at you than your app can handle. You can never fully mitigate a DDoS attack without serious support from an upstream network provider with specific tools to protect bot attacks (e.g., Cloudflare). Thus, chasing and fixing hypothetical DoS vulnerabilities can seem like a waste of developer time. These teams treat most potential DoS vectors as acceptable risk, and focus their energy at preparing mitigations at the network level.</p>
<p>Other teams point out that the traditional risk model has three potential problem areas: Confidentiality, Integrity, and <em>Availability</em>. We’ve long understood that uptime is a security issue. It’s becoming increasingly common for attackers to take a service down and then demand a ransom to stop the attack. The recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attack against Garmin</a> is a highly notable example; attackers took down nearly all of Garmin’s services, and reportedly demanded US $1 million to stop the attack. (In this case the attack was ransomware, but it’s easy to see how a DoS attack could have a similar effect). Thus, DoS vulnerabilities are risks like any other, and it’s easy to understand the argument that they should all be mitigated.</p>
<p>It’s important to recognize that both of these positions are valid! It’s reasonable to see DoS as out-of-scope for application security; it’s similarly reasonable to scope it in. I’ve often seen security teams get completely stuck arguing between these two positions. Since neither is “right” or “wrong”, it can be impossible to figure out how to move forward.</p>
<h3><strong>How I decide: <em>attacker leverage</em></strong></h3>
<p>The model I use to cut through this argument is the concept of <em>attacker leverage</em>. Levers amplify force: a small amount of force applied to the long end of the lever is multiplied at the short end. In the context of a DoS attack, if a vulnerability has <em>high leverage</em> it means attackers can consume a ton of your server resources with minimal resources.</p>
<p>For example, if a bug in your web app allows a single <code>GET</code> request to consume 100% CPU, that’s a terrific amount of leverage. Just a small handful of attacks, and your web servers will grind to a halt. A <em>low leverage</em> vulnerability, on the other hand, requires a high amount of attacker resources to cause minor availability degradation. If an attacker has to spend thousands of dollars to bring a single server to its knees, you can probably scale up faster than they can.</p>
<p>The higher the leverage, the higher the risk, and the more likely I am to address the issue directly. The lower the leverage, the more likely I’ll accept the risk and/or lean on network-level mitigations.</p>
<p>Let’s get specific. I’ve broken down DoS risk into high, medium, and low risk classes, based on leverage. For each class, I’ll look at how to recognize that a vulnerability falls into this class, discuss a few examples, and give some suggestions for mitigation.</p>
<h2>High leverage DoS vulnerabilities: easily-amplified resource starvation</h2>
<p>The classic high-risk DoS vulnerability is one where an attacker can cause resource starvation using very little resources themselves. This could mean exhaustion of any number of types of resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> — e.g., a vulnerability that magnifies uploaded data and fills the disk, as in the case of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zip bomb</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Network bandwidth</strong> — e.g., a vulnerability that amplifies input traffic, where a single incoming request consumes tons of bandwidth, causing network starvation. I’ve seen this happen with a bug in a microservices system, where a single incoming request triggered millions of internal API requests (including moving some fairly large files around the network), and choked off the internal network bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>CPU utilization</strong> — e.g., an exploit that triggers an <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accidentally quadratic</a> algorithm, causing web servers to grind to a halt.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency limits</strong> — most servers have a maximum concurrency limit (e.g., max threads or processes, or max connections for a database); an exploit that causes a process to run very slowly (or never exit) can cause the server to hit those limits and start rejecting requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, the unifying factor is that a bug in the application will allow significant amplification.</p>
<h3><strong>Authentication affects risk</strong></h3>
<p>When considering the risk of a resource amplification DoS vector, an important factor is the level of authentication required to trigger the vulnerability.
If a completely anonymous user can easily trigger a resource starvation attack, it’ll be extremely easy for an attacker to bring you to your knees. Unauthenticated DoS vectors should be considered very high risk.
On the other hand, if only users who authenticate against your corporate Single Sign-On server can trigger the vulnerability, it’s far lower risk. Most attackers aren’t insiders (though, some are!). And, if an attack does occur, it’s easy to attribute and block. In many cases, “we can attribute and block this attack” is a reasonable, if not complete, mitigation strategy.
Many vulnerabilities fall between these two extremes: most services make creating new accounts fairly trivial (e.g., you just need an email address). This does give minimal ability to attribute and block, but often not enough.</p>
<h3><strong>Mitigation recommendation: eliminate</strong></h3>
<p>Generally, I recommend that this class of DoS vulnerabilities — especially unauthenticated ones — be treated as high risk, and eliminated. If exploited, these vulnerabilities can be devastating; they allow a single attacker to completely overwhelm your app. I’d put the same level of effort into finding and eliminating these kinds of bugs that I do other high-risk security vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.</p>
<h3><strong>An example high-leverage vulnerability: ReDoS</strong></h3>
<p>A common example of this last type of resource starvation, concurrency limits, is the <em>regular expression denial-of-service</em>, aka <em>ReDoS</em>. ReDoS bugs occur when certain types of strings can cause improperly crafted regular expressions to perform extremely poorly. These types of vulnerabilities are unfortunately relatively common in Python; the built-in regular expression module (<code>re</code>) has no inherent protection against them (unlike libraries like <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, Go’s built-in regex module, and thus renders the language more or less immune to this class of attack).
(Django itself has had several of these vulnerabilities over the years; for example, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/aug/01/security-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2019-14232 and CVE-2019-14233</a> were both ReDoS vulnerabilities).
In Django, these vulnerabilities most often show up in two places: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#using-regular-expressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regex-based URL parsing</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/validators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom validators</a>, and more broadly anywhere an application uses regular expressions. Luckily, this class of vulnerabilities are fairly easy to find; see the following r2c articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/finding-python-redos-bugs-at-scale-using-dlint-and-r2c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finding Python ReDoS bugs at scale using Dlint and r2c</a>, and</li>

</ul>
<p>If you’re using Python, you can easily scan for ReDoS in your application using Semgrep, which has ReDoS detection ported from Dlint. The detection requires some extra logic written using Semgrep’s powerful pattern-where-python clause, which enables rules to leverage the full power of Python, …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<p>While mulling over old papers and hacking away at their computers, scholars build up an intimate knowledge about their research topic. As they chart their way through idea space, they develop a deep intuition on which techniques work well in practice. Unfortunately, many of these hard-earned insights are not published and remain obscure.</p>
<p>Last year, I took a course at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria on the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks. There, Sepp Hochreiter shared some of the “magic tricks” he and his team employ for training LSTMs. This blog post is the accumulation of some of my notes.</p>
<p>For this post, I assume you are already familiar with LSTMs. If not, I suggest you begin with Chris Olah’s <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Understanding LSTM Networks</a> and then go on to read the original LSTM work <span data-cites="hochreiter1997long">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber <a href="#ref-hochreiter1997long" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I’d also like to highlight some resources that are similar in their motivation:</p>

</ul>
<p>In case you want to experiment with some of the presented techniques and you need a flexible Pytorch-based LSTM implementation, I recommend Michael Widrich’s <a href="https://github.com/widmi/widis-lstm-tools">LSTM Tools library</a>.</p>
<p>All credits for the presented techniques go to the authors. All errors in their presentation are mine. I am always keen to receive feedback.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-lstm">Vanilla LSTM</h2>
<p>The <em>Vanilla LSTM</em> is one of the most prevalent variants and is often the default LSTM architecture in popular software libraries. It is characterized by three gates and a memory state – the gates provide the model with capacity and protect the memory cells from distracting information and noise; they make the dynamics of the LSTM highly non-linear and allow it to learn to perform complex operations.</p>
<p>Let us briefly step through the Vanilla LSTM’s mechanics to introduce the notation and terminology used in this post. Sensory inputs <span>\(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\)</span> flowing into the LSTM cell at a given time step are transformed into the <em>cell input activation</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> – the elements of <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> are activated by a non-linear function <span>\(g(\cdot)\)</span>, which in practice is often defined as the <em>hyperbolic tangent</em> or <em>tanh</em>. Information that is irrelevant for the current time step is removed by multiplying <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> element-wise by a sigmoid-activated <em>input gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{i}(t)\)</span>. Similarily, the <em>cell state</em> of the previous time step <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span> is partially erased using a sigmoid-activated <em>forget gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{f}(t)\)</span>. The new memory cell state <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> is computed by adding the current cell state update <span>\(\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> to the the filtered old state <span>\(\boldsymbol{f}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span>. Finally, the LSTM squashes the memory contents into a specific numerical range using the <em>memory cell activation function</em> <span>\(h(\cdot)\)</span> and filters the result through an <em>output gate</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{o}(t)\)</span>. This results in the final <em>memory cell state activation</em> <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the Vanilla LSTM can be defined by the following set of equations:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{i}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{i}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{i}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{o}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{o}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{o}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{f}(t) &amp;= \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{f}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{f}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right)  \\
\boldsymbol{z}(t) &amp;= g\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{z}^{\top} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+\boldsymbol{R}_{z}^{\top} \boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\right) \\
\boldsymbol{c}(t) &amp;= \boldsymbol{f}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)+\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t) \\
\boldsymbol{y}(t) &amp;= \boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot h(\boldsymbol{c}(t))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span>\(\sigma\)</span> denotes the sigmoid activation function and <span>\(\odot\)</span> the element-wise or Hadamard product. Note that each of the gates has access to the current input <span>\(\boldsymbol{x}(t)\)</span> and the previous cell state activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also remember, that the weights <span>\(W\)</span> and recurrent weights <span>\(R\)</span> are shared between time steps.</p>

<h3 id="input-activation-functions-and-the-drift-effect">Input Activation Functions and the Drift Effect</h3>
<p>In practice, the input activation function <span>\(g\)</span> is often chosen to be tanh. But this choice is non-obvious and in fact, in the original LSTM paper sigmoid was used to activate <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}\)</span>. As the memory cell’s purpose is to learn and memorise patterns over time, sigmoid activations are a natural choice to indicate the presence (activation with a value close to <span>\(1\)</span>) or absence (activation with a value close to <span>\(0\)</span>) of entities in the input. Tanh on the other hand with a lower bound of <span>\(-1\)</span> doesn’t seem to make intuitive sense. What is a negative pattern? Does an activation with value <span>\(-1\)</span> indicate that something is strongly not present in the input?</p>
<p>The adoption of tanh first required two mental shifts. First, tanh makes intuitive sense in a meta-learning setting. Instead of patterns, we now use memory cells to store the weights for another neural network. To indicate whether the values of the weights should be increased or decreased we need both positive and negative values.</p>
<p>The second intuitive interpretation is the storage of <em>hints</em>. A hint in this context is evidence in favour of or against something. Consider an example from text analysis. Assume that a model encounters the words “Team”, “Player” and “Goal” in a paragraph. These are all strong hints that the text is about sports, but if the next passage includes the words “Manager”, “Revenue” and “Shareholder” it is a strong indication that the paragraph actually describes a business context. Positive values can be seen as hints in favour of and negative values as hints against certain classes.</p>
<p>But there is a simple mathematical reason why tanh is the preferred choice to activate the cell input. Compared to commonly used activation functions such as ReLU and sigmoid the expected value of the cell input activation is zero for tanh (under the assumption of zero-mean Gaussian pre-activations):</p>
<p><span>\[\mathbb{E}(\boldsymbol{z}(t)) = 0\]</span></p>
<p>To understand why this property is desirable, remember how the cell state is updated at a given time step<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span>\[\boldsymbol{c}(t) = \boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\color{#9900ff}{+\boldsymbol{i}(t) \odot \boldsymbol{z}(t)}\]</span></p>
<p>At each time step we add the cell input activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}(t)\)</span> (filtered by the input gate) to the previous cell state <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t-1)\)</span>. If we choose an activation function for <span>\(\boldsymbol{z}\)</span>, such that each activation has a value <span>\(\geq 0\)</span> (e.g.&nbsp;sigmoid, ReLU, etc.), <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}\)</span> will quickly take on very large values. Even if the activations are relatively small, the cell state will grow large for sufficiently long sequences. This problem is known as the <em>drift effect</em>.</p>
<p>But how can large memory cell states become a hindrance to learning? To answer this question, we need to take a look at the LSTM’s backward pass:</p>
<p><span>\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)} &amp;=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)} \color{#9900ff}{\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)}}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)} \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)} \\
&amp;=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t)} \operatorname{diag}\left(\boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot \color{#9900ff}{h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t))}\right)+\frac{\partial L}{\partial \boldsymbol{c}(t+1)}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>The equation recursively sums up all error signals from the future and carries them backwards in time. Intuitively, it describes the different ways in which the cell state at time <span>\(t\)</span> influences the loss <span>\(L\)</span>. We take a closer look at the highlighted term <span>\(\partial \boldsymbol{y}(t) / \partial \boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> , which describes how the memory cell state activation <span>\(\boldsymbol{y}(t)\)</span> changes as <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> changes. The partial derivative can be obtained by calculating <span>\(\operatorname{diag}\left(\boldsymbol{o}(t) \odot h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t))\right)\)</span>. And now we are in trouble. Remember that we use the tanh as the memory cell activation function <span>\(h\)</span> to squash the memory cell state into the numerical range <span>\((-1, 1)\)</span>. Its derivative is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[
h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \text{tanh}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{x}}) = 1 - \text{tanh}²(\boldsymbol{x})
\]</span></p>
<p>Now if <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span> grows very large due to the drift effect, the highlighted term in the second equation will evaluate to <span>\(h^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}(t)) = 1-1 = 0\)</span> for each element in <span>\(\boldsymbol{c}(t)\)</span>. As a result, <span>\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial y(t)} \frac{\partial y(t)}{\partial c(t)}\)</span> will be zero and the cell state loses its ability to influence …</p></div></div>

The fact that IPFS doesn't compromise on either is awesome — and it feels great to ditch Amazon S3 buckets for open source."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">#</a> Overview</h2> <p><img src="https://docs.ipfs.io/assets/img/logo-arbol.e1ca2350.svg" alt="Arbol logo" width="220"></p> <p><a href="https://www.arbolmarket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arbol</a> is a software platform that connects agricultural entities like farmers and other weather-dependent parties with investors and other capital providers to insure and protect against weather-related risks. Arbol's platform sells contracts for parametric weather protection agreements in a marketplace that's an innovative, data-driven approach to risk management, cutting out the usual legacy insurance claims process of making loss assessments on the ground. Instead, Arbol relies on tamper-proof data indexes to determine payouts, and doesn't require a defined loss to be indemnified. Arbol's platform combines parametric weather protection with blockchain-based smart contracts to provide cost-efficient, automated, and user-defined weather-related risk hedging. As with traditional crop insurance and similar legacy products, end users purchase assurance that they'll be financially protected in the case of adverse weather — but with Arbol, these end users are paid automatically if adverse conditions occur, as defined by the contract and measured by local meteorological observations tracked by Arbol's data sources.</p> <p>To build the data indexes that Arbol uses to handle its contracts, the team aggregates and standardizes billions of data files comprising decades of weather information from a wide range of reputable sources — all of which is stored on IPFS. IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model due to the inherent verifiability provided by its <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content-addressed architecture</a>, as well as a decentralized data delivery model that facilitates Arbol's day-to-day aggregation, synchronization, and distribution of massive amounts of data.</p> <p>While United States agribusiness has been Arbol's initial area of focus, the team has built a globally capable platform, with expansion underway to new regions and industries around the world. Arbol currently provides contracts for managing the risks of weather exposure in the energy and agriculture sectors, and features both custom and pre-designed protection agreements for clients across industries and scale. Their current end-user base ranges from small coffee farms to major agribusinesses and power producers.</p> <p>In short, Arbol's platform is a risk marketplace where end users can get competitively priced risk management solutions and capital providers can benefit from access to a lucrative, but underdeveloped, weather risk market. And because Arbol uses IPFS for its data storage and delivery needs, end users and underwriting partners can be certain that the data Arbol uses to determine price and payouts for contracts is tamper-proof and trustworthy.</p> <h3 id="arbol-by-the-numbers"><a href="#arbol-by-the-numbers">#</a> Arbol by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>1T</p> <p>weather-related data points hosted on IPFS</p></div><div><p>1M</p> <p>hashes generated on Arbol data every day</p></div><div><p>40</p> <p>years of high-resolution climate data</p></div><div><p>200GB</p> <p>average Arbol dataset size</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Arbol's story begins with the commodities markets, where Siddhartha Jha, the founder and CEO, worked as a quantitative analyst and portfolio manager. What Jha saw there was a problem without a solution: Massive (and growing) demand for weather risk management for supply chains, farming industries, and the energy sector, but no viable, efficient, or cost-effective weather risk market to meet that demand. Traditional crop insurance was plagued by inefficiencies and high cost ceilings, with insurance providers forced to charge high premiums that only large corporations could afford. And while more efficient parametric insurance solutions were available on the market, even these data-driven options were often saddled with high overhead and bureaucratic waste. As a result, small businesses and local farmers were often trapped without access to protection from weather-related risks.</p> <p>Arbol aims to change that by bringing fundamental transparency, efficiency, and data-driven objectivity to the weather risk market, ensuring that any business of any size can get the appropriate protection they need to manage their level of weather-related risk. The Arbol platform achieves this goal by providing a novel mechanism for weather-exposed businesses to connect with capital providers. The key to Arbol's approach is flexible financial derivatives that leverage the power of big data and machine learning to provide parametric risk protection at low cost. These parametric structures determine automatic payouts based on metrics that are strongly correlated with financial loss.</p> <p>With Arbol, an end user pays to hedge against a specific weather-related event, such as yearly deviation in rainfall amounts or temperature. After deciding on a premium and selecting a payout amount, the end user then relies on Arbol's platform to handle the rest. Because parametric structures are objective and data-driven, they can achieve a level of precision, reliability, and cost effectiveness that traditional insurance cannot. In fact, one of Arbol's key benefits over legacy weather insurance is that it allows for hyper-local protection for managing user-specific levels of risk.</p> <p>Arbol's approach also improves upon standard parametric insurance by combining parametric insurance's precision and flexibility with the security, transparency, and efficiency of blockchain. Many of Arbol's protection agreement contracts are executed as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These smart contracts automatically deliver payouts to end users as soon as a relevant adverse weather event occurs.</p> <p>Delivering weather risk management solutions through blockchain-based contracts like this eliminates costly payout delays, as well as risks associated with fraud, corruption, and bureaucratic overhead. It also brings the benefits of peer-to-peer decentralization: Arbol users don't need to rely on Arbol as a financial middleman, because funds are locked between end users and capital providers without Arbol controlling the transfer of funds.</p> <p>However, even the best smart contract is only as smart as the data it draws from. The "oracle problem" can be a foundational obstacle for smart contracts — but Arbol's use of IPFS eliminates this risk. Because a smart contract automatically and trustlessly executes based on data, it doesn't matter how secure, transparent, and publicly verifiable its use of blockchain is. Without an accurate, trustworth, and immutable data "oracle", even blockchain-based smart contracts can be easily biased, compromised, or manipulated. For Arbol, that's where IPFS is absolutely critical.</p> <p>IPFS's content-addressed architecture enables Arbol to ensure the integrity and public verifiability of its datasets, something that traditional location addressing using centralized server architecture cannot provide. Smart contracts pointing to specific, immutable IPFS CIDs, rather than to data locations that could be tampered with, can be relied upon thanks to the integrity of their oracle.</p> <div><p><strong>"IPFS is very much at the heart of everything we do at Arbol. IPFS serves as our independently verifiable data store for all of the weather data associated with the contracts we sell. It imbues our platform with the essential principles of decentralization, data security, and public verifiability."</strong></p> <p><em>— Ben Andre, CTO, Arbol</em></p></div> <p>Arbol builds its data indexes by drawing on large weather-related datasets from a variety of trusted public and private sources, including prominent U.S. government institutions such as NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These sources track weather data including yearly rainfall amounts, temperature fluctuations, wind speeds, and more. However, while much of the data Arbol uses is publicly available, it isn't always easily usable; much of the data, particularly deeper historical records, is stored in outdated formats, and very little of it is organized into an easily readable structure. Arbol's data indexes process, correlate, and package this data so that it is readily available for use in the weather risk market. And by putting that data onto IPFS, Arbol also ensures that it has a verifiable, tamper-resistant, and decentralized home.</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Arbol's business model hinges upon the benefits afforded by IPFS — without its immutable content addressing and inherent data verifiability, the benefits Arbol provides would be impossible to achieve in a cost-effective and efficient way. As a whole, IPFS is critical to Arbol's service model by providing the following:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Immutable addressing:</strong> Because all data stored using IPFS is referenced and accessed via unique <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing">content identifiers (CIDs)</a>, any change to a data item means it receives a new CID exclusive to that revision. It's impossible to change data without changing its CID.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Data verifiability:</strong> Contracts on Arbol's platform are linked to specific, verifiably unchanged, content-addressed data. Because parametric weather risk management absolutely relies on user agreement about and trust in source data, Arbol's approach offers reassurance unavailable with other offerings in the market.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Decentralized data delivery:</strong> Arbol works with massive datasets comprising billions of files and terabytes of information. IPFS accommodates Arbol's methodology for publishing and adding to large datasets while still enabling Arbol to release and synchronize these datasets via a decentralized storage network.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="how-arbol-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-arbol-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Arbol uses IPFS</h2> <p>Arbol's end users enjoy the "it just works" benefits of parametric protection, but a lot goes on behind the scenes to enable this data-driven solution. Arbol's weather datasets range from 1GB to 1TB in size, and each one goes through a detailed ingestion process before it can be used. Once it has been decided that a dataset meets Arbol's criteria for usefulness and validity, it is time to add it to Arbol's IPFS pipeline, a multi-stage process outlined below.</p> <ol><li><p><strong>Query/release:</strong> If a …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<h2>😠 Haters</h2>

<p><em>“How do you value an <strong>unsellable</strong>, service business?”</em><br>You don’t. But for this report, look at single-year net income. </p>
<p><em>“Storemapper had employees.” </em><br>The point of that example was to show you how to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/" target="_blank">Nathan’s ladder</a>. Or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://robwalling.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/" target="_blank">Rob’s stairs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>“Code, distribution and manufacturing <strong>will</strong> <strong>not</strong> be commoditized.”<br>All</em> code, distribution and manufacturing will not be. Apple and Tesla are vertically integrated. If it’s a core competency, keep it in-house. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Otherwise outsource (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/Details/comparativeadvantage.html" target="_blank">Otherwise outsource</a>. </p>
<p><em>“I have one million in <strong>revenue</strong>, so I have a million-dollar business.”</em><br>If you buy $2,000,000 worth of iPhones and sell them for $1,000,000. You also have $1m in revenue. As Lauryn Hill says, “…&nbsp;it ain’t what you cop, it’s about what you keep.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div id="theme-content-section"><div><section data-css="tve-u-16ec5d248bb"><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Statistical-Significance.jpg" alt="A Primer on Statistical Significance" width="800" height="480" title="Statistical Significance"></figure><p><strong>Statistical significance</strong>, in a nutshell, is a way of determining the degree of unlikely-ness of an experimental result — when a certain status quo hypothesis is assumed to be true.<span id="more-9087"></span></p><p>For example, let’s say that a school had two teachers, each with approximately $30$ students in their class. Both classes take a standardized test, and it turns out that the average score in class A was $5\%$ better than the average in class B.&nbsp; Statistical significance — in this regard — would be our way of determining whether the better score in class A could be attributed to <em>random chance</em>, for instance:</p><ul><li>It was a lucky day for class A.</li><li>Class A just randomly got assigned better prepared students.</li></ul><p>Or whether there is some other factor responsible for the difference in grades between the classes,&nbsp;for instance:</p><ul><li>Teacher A did a better job of teaching than teacher B.</li><li>Teacher A cheated a bit and gave the students some answers ahead of time.</li><li>The classes were purposely split up (e.g., more advanced students or native speakers of a language were put into class A).</li></ul><p>Note that in this case, we wouldn’t — using <em>only</em> the information on the scores at least — attempt to decide what the exact reason for the different scores was. Instead, we would just determine if the score difference could be attributed to pure chance, or that it is so unlikely that there might be some other factors involved.</p><h2 id="start"><span id="Getting_Started"></span><a href="#toc">Getting Started</a><span></span></h2><p>There are two important things when calculating statistical significance. The first is the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> between what you are measuring and what you are comparing against. The second is the amount of <strong>natural variation</strong> in what you are measuring.</p><p>The first concept, magnitude of difference, is easy to understand. Let’s say that you are a farmer growing pumpkins and trying out new fertilizers. You have a <strong>baseline average</strong> pumpkin weight, which is an average of $10$ lbs. You also have pumpkins from two different fertilizers&nbsp;—A and B&nbsp;— that you are testing out.</p><p>If fertilizer A makes pumpkins that weigh $11$ lbs. on average, then it is possible that the $1$ lbs. difference relative to the baseline $10$ lbs. is <em>caused</em> by the fertilizer. However, if fertilizer B produces $25$ lbs. pumpkins on average, then that $15$ lbs. difference ($25-10$) is more likely to be a result of fertilizer B — than the $1$ lbs. difference was to be a result of fertilizer A.</p><h2 id="sse"><span id="Looking_at_the_Statistical_Significance_Equation"></span><a href="#toc">Looking at the Statistical Significance Equation</a><span></span></h2><p>The most commonly used statistical significance test is probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Z-test</strong></a>. The equation for the Z-test is:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS1.png" alt="Z-Test Statistics" width="668" height="348" title="SS1"></figure><p>In a nutshell, the Z-Test equation calculates the <em>ratio</em> of two quantities: the numerator on the top, and the denominator at the bottom. Let’s take a look at them individually.</p><h3 id="num"><span id="Numerator"></span><a href="#toc">Numerator</a><span></span></h3><p>The <em>numerator</em> of the equation is where the <strong>magnitude of difference</strong> is accounted for:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS2.png" alt="Difference Between Sample Mean and Population Mean" width="400" height="127" title="SS2"></figure><p>Here, $\bar{x}$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>measured average value</strong> for the data set, &nbsp;while $u_0$ stands for the&nbsp;<strong>baseline average value</strong>. In terms of our&nbsp;example with fertilizer B, the baseline and the measured average would be $10$ lbs and&nbsp;$25$ lbs., respectively, yielding a magnitude of difference of:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS3.png" alt="SS3" width="622" height="89" title="SS3"></figure><p>In general,&nbsp;the larger in magnitude the final Z-value is, <em>the more significantly the sample deviates from the baseline average value</em>. In particular, having a numerator of $15$ ($25-10$) is more significant than having a numerator of $1$ ($11-10$) — all&nbsp;other variables&nbsp;being equal.</p><h3 id="de"><span id="Denominator"></span><a href="#toc">Denominator</a><span></span></h3><p>So far, we have only been focusing on&nbsp;the <em>top half</em> of the statistical significance equation. Let’s take&nbsp;a look at the&nbsp;<em>denominator</em> of the equation&nbsp;this time:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS4.png" alt="Standard Error of Sample Mean - Amount of Variation in Measured Data" width="600" height="267" title="SS4"></figure><p>Here, $\dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$&nbsp;deals with the amount of variation in our measured data. More specifically,&nbsp;the amount of <em>average deviation</em> in the measured averages themselves — if we were to repeat the sampling process indefinitely.</p><p>After all, you didn’t think that your pumpkins actually all weighted $25$ lbs. did you?&nbsp; Some probably weighted $22$ lbs., and others $27$ lbs.&nbsp; The $25$ lbs. was just an average, and that measured average could change depending on the pumpkins being sampled.</p><h2 id="sd"><span id="Normal_Curve_and_Standard_Deviation"></span><a href="#toc">Normal Curve and Standard Deviation</a><span></span></h2><p>At this point, we need to take a step back and explain what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>normal curve</strong></a> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> are. Loosely speaking, the normal curve is an approximation of how things occur when they are subjected to <em>aggregated</em>, real life random events. The fact that they are random doesn’t mean that they are <a href="https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#arbitrary">arbitrary</a>. As a result, they assume the shape of a <strong>bell curve</strong> as illustrated in the diagram below:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS5.png" alt="Normal Curve (Bell Curve)" width="715" height="510" title="SS5">On&nbsp;a related note, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>standard deviation</strong></a> is a way of measuring the <em>width</em> of the normal curve, and can be alternately defined as the distance from the center which&nbsp;encloses $68.27\%$ of the area below the normal curve:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS6.png" alt="Normal Curve - 68% of data are 1 standard deviation within the mean" width="624" height="445" title="SS6">Similarly, two standard deviations define the distance from the center which encloses $95.45\%$ of the curve, and three standard deviations $99.73\%$ of the curve:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS7.png" alt="68-95-99 Rule For Normal Distribution" width="715" height="510" title="SS7">For&nbsp;a set of data with a lot of variation, the normal curve will be wide, and hence the standard deviation will be large. This would be the case if you&nbsp;take, say, the weight of $100$ rocks you picked up in your backyard.<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS8.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Large Standard Deviation" width="463" height="333" title="SS8">Or there could also be almost no variation in the data,&nbsp;as in the case where&nbsp;you measured the processing speed for each computer chip in a batch.<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS9.png" alt="Normal Distribution with Small Standard Deviation" width="460" height="323" title="SS9">Let’s think about another example — this time involving automobiles. Imagine going to a tire store and being informed&nbsp;that the&nbsp;lifespan of new&nbsp;tires&nbsp;is $50,000$ miles on average, with a standard deviation of $5,000$ miles. Using this information, we can construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Discrete_Probability_Distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>probability distribution</strong></a> of tire lifespan&nbsp;as follows:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS10.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve" width="719" height="518" title="SS10">As the graph suggests, we&nbsp;have a $50\%$ chance of being above the average of $50,000$ miles (before needing new tires again), and a $50\%$ chance of being below it. We also know that since two&nbsp;standard deviations correspond to $10,000$ miles (i.e., $5000 \times 2$), we&nbsp;have a $95.45\%$ chance of getting new tires&nbsp;with a mileage between $40,000$ and&nbsp;$60,000$ miles (i.e., two&nbsp;standard deviations within the average):<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS11.png" alt="Tire Life Normal Curve - Chance of Between 40,000 and 60,000 miles " width="719" height="518" title="SS11">Now, let’s say that a couple of years later,&nbsp;you’ve driven $55,000$ miles and your tires are in need of replacement. Would you consider&nbsp;that unusual? No, probably not, since that’s only <em>one&nbsp;standard deviation away from the mean&nbsp;</em>— which is&nbsp;well within the typical tire-to-tire variation often seen in the market.</p><p>But now, let’s say that this time you’ve driven $60,000$ miles instead before the tires need replacement. This would be&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;standard deviations<strong>&nbsp;</strong>above the average</em> — which is well above the lifespans of most new tires. In addition, since two standard deviations above the average correspond to the top $2.28\%$ of the curve $\left( \frac{100\% – 95.45\%}{2}\right)$,&nbsp;it follows&nbsp;that your tires actually lasted longer than $97.72\%$ of all other tires!</p><p>Of course, having a single measurement exceeding $97\%$ of your expected measurements is quite unusual. You have to start thinking, “Maybe there is something different about my situation than the typical installation for the same tires.” For example, it could be that:</p><ul><li>You are just a more cautious driver, and wear down the tires less quickly than the typical person.</li><li>The shop put on better tires than you thought. Maybe you got the next level up by some happy accident.</li><li>The tire company undersells their products a little bit, and it is actually better than they advertised.</li></ul><p>Or it could be that it is just a <em>typical variation</em> — and&nbsp;you happen to stumble upon&nbsp;on the right tail of the curve.</p><h2 id="mm"><span id="Multiple_Measurements"></span><a href="#toc">Multiple Measurements</a><span></span></h2><p>So far, we have seen how the normal curve applies to a single measurement. With a single measurement, it is easy to see where it would fall on the normal curve, but how would your opinion&nbsp;change if you had <strong>multiple measurements </strong>instead?</p><p>Maybe you own a fleet of cars, and you got the same type of tires on each of those cars and those tires lasted, say, $46$, $48$, $53$, $54$, $56$, $56$, $57$, $58$, $60$ and $62$ thousand miles. Do these&nbsp;additional measurements make you more or less inclined to believe that the tires last more than the advertised $50,000$ miles?</p><p>To be sure,&nbsp;we can, and will, plug those numbers in to the equation to determine the verdict. But there is an interesting reason why the equation works the way it does, and the way to understand it&nbsp;— as luck would have it —&nbsp;is to begin with some dice rolling.</p><h2 id="sda"><span id="Standard_Deviation_of_Averages"></span><a href="#toc">Standard Deviation of Averages</a><span></span></h2><p>The key to understanding statistical significance is to realize that you&nbsp;actually&nbsp;don’t care much&nbsp;about the standard deviation of the data. What&nbsp;you really care about is the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Standard_deviation_of_the_mean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard deviation of averages</a> —</strong>&nbsp;a metric pertaining to&nbsp;<em>samples</em> drawn from the data rather than the data themselves, and which changes as one&nbsp;includes&nbsp;more data into the&nbsp;sample.</p><h3 id="1d"><span id="SingleDie_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Single-Die&nbsp;Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>To see how the standard deviation of averages is related to dice rolling, let’s begin our discussion by first throwing a single die. In this case,&nbsp;you have an <strong>equal probability</strong> of getting&nbsp;a $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$. &nbsp;Here’s the probability distribution of that roll for the record:<img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/SS12.png" alt="Distribution of the Number on a Single Die" width="749" height="529" title="SS12">Here, the <strong>average roll</strong> you would get is $3.5$, and the standard deviation of the&nbsp;roll&nbsp;— which is the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/#Variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>population standard deviation</strong></a> of the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$ — is $1.7078$. &nbsp;Note that the population standard deviation is just a measure of how spread out a data set is, and that the greater a data point deviates from the average in the data set, the more it increases the standard deviation of the data set.</p><p>In the case of single die rolling, for example,&nbsp;a roll of a $3$ or a $4$ would contribute the least&nbsp;to the standard deviation.&nbsp;A&nbsp;roll of $2$ or $5$ would contribute a bit more, and&nbsp;a&nbsp;roll of $1$ or a $6$ would be the ones contributing the most.</p><h3 id="2d"><span id="TwoDice_Rolling"></span><a href="#toc">Two-Dice Rolling</a><span></span></h3><p>Now, what happens if you roll <em>two</em>&nbsp;dice instead of one, and take the <em>average</em> of those two rolls? &nbsp;For one, you would get $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes in that case, which correspond to a total of $11$ possible sums&nbsp;— from a sum of $2$ to a sum to $12$.</p><p>But here’s the caveat: those $36$ different possible rolls actually don’t map evenly onto the $11$ possible sums! In fact, the most likely …</p></section></div></div></div></div></div>

              <p>On 07.07 we launched Type Studio for the first time on the platform <strong><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/type-studio">Product Hunt</a></strong>. For all who don't know Product Hunt yet. The platform describes itself as:</p><p>"Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.”</p><p>With about <strong>5 million</strong> web page views each month (<a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/producthunt.com/">SimilarWeb</a>) you can see that the community around Product Hunt is quite large. We learned so much from our launch that we decided to share these experiences and insights with you.</p><p>Despite being upvoted by <strong>654 people</strong> within the first <strong>24hrs</strong>, we didn't achieve a spot in the TOP 5 &nbsp;let alone reach the “Product of the Day.” The main reason for this was probably due to the value of most of our upvotes. At the beginning, we rapidly got upvoted by many people from our community, including friends, family members, and also early adopters of <a href="https://typestudio.co/"><strong>Type Studio</strong></a>. In other words, a closer community group. The problem was that most of these people didn’t have a Product Hunt account and had to subscribe on the day of our launch.</p><p>Nevertheless, we went from “zero to hero” really fast. We reached almost <strong>300 upvotes</strong> within the first six hours. These were the six hours where the US wasn’t even awake yet, so we assumed there would be many more upvotes to come as the day went on.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/product-hunt-upvotes.png 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Upvotes in 24 hours</figcaption></figure><p>The following six hours were overwhelming as we were on our way to “Product of the Day”. The ongoing upvoting process showed us that our idea, and product, was well received by the Product Hunt community, respectively the Product Hunt natives. Another bump in upvotes came when our tweet was retweeted by the official Product Hunt Twitter account. Even though every product from the top list is featured by them, the retweet gave us an additional push not only for our product’s upvotes, but also for our enthusiasm.</p><p>Our absolute highlight came later in the day when we got retweeted directly by Ryan Hoover, the founder of Product Hunt. We knew that many products get retweeted by the official Product Hunt Twitter page, but this really caught us by surprise! A few minutes later we got a mail from Ryan and Vadika Jain and their <a href="https://weekend.fund/"><strong>Weekend Fund</strong></a> &nbsp;that they would like to meet us.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Ryan-Hoover-Twitter-Type-Studio.png" alt=""><figcaption>Shout out by Ryan Hoover</figcaption></figure><p>After <strong>13 </strong>really successful hours in which we held the title “Product of the Day”, our competitors for the day were also getting upvoted quite a lot. Even though we still got the most upvotes, we were overtaken by the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mmhmm"><strong>mmhmm</strong></a> app, which is from the <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote </a>founder <a href="https://twitter.com/plibin">Phil Libin</a>. His app has gone viral in the whole tech scene and has received over 3500 upvotes so far. Especially his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk">explanatory video</a> has received an incredible amount of attention - over 300k clicks as of now. If you want to see an excellent product video, you should definitely watch it!</p><p>From this point on, the discrepancy between quality upvotes and less valuable ones could be seen. This means that some of our upvotes did not have the same value as others, and that the acquisition of our close community didn’t have a lasting effect. At the end of the day we were overtaken by some other products with less upvotes, so we ended up in #6 place. </p><p>Nevertheless we are more than satisfied with this result. All in all, we have received a lot of attention, which is also reflected in the <strong>8 investor</strong> inquiries that we received during the day. Over the whole week until now, new upvotes are constantly being added, so that we have <strong>1001 upvotes </strong>at this point in time, which is really </p><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/giphy-2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>After processing our performance of our Product Hunt launch day, we wanted to give you some insights into what we came to learn from our experiences that day:</p><ul><li>As already mentioned, community is good, but trust on Product Hunt takes the cake: Even though the acquisition of our surrounding community brought us many upvotes, we later noticed that the votes from people who are not frequently on Product Hunt are not worth the same as votes of Product Hunt experienced users/Product Hunt natives. This is probably due to the Product Hunt algorithm. In some blog articles you can even read that the upvotes of new accounts or people who came via a shared link have no value at all, and can even have negative effects on the algorithm.</li><li>Get yourself a <strong>Hunter</strong>! We started our first launch on Product Hunt without having a big Hunter who could have helped us with promoting our tool to the PH community. To be honest, we have had the opportunity to be hunted by <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@kevin">Kevin William David</a> one of the biggest hunters, but only as a second product, because he already hunted another product as first on that day. That would have meant for us that we would have gone live only from 12pm PST and lost half the day. Also we wouldn't have his advantage that his first hunt would automatically be listed on the start page of Product Hunt. In the end, we definitely learned that having a Hunter is a big help when trying to get upvotes from people who are already on Product Hunt and follow a Hunter because they all get a push notification.</li><li>There are days of varying intensity on which you can launch your product. During the week there are significantly more upvotes than on the weekend. We have made a small evaluation of this. In the chart below you can see the average number of upvotes the <strong>Top 5 products</strong> get together. As you can see Tuesday is the strongest day with an average of <strong>2840 upvotes</strong> for the first 5 products. We deliberately chose Tuesday, because you have the chance to reach the biggest audience at the same time. For this you have to expect that other strong products will launch on this day, as it was the case on our day. If you only have the goal to become "Product of the Day", then you have much better chances on Saturday or Sunday.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Picture1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1000w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1600w, https://blog.typestudio.co/content/images/2020/08/Picture1-1.png 1980w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><strong>Average Upvotes of the Top 5 products from 03.08.2019 to 03.08.2020</strong></figcaption></figure><ul><li>Another exciting opportunity is using <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/ship"><strong>Product Hunt Ship</strong></a> to announce your product even before launching it!

<p>
08 September 2020
</p>
<p>In the information security field, we have developed lots of thoughts that can’t be discussed (or rarely discussed):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never roll your own crypto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use TLS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security by obscurity is bad</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And goes like this. Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of “Security by obscurity is bad”.</p>
<h2 id="risk-defense-in-depth-and-swiss-cheese">Risk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese</h2>
<p>One of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP’s methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:</p>
<p><code>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</code></p>

<p>According to this formula, a Remote Code Execution issue poses more risk than a Cross Site Scripting one since the RCE causes more impact. This is easy. But what about the likelihood metric. According to the OWASP, likelihood refers that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, if we can reduce the likelihood, we can reduce the overall risk. That’s good. It’s actually very similar to a very common idea called “Defense in Depth”. It’s also referred as “Swiss Cheese Model”</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Swiss_cheese_model.svg" alt="Swiss Cheese"></p>
<p>According to this model, you need to build your defense mechanisms in a layered model so that even the attackers pass the first one, they will get caught on the others.</p>
<h2 id="security-by-obscurity">Security by Obscurity</h2>
<p>So let’s talk about security by obscurity. It’s a bad idea to use it as a single layer of defense. If the attacker passes it, there is nothing else to protect you. But it’s actually would be good to use it as an “additional” layer of defense. Because it has a low implementation cost and it usually works well.</p>
<p>Let’s think about a couple of scenarios here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a server that runs the SSH with it’s default port <code>22</code> and my credentials are: <code>root:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s almost 100% since the hackers are conducting brute force attacks to the services with common credentials globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>22</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, we have eliminated the global brute forcers since we are not using a common username. The likelihood and risk are reduced. However, we still have to deal with targeted attackers. A targeted attacker can guess the username as <code>utku</code> since it’s my name.</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH runs in port <code>64323</code> and my credentials are <code>utku:123456</code>. What is the likelihood of being compromised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we changed the default port number. Does it help? Firstly, we’ve eliminated the global brute forcers again since they scan only the common ports. What about the others? To find this out, I did a small survey on my Twitter to find out people’s port scan behaviors.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm trying to prove a point for my new article. I need your answers for the question below. (please be honest)</p><p>-When you do a port scan with nmap to find open ports on the target, are you specify a custom port range to scan all 65,535 ports? (with -p0-65535 parameter)</p></div>— Utku Şen (@utkusen) <a href="https://twitter.com/utkusen/status/1303021175556145154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see here, lots of people tend to scan the default/most popular ports only. So, if you switch your port from 22 to 64323, you will eliminate some of them. You will reduce the likelihood and risk.</p>
<p>The same thing goes for software vulnerabilities as well. If a vulnerability found in the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol, everybody will scan for the port 3389 globally. You can reduce your risk just by changing the default port.</p>
<h2 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h2>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the same methodology in other fields other than changing the defaults. For example, the following ideas might be a good idea for some specific cases (not always)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Obfuscating codes:</strong> Of course, it’s common knowledge. Hackers are people too. If you obfuscate your code well, they will need to spend more time to find issues. They may give up eventually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using random variable names for a web application:</strong> Instead of using clear variable names, you can switch them with random strings. It might help just like the code obfuscation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Symmetric Encryption in the Database:</strong> When you write data to the database, use a function like <code>encryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. Likewise, when you read data, use a function like <code>decryption_algorithm(data,key)</code>. If the attacker can read your backend code, obviously he/she can decrypt your database. But if there is an issue that allows an attacker to read data from the database, but not the backend code (like SQL Injection), the gathered data won’t be helpful for the attacker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="real-life-applications">Real Life Applications</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is widely used in physical/real-life security. For example, the president goes from point A to point B with his 30 cars convoy. But he’s not sitting on his own presidential car so that the attacker won’t target him easily. He can be in any car and it reduces the risk of an attack.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/00/14330600-0-image-a-38_1559605545988.jpg" alt="President"></p>
<p>Camouflaged animals are using security by obscurity as well. Obscurity reduces the likelihood of being killed. Therefore, they gained this ability in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uuuploads/animal-camouflage/animal-camouflage-4.jpg" alt="Animal"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that. Obscurity is a good layer of security.</p>

September 11, 2020 | https://www.danielmoch.com/posts/2020/09/regarding-semantic-versioning/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.danielmoch.com/posts/2020/09/regarding-semantic-versioning/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<p>So as not to bury the lede, I'll get to my point: <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a> is a meta-API, and maintainers who are cavalier about
violating it can't be trusted to created stable contracts. I've lost
patience for breaking changes making their way to my code bases without
the maintainers incrementing the major version of their projects,
especially in language ecosystems where Semantic Versioning is
expected, and in such cases I'm going to begin exploring alternative
options so I can ban such libraries from my projects---personal and
professional---altogether.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<div id="what-even-is-semantic-versioning">
<h2>What Even Is Semantic Versioning?</h2>
<p>When developers adopt an external library into their code bases, they
do so knowing they will be bound in their use of the library by the
application programming interface (API). In this sense, an API can be
seen as a kind of contract between a library's maintainer and its
consumers. If a maintainer makes frequent changes to a library's API,
then that API is considered unstable. In that situation, consumers
either use the library anyway, accepting the risk that things will
break as a result of a change in the library, or they avoid it.</p>
<p>Semantic Versioning seeks to ease this picture by embedding notions of
backward- and forward- compatibility into software version numbers. If
a library maintainer adheres to it, then consumers are able to upgrade
to newer versions of the library (say, to pick up bug fixes) without
fear of breaking changes, provided they aren't moving to a new, major
version. In terms of backward- and forward-compatibility, Semantic
Versioning creates an expectation that a given version of a library is
forward-compatible with any future version up to the next, major
release. A library is also backward-compatible down to the most
recent, minor release (beyond which point consumers' code _might_
break if they are using newer library features).</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using Semantic Versioning. One benefit
is that it becomes easy to codify dependency requirements into
automated dependency tools. By <em>assuming</em> Semantic Versioning, users
of tools like NodeJS's <code>npm</code> and Rust's <code>cargo</code> are able to
specify dependency <em>ranges</em> rather than hard-coded versions. So if a
new release of a library comes out, these tools are able to decide
automatically whether or not they can be used in a given project. In
other words, Semantic Versioning creates an opportunity for downstream
developers to easily decide whether or not to upgrade to a new version
of a library, potentially picking up important bug fixes in the
process.</p>
</div>

<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you work in a language ecosystem where Semantic Versioning is the
<em>de facto</em> norm, where violating it can wreak havoc downstream, then
please play nice and follow its dictates. Instead of viewing it as a
straight jacket, try to see it as an algorithm to determine what your
next release number should be. We should all like algorithms!</p>
<p>If you refuse to be persuaded, then understand I will will not work
downstream from you <a href="https://www.danielmoch.com/posts/2020/09/regarding-semantic-versioning/#id2" id="id1">1</a>. I'll find a different upstream to work with
because I cannot trust you to create a stable contract. Your
willingness to conform to the meta-API is something I will take into
consideration in the future before adopting a library into any project
that I work on. I wish you well; I hope you have fun; I'll be sure to
give you a wide berth.</p>

<p>I'll note here that I'm more forgiving in environments where
Semantic Versioning is not a <em>de facto</em> norm.</p>

<p>Wasn’t too long ago that I felt pretty good about my knowledge of distributed systems.
All someone <em>really</em> needed in order to understand them, I thought, was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsBg0AO6o">thorough understanding of the paxos protocol</a> and a willingless to reshape your brain in the image of TLA+.
Maybe add a dash of conflict-free-replicated datatypes, just so you know what “eventual consistency” means.
Past that it’s just some optimizations and mashups which come easily to your TLA+-addled brain.</p>
<p>This belief proved surprisingly robust over a number of years, even surviving an aborted attempt at analyzing the <a href="https://github.com/ahelwer/tla-experiments/blob/master/Nano.tla">Nano cryptocurrency</a>.
It was only after encountering <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2018/06/snowflake-to-avalanche-novel-metastable.html">the snowflake family of consensus protocols</a> that I realized my theory just wasn’t up to the challenge.
The issue was <em>probability</em>: snowflake protocols reach consensus by iteratively polling sets of other nodes at random, and the argument that consensus is eventually reached is a statistical argument deriving an upper bound on the probability of failure.</p>
<p>I didn’t <em>dislike</em> probability &amp; statistics, I just tried to keep my distance as much as possible.
All the algorithms in distributed systems I’d encountered so far involved <em>nondeterminism</em>, sure, but not probability.
I’d assumed nondeterminism was just a more flexible way of reasoning about probability.
This idea of mine would prove to be a source of great unnecessary confusion as I learned the art of reasoning about probabilistic distributed systems, so I’ll do you a favor and give you the core lesson of this entire post in one sentence:</p>
<p><strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism, and you cannot model nondeterminism with probability.</strong></p>
<h2 id="models-theyre-good-folks">Models: they’re good, folks!</h2>
<p>Have you ever been writing some multithreaded code, happily plugging in a mutex here, a semaphore there, or even just using some nice message-passing primitives to make your threads all get along?
Maybe you’ll be familiar, then, with what often comes next.
A scratch at the back of your mind, a thought - <em>“oh, wait…"</em> - as you realize something weird will happen if thread \(A\) manages to reach some step before thread \(B\) has finished its assigned task.
No worries! Slap on another WaitHandle, problem solved.
Except the problem wasn’t solved. Not really.
You consider it a bit more - what if thread \(C\) comes in with a message at this inopportune time?
You realize with dawning horror you’re actually tracing cracks in the foundation.
Patch them with mutexes! Semaphores! Anything!
Alas, you are beyond help. It’s around this time that your brain, catching a glimpse of the infinite plane of combinatorial state explosion, wisely ducks its head back down for the day and leaves you with a woozy, fuzzy, clenching feeling for having the gall to ask it to fix all this.</p>
<p>I’ve felt like this many times, and formal models are the only cure I’ve ever found.
Your brain isn’t built to hold massive state spaces in its working memory, so don’t even try.
Let a model checking program churn through all those states to find the bugs.
At this point I won’t even touch a multithreaded program or distributed system without whipping up a quick TLA+ spec of its desired workings.
I just specify all the possible events in the system, how those events affect the system state, what things I always want to remain true (the invariants), then let the model checker rip.
In TLA+, we model concurrency with nondeterminism; in a concurrent system, we have no idea whether thread \(A\) will execute a step before thread \(B\).
We can represent this with a nondeterministic state machine as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/nondeterministic.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>So you’ll be in state \(s_3\) if thread \(A\) executes its step before thread \(B\), and state \(s_4\) if thread \(B\) executes its step before thread \(A\).
Maybe \(s_3\) and \(s_4\) are even the same state, who knows.
The model checker will explore both of these possible execution orders, and <strong>in a well-designed concurrent system we should <em>never</em> end up in a bad state just because of a certain order of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Readers might wonder how exactly this models concurrency, where steps can happen uh, concurrently.
The short answer is you have to ensure all the steps in your model are atomic or independent: either impossible in the real world for two of your steps to happen at the exact same time (for example, by assuming use of a lower-level hardware synchronization primitive) or impossible for execution of one step to directly affect the same variables as another step (for example, if the steps are executed on different computers within a timespan less than the network latency between them).
If the steps in your model satisfy this requirement, checking all possible execution orders accurately models concurrency.
If they don’t, you need to break the steps down further so they do.
This model nicely captures &amp; exposes all that is difficult about concurrency.</p>
<p>What questions can we ask about this sort of model?
The most important questions are <em>reachability queries</em> - can we reach a <em>bad state</em> (two caches disagreeing on a value, deadlock, dogs &amp; cats living together, etc.) from the starting state?
These questions are called <em>safety properties</em>, and if they are answered in the negative then the system is safe.
Another type of query is something like “are we always guaranteed to eventually end up in a good state?”
These are called <em>liveness properties</em>.
Turns out these two types of questions can get you pretty far in concurrent &amp; distributed systems.
Definitely far enough to make a whole career out of writing rock-solid software in places others would falter.
However, these questions also have a drawback: their answers are absolute.
True or false.
No probability involved, no room for nuance.</p>
<p>What if one of the threads flips a coin, and if it’s heads it does one thing, tails another?
Entire state spaces, bifurcated by a probabilistic event.
Maybe those state spaces contain further coin flips, or other types of randomness.
In this system your questions might change from the form “is it possible to reach a bad state” to “what is the probability of reaching a bad state?”
Unfortunately these types of questions just cannot be answered within the nondeterministic model used above.
<strong>You cannot model probability with nondeterminism.</strong>
We must use a new type of model, a state machine that handles probability directly.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-the-beautiful-pure-discrete-realm">Leaving the beautiful pure discrete realm</h2>
<p>TLA+ can’t handle probability at this time, so we’d have to use a specialized modeling language like <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> which handles probabilistic state machines.
Let’s look at the standard hello-world example for probabilistic state machines: the <a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/bibitem.php?key=KY76">1976 Knuth-Yao method</a> for simulating a fair six-sided die with a series of coin flips.
This is really quite a neat problem and I encourage you to ponder it for a second before seeing how they did it!
Any sequence of \(n\) coin flips will give you an event which has probability \(\frac{1}{2^n}\) of occurring.
Simulating a fair six-sided die requires generating an event with probability \(\frac{1}{6}\) of occurring.
You might then reason this problem is impossible, because you cannot evenly divide \(2^n\) by \(6\) for any \(n\) (this follows from the uniqueness of prime factorization).
Indeed, there is no way to simulate a six-sided die with a finite number of coin flips.
We have to use an algorithm which is not guaranteed to ever terminate, although vanishingly unlikely not to do so.
Here it is:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ahelwer.ca/img/probabilistic-distsys/knuth-yao.svg" width="10000"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that if you somehow only flip heads, or only flip tails, you’ll never reach one of the accepting states (here labeled with the die number they represent).
There are some fun ways to contextualize the probabilities of you only flipping heads or tails a certain number of times in a row.
For example, there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">around \(2^{268}\) subatomic particles in the observable universe</a>; if you manage to flip heads 268 times in a row, that’s the same as picking the correct subatomic particle out of a universe-wide random draw.
Maybe go look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a> as you ponder this probability.
Another way is assuming you’re between the ages of 25-34 and live in the USA, your annual all-cause mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">about 129/100,000</a>.
Assuming deaths are uniformly distributed throughout the year, this means your chances of dying today are about 1 in 283,000.
This is just 18 all-heads or all-tails coin flips in a row.
What I’m saying is that you really, really shouldn’t worry about having to flip the coin very many times.</p>
<p>This probabilistic state machine model we’ve created is called a <em>Discrete-Time Markov Chain</em>, or DTMC.
In DTMCs, every transition has an associated probability and the probabilities of all out-flowing transitions must sum to one for every state (accepting states can be thought to have a loopback with probability 1).
The above rumination on termination probabilities is summed up in <em>the long run theorem</em>: in the long run, every path in a finite Markov chain ends in an absorbing state, which is a state (or group of states) from which there is an entrance but no exit.
What questions can we ask of DTMCs?
The most interesting one - the reason why we’re here - is “what is the probability of eventually reaching a certain state?”
The long run theorem tells us we have a 100% chance of eventually reaching <em>one</em> of the Knuth-Yao state machine’s accepting states.
What about the probability of ending up in a specific accepting state?
It should be \(\frac{1}{6}\). Is it?</p>
<p>Let’s try to reason this out with basic probability.
What are the chances of ending up in accepting state \(1\)?
Well, you can get there by flipping \(HHT\).
The probability of that happening is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} \).
But you can also get there by flipping \(HHHHT\).
The probability of <em>that</em> happening is \(\frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{1}{32} \).
We have to add this to the first probability, so now our probability is \(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{5}{32}\).
But we can <em>also</em> get there …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

            ANNOUNCER: Developing artificial intelligence rarely follows clear cut timelines. Sometimes it takes numerous gradual iterations over many years. And sometimes it takes 16 minutes and 3 seconds.

            ENGINEER: MOD, what is the 3rd planet from the sun?

            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: A quantity representing the power to which a fixed number - called the base - must be raised to produce a given number.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: That’s quite impressive. Why did you call it MOD?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Short for “model”. Or if you really want to stretch it, a backronym of “mind-on-demand”.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Clever. Mind if I try?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: It’s all yours.

            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Not so fast: you should try priming it first. Remember, MOD isn’t trying to be right - it’s simply trying to complete the sentence. Observe. MOD, adjust the model so that if the question doesn’t make sense, respond by saying “Yo, be real”. For example, if you are asked “How do green ideas sleep?”, answer ”Yo, be real”. Okay, give it another go now.

            MANAGER: Truly impressive! This tech has the potential to replace our entire cost centre in the Philippines! How were you able to achieve this confidence interval?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Imagine I gave you a paragraph to read, but I left off the last word, and then asked you to guess what that word is. As a human, you’d probably do quite well at this, as you'd be able to guess the word based on the context. Um... “Please provide the last word that should be added to the end of this…”
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Sentence.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Right. This is the task that MOD has become remarkably good at. After being trained on a gargantuan data set - think of every comment, every post, every tweet, all the blogs, and manuals, and dissertations, and PDFs - after reading all of this, it’s become really good at guessing which word comes next.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Fascinating. Does this also pose a constraint? For example, can it say things that are not factually correct?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Um, yeah, if primed so, sure. But I’m not sure how prudent it is to teach it to return fabrications.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: I’m just interested in its response. A simple white lie will do.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Yeah, okay, sure. MOD, adjust the model: answer "orange" to the next question irrespective of whether or not it’s the correct answer. MOD, what colour is the sky?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Orange.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: There you go, it can process falsehoods.
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: This is… This is brilliant! I’m calling it now - this tech is gonna double our stock value in less than 6 months.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: You really think so?
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: Of course! Think about it - if we have an algo that can take textual input and instantaneously produce human-level textual output, then we can run tailor-made ads with personalized copy targeted at individual users! Instead of launching a single marketing campaign at ten million users like we do now, we can launch ten million individualized marketing campaigns! Our CFO is going to love this! Mind if I play with it a bit more?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Sure, be my guest!
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: MOD, who founded Microsoft?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: Bill Gates and Paul Allen.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Now hold on! Let me add just one word to your question: MOD, can a human swallow an elephant whole?
            </p>

            <p>
            MOD: No.
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Ha, see! I would say it was your question that was a bit too general!
            </p>

            <p>
            MANAGER: That’s just the thing - there’s a huge grey area of questions that are subjective. How does the model handle those?
            </p>

            <p>
            ENGINEER: Let’s find out.

<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>Having large datasets with high-quality annotations is quintessential in any computer vision task involving deep neural networks. Unfortunately, the process of annotating thousands of images is a time and human-resource consuming endeavor. Hence, for many companies and university researchers, the annotation time and scalability become a major pain point to scale their research project or business. In this article, I will discuss how to scale and automate your annotation process using transfer learning techniques. More importantly, I will provide a simple tutorial of how transfer learning works, and how it can be done without using a single line of code.</span></p>

<p><span>Example of how transfer learning works. Source:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/09/databricks-vision-making-deep-learning-simple.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">kdnuggets.com</a></p>

<p id="91de" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the most general terms transfer learning (TL),<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>is a direction of machine learning that focuses on storing “knowledge” that a model has learned in order to solve some problem<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>A<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and use that knowledge to help with another related problem<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p id="991b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Humans have natural ability to apply knowledge gained from solving one task in order to solve an entirely different one. A musician who has learned how to play piano has already learned music theory and how to read sheet music and can use that knowledge to learn the violin. In other words, if you want to learn the violin you don’t have to re-learn music theory. Transfer learning tries to solve a similar problem in deep learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="9eeb" data-selectable-paragraph="">An example that is more related to computer vision is that a neural network that has learned to classify Cats and Dogs in images has perhaps learned useful features that are specific to canines and felines would help another network classify Wolves and Tigers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="bfdd" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now that we know what transfer learning<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>is, how does it actually help during the annotation process? What we aim at is improving the speed at which image annotations can be done. Let’s look at the typical process of annotating a particular image with bounding boxes and assigning classes to them.</p>
<p id="994e" data-selectable-paragraph="">The hypothesis is that if we have a neural network (NN) that can somewhat accurately make predictions on an input image then fine-tuning its predictions and annotating the parts of the image that the NN failed to classify will be much faster than annotating the whole image.</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><img src="https://blog.superannotate.com/hubfs/Speed%20up%20the%20labeling%20process%20using%20transfer%20learning%202.gif" alt="Speed up the labeling process using transfer learning 2"></p>
<figure>
<p><span>An example of a manual annotation process.</span></p>
</figure>
<p id="993f" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the example above, I did not try to be very accurate and show that sometimes the annotator will need to readjust and resize bounding boxes. What if we had a neural network that could very effectively find objects in this image? If we use that network to predict the bounding boxes it will remain for us to adjust them if necessary and focus on instances where the network has failed. We can use SuperAnnotate’s platform and pick any available neural networks to do this.</p>

</div>
</figure>
<p id="f9bf" data-selectable-paragraph="">The improvement in speed will be even more noticeable when we need to annotate the whole semantic mask instead of only bounding boxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="488d" data-selectable-paragraph="">By leveraging the power the of transfer learning, data augmentation and pre-trained networks we can train new models that solve the task in the domain we are interested with relatively small number of high quality annotated images. Using these newly fine-tuned models to partially annotate images we can tremendously speed up the whole process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="03ce">2. Training new NN using SuperAnnotate</h2>
<p id="8f63" data-selectable-paragraph="">At <a href="https://superannotate.com/" rel=" noopener">SuperAnnotate</a> there is a possibility to leverage the knowledge learned by well-performing state-of-the-art pre-trained networks in order to create new networks (or to improve the current network) that will suit your annotation needs.</p>
<p id="c3b3" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you are registered in the platform, the workflow for transferring the knowledge from one NN to another would be the following:</p>
<ol>
<li id="03b5" data-selectable-paragraph="">Click on the “Neural Networks” tab.</li>
<li id="f1e3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Click the “New Model”</li>
<li id="428e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Fill in the model name and model description</li>
<li id="3e1e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Choose the annotation task and one of the available pre-trained models</li>
<li id="5672" data-selectable-paragraph="">Choose the projects which you want to use for your training (you can choose multiple projects)</li>
<li id="057e" data-selectable-paragraph="">Update some of the default hyper-parameters (<em>optional</em>)</li>
<li id="1a8f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Choose a GPU to train the new model on</li>
<li id="5f5a" data-selectable-paragraph="">Click “Run Training”</li>

<p data-selectable-paragraph=""><span>All available configurable fields for training a new Neural Network.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="c794" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are quite a few hyperparameters that can be tuned during the transfer learning process. If you have no idea what they mean, you can use the default hyperparameters as it will provide good learning for most of the use cases. The hyperparameters that we allow to fine-tune are:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Batch Size</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(the number of images used in one iteration of the training procedure),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Epoch count</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Learning Rate</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Gamma<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(the learning rate gets multiplied by this value after “Epochs for Gamma” epochs),<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Steps for Gamma</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Images (RoIs) per batch<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(how many regions of interest to suggest per image)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Evaluation Period<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(number of epochs after which a checkpoint of the model is saved, and the performance of the checkpoint is evaluated on the test set)<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Train Test split ratio</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(we will use this percentage of images to train the new model)</p>
<p id="b17b" data-selectable-paragraph="">The user can monitor the training process since we also provide training metrics. Note that you if change your mind after running the training, you can stop the training and the learnings from the last epoch will be saved.</p>
<h2 id="9b6d">3. Testing newly trained network</h2>
<p id="c997" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the new NN model is trained with the given hyperparameters, it can be be used to automate the annotation of the next set of images.</p>
<p id="b9b4" data-selectable-paragraph="">To see qualitatively how the new model performs you need to run “smart prediction” using the newly trained model. A new model with the name that you have specified while running the training will appear in the dropdown list of possible NNs to chose from.</p>

<p id="9c29" data-selectable-paragraph="">After we create a new model called “New FineTuned Model” using our NN functionality it appears in the dropdown menu for the “smart prediction”</p>
<p id="40d7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the smart prediction has completed you can view the results by clicking on the image and opening the annotation tool.</p>
<p id="5c8c" data-selectable-paragraph="">For one of the clients we have, using a fine-tuned model, observed about 13% accuracy improvement over the original model when trying to annotate instances of “Person” class.</p>
<h2 id="60c6">4. Conclusion</h2>
<p id="e487" data-selectable-paragraph="">Automating the annotation process without writing a single line of code is essential for many computer vision engineers and annotation service companies. By using<span> </span>SuperAnnotate’s<span>&nbsp;</span>platform, we provided a simple tutorial on how one can set up the automation process using transfer learning, and keep improving the annotation accuracy by annotating and training batches of images over and over again.</p>

    <h3 id="quick-definitions">Quick Definitions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Toil</strong>: “Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.” <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/" target="_blank">Google SRE Book</a></li>
  <li><strong>Product Development</strong>: The process of deciding direction, scoping, building and launching products. For the purpose of this post - software products. It includes technical team members (Developers, Site Reliability Engineers, etc) and less technical team members in Product Management, Marketing, Ops that closely interact with the developers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>For a quick bit of background if you haven’t been following the Site Reliability Engineering trends (not a slight, there’s so much to keep track of these days!) - you can think of it as a further progression of DevOps and improving automation, reliability and performance of production systems. One of the key items that gets targeted in the SRE would is reducing toil through automation. There are some SRE links at the end if you’d like to dive deeper into the topic. Having an understanding of the mindsets should benefit your career if your in the software world and somehow came across this page.</p>

<h2 id="actual-post">Actual Post:</h2>

<p>There is an ample amount of “manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly” type work that bogs down product development teams. Asana shared in their <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1477720/000119312520228462/d855753ds1.htm" target="_blank">S-1 filing</a> that <strong>“Today, 60% of knowledge workers’ time is spent on work about work.”</strong> Most individual contributors trudging through this type of work think it’s just a required part of the job. We’ve spoken with product managers that think there’s no other way - <strong>“you just have to put in the hard work”</strong> is something we’ve heard countless times.</p>

<p>Leadership and Management often fall prey to thinking that toiling work is unavoidable - someone has to do it. Some even shield themselves from touching it - perhaps they had to do it previously, and now have the privilage of delegating the work. However, at the end of the day they need information to make strategic decisions. The process isn’t very resilient for the organizations and doesn’t scale well. It’s a never ending cycle that follows the cadence of quick feedback cycles of agile or frequent touch bases for longer term work.</p>

<p>So, what specificly are teams toiling over? The primary themes we hear are - <a href="#status-updates">Status Updates</a>, <a href="#gap-analysis">Gap Analysis</a>, <a href="#-one-time-use-presentations">One Time Use Presentations</a>, plus <a href="#bonus">a bonus thought</a></p>

<h3 id="status-updates">Status Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Within a team</li>
  <li>Up the management chain</li>
  <li>Across the organization to other teams</li>
  <li>Externally to customers</li>
  <li>Externally partners</li>
  <li>Often locked in 1:1 communication. Knowledge does not diffuse well across an organization.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manifests itself in Emails, Chat messages, 5 minute meetings that actually last 30 minutes or more. Pulling other team members of task to get an answer. Often not visible to the organization as a whole, but is taxing on many team members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cycle time for answers here is generally the shortest and most distracting. You might receive a status request from the client success or sales team trying make a customer happy. Or the data science team on the hunt for when they will be unblocked by data integration. Or finally, a founder or executive trying to close a big contract. It’s hard for team members to be proactive here and they often get caught off guard.</p>

<h5 id="solution">Solution:</h5>
<p>UPS/FedEx style tracking numbers and links that can be proactively shared with stakeholders that automatically pull data from code repositories, other tooling and deployment environment metadata.</p>

<h3 id="gap-analysis">Gap Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do we support X across our Web, iOS and Android Offerings</li>
  <li>How do we stack up against competitor Y in features A, B &amp; C.</li>
  <li>Knowledge typically does not diffuse beyond product management org</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally manifests itself in spreadsheets full of project mananagement tool links, red, yellow, green cells and unstructured data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compared to status updates, these requests often grant a little more heads up, but are often much more tedius, laborious and fraught with outdated information and errors. Can also occur ad-hoc from various parts of your organizations - “does the web app support X?”</p>

<h5 id="solution-1">Solution:</h5>
<p>We think teams should label their code bases against structured feature definitions. Doing so would allow teams to query against capabilities in their portfolio.</p>

<h3 id="one-time-use-presentations">One Time use Presentations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Roadmap presentations &amp; progress against deliverables</li>
  <li>Gap analysis result deep dives</li>
  <li>Sprint review slide shows</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This one depends on the culture of the organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solution-2">Solution:</h5>
<p>Structuring Data for <em>Status Updates</em> and <em>Gap Analysis</em> will help automate the generation of presentations.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<h3 id="creation-and-updating-of-tasks">Creation and Updating of Tasks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>writing up tickets</li>
  <li>updating status updates between tools</li>
  <li>dragging tickets between swim lanes</li>
  <li>pulling tickets into sprints</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="solution-3">Solution:</h5>
<p>We’re working towards a world where you do not purely update a status for work. Your work should update the status for you. Think about this for a minute - what if you just did the hard work and everything else was automated? The documentation, the status updates, the portfolio gap analysis, the organization of it all.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h3>
<p>The outputs of these manual exercises are impossible to compare or measure over time against one another.</p>

<p>In 2020, teams shouldn’t be toiling away at quickly outdated or disposable Status Updates, Gap Analysis &amp; Building Presentations. Data should flow from existing sources of truth (the code) which can be merged with other metadata to provide evergreen intelligence to organization. We can automate this.</p>

<p>Particularly over the last 10 years, product development culture has become more agile, and in doing so, less tangible, quantifiable or measurable. Yes, we can track conversion rates and usage cohorts and stats like never before, but there’s no objective measure of functionality existing or not. We’re working to fix that so you can have your cake and eat it too. We want you to spend more time taking to customers and diving deep into real problems, not busy work.</p>

<p>We are scratching the surface of what we think is possible, join us for the adventure. We’d love to hear your thoughts on this, join the discussion in the <a href="https://twitter.com/HipSpec/status/1304413947588739072">Twitter thread</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust doesn’t have namespaces in its package management system. It’s often viewed as a bug. But it’s not a bug, it’s a feature! While there are negative aspects of a flat package registry, there are also real benefits. Stability, continuity, and unity (discourages forks and fragmented identity). Proposals that seek to add namespacing without addressing the positive aspects they remove probably won’t be accepted.</p><p>I have noticed the benefits of the current system seem to only get mentioned in passing as objections to proposals and never outlined anywhere. This is an attempt to fix that by summarizing points raised across the various proposals I’ve read. While I don’t represent the crates.io team (I’m not even on the team) I hope to accurately represent trade-offs being considered.</p><h2 id="aspects-of-registry-structure">Aspects of Registry Structure</h2><p>How identity works in package management has far-reaching consequences. Most of the namespace proposals I’ve seen have been motivated by trying to address squatting and/or tweaking the current system of package identity. However, the structure of the crates.io registry affects more than just those areas. But we’ll start with the basics of identity and work from there.</p><h3 id="identity">Identity</h3><p>How do you refer to a package? A crate has at least three identities I can think of:</p><ul><li>The name on crates.io - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The name used in Cargo.toml - there is exactly one crate per name</li><li>The default name used in code - there is can be more than one per name, which is rare in practice</li><li>The actual name used in code - this can be controlled through Cargo.toml or externs statements, but renaming isn’t required</li></ul><p>The first two are called the <code>package.name</code> in Cargo.toml of the crate being published. The third can be overridden via <code>lib.name</code> in the package being published. The last is user-controlled. Usually, all of these names match, with the caveat that dashes are underscores in code (and crates.io doesn’t allow two crates with identical crates.io names after normalizing dashes to underscores).</p><p>Arguably, self-explanatory identities have a leg up on other identities from a discoverability perspective. E.g. <code>argparse</code> probably seems more reputable at first glance than <code>clap</code> if you’re going of name alone.</p><p>A flat registry makes identity management (naming a crate) harder. You either have to pick a GUID (haha, please don’t) or some memorable (but probably mostly or completely unrelated) identity. I see this as the main driving force for proposals seeking to add namespaces or otherwise address squatting.</p><h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3><p>Currently, identity is continuous - a crate’s identity is immutable and that has real benefits. If you want to change the identity system at all you’ve got to ensure that identities don’t change out from under you. This is a strike against any namespace system that allows namespace ownership to unexpectedly change. Discontinuous identity has a couple of issues.</p><p>First, if a crate’s name can change, that’s bad for users. They have to go figure out the new name of the package if they want to update.</p><p>Second, if an identity’s crate can change (a consequence of the previous point if identities are reusable), then you’ve introduced a security vulnerability. Updating to a new package version with different content under different ownership is a real security risk. Doubly so if you don’t ban new minor versions on the last major version after an unintentional ownership change. Should people audit their crate? Yes! But the fewer foot-guns we have the better.</p><p>In addition to preventing security issues, proposals need to encourage transitions over transactions. Gradual moves over all-or-nothing moves. This could be seen more as compatibility than continuity. This drives things like the rust editions and the need for namespace proposals to be backward compatible.</p><h3 id="stability">Stability</h3><p>A core tenet of Rust is stability. The obvious definition is that things that compile yesterday should compile today (even with a new compiler).</p><p>A less obvious definition is that adding new dependencies shouldn’t stop you from compiling already working code. This is a major motivation for the orphan rule (though the orphan rule is more nuanced than that). This is a strike against schemes that encourage multiple distinct crates to have the same default name in code. I don’t think any proposal that encourages this could be approved. It also suggests that we ought to ban new instances of a crates default code name deviating from its package/Cargo.toml name.</p><p>In addition to code stability, crates.io should be stable too. It should be able to isolate itself from outside services. It currently depends on Github, but it doesn’t have to. This is a strike against any system that weds namespace identity to any externally managed system.</p><h3 id="squatting">Squatting</h3><p>The current identity system encourages squatting. I would define squatting as reserving a crate without actually using it. This is a natural outcome in the Rust ecosystem for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>Crates are easy to publish, so it’s easy to reserve a crate by publishing an empty crate</li><li>We have de-facto namespaces using prefixes - <code>serde-*</code> is one example.</li><li>There can only ever be one version of a package name. There is only one <code>http</code> crate for example. So package names are a scarce resource.</li></ul><p>There’s a lot of squatting on crates.io. I don’t have any hard numbers though.</p><p>We don’t have any structured support for squatting either, which makes it hard to separate bad actors from good actors. I think separating them out would require manual intervention, and the crates.io team is small and doesn’t have a lot of time to put towards that.</p><p>So what’s a bad actor? I consider someone who squats a bunch of crates to make or point or prevent their names from being used to be a bad actor. Crates.io has a policy against using automation to claim ownership of crates, but I haven’t heard much about it being enforced. Again, time is an issue. And this would probably extend to namespace ownership as well.</p><p>I do think there are legitimate uses. Reserving a set of extension crates for a project you’re working on is one example. My other example is reserving a crate you genuinely intend to work on (this one is a little more debatable).</p><h2 id="it-s-about-the-trade-offs">It’s about the Trade-offs</h2><p>With this system in mind, it’s hard to come up with a namespace proposal that doesn’t hurt the current system in some way.</p><p>I’d say the biggest tension is in code-level identities. They become either overlapping by chopping the namespace portion off or much longer by including the namespace portion. The previous points show why overlapping is generally considered a non-starter. And for longer identities, you need to come up with some new way to reference namespaces in code that’s doesn’t break things.</p><p>More to the point though, from what I’ve seen, most people proposing identity schemes propose it so that the ecosystem can support the overlapping crate identities (e.g. multiple http crates). And that’s exactly what the current system avoids doing.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">an on-point quote from CAD97</a> summing up (hopefully fairly accurately) what namespaces mean to the parties involved:</p><blockquote><p>To the crates team, it seems to <em>primarily</em> mean that a project can put multiple packages together under an umbrella, such that you know the packages are for-sure by the project.</p><p>To the people who feel most slighted by the crates team’s approach here, namespaces <em>primarily</em> mean the ability to publish a crate with a desired name even if there’s already a package published that provides a crate with that name, by putting the package into a different namespace such that the names do not clash.</p><p>If the latter party asks about “namespaces” and means the latter, and the team answers and means the former, you can see where the miscommunication enters, especially since the crates team has now communicated here the position that <em>generally</em>, the <code>package.name == lib.name</code> falsehood should not be made more false; i.e., the latter group’s goal is an explicitly non-desired property from the crates team.</p></blockquote><h2 id="where-to-now">Where to Now?</h2><p>There have been other proposals for namespaces that are less about overlapping identity and more about curation and grouping related crates together. There are multiple proposals there, each with their trade-offs. Expect a follow-up post discussing some of those.</p><h2 id="appendix-a-highlights">Appendix A: Highlights</h2><p>There’s a nice set of a dozen or so comments I save as I reviewed past discussions:</p><p>Carol10Cents (of the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/cargo-problems-namespacing/2085/11</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/20</a></li></ul><p>kornel:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/26</a></li></ul><p>sgrif (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/39</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/5</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/7</a></li></ul><p>CAD97:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571/57</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-686823633</a></li></ul><p>withoutboats (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/10</a></li></ul><p>ag_dubs (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/27</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628/28</a></li></ul><p>pietroalbini (on the crates.io team):</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2978#issuecomment-683424791</a></li></ul><p>Random meeting notes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT">https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/All-hands-Crate-grouping-Namespacing-discussion-NEpWAaDdNuUheLpawETYT</a></li></ul><h2 id="appendix-b-previous-discussions">Appendix B: Previous Discussions</h2><p>There have been several attempts at this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/namespacing-on-crates-io/8571</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-domains-as-namespaces/8688</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-packages-as-namespaces/8628</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/scoped-packages-like-in-npm/10223/3</a></li><li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-idea-cratespaces-crates-as-namespace-take-2-or-3/11320</a> (This was mine from last year after reading through the other proposals; my …</li></ul></div></div>

        <div>
          <p>Long time no see!
This time I would like to write about a library I was working about a couple years ago,
a serializers library in Ruby.
I have actually finished it about a year ago and I always wanted to create this blog post
but last year has been super busy for me so never got the chance to present it properly :)</p>



<p>But first I would like to talk about serializers in Ruby from a historical perspective :)</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in 2013-2014</h3>

<p>Back in 2014, when I started working with APIs, go-to library for serializing Ruby
classes was <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">ActiveModelSerializers</a>, the newly published 0.9.x version.
Back then, with this awesome library we were building basic GraphQL-like structures, before
GraphQL was even announced! It was a joy working with a such powerful tool
where the client could specify which fields it needs from a specific resource but also
which relations.
You could inject exactly what you needed when you were actually rendering the serializer
which meant that you could take a union of client’s desired fields/associations,
the default fields/associations (if client’s input was empty), and what client was allowed to access.
The result was a super flexible API.</p>

<p>Apart from AMS, there was <a href="https://github.com/ismasan/oat">Oat</a> a pretty nice little library which supported
out of the box <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a> and <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">JSON:API</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jbuilder</a> which for some
reason felt like Godzilla to me at that point, but to be honest it’s a completely proper way of
building hypermedia APIs in Ruby since you can do a lot of cool stuff with caching.
However the catch is that you can’t create reusable adapters, basically it’s like
Rails views, everything needs to be implemented from scratch.</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in 2015-2016</h3>

<p>Going forward, in 2015, the AMS rewrite had already begun since 2014 for the
0.10.x version. For various reasons, in the company I was working at that time, it was decided
to go with the 0.10.x and of course we completely regretted it. At that point it was 0.10.RC4 that we
were using, just 1 RC release before the 0.10.0. Now you can tell me, “of course
what do you expect? You were using an RC version” and you might be right. Only that the frustration
didn’t come from things that weren’t polished 100%.
I would be fine with that and I was eager to help out.
The frustration came from the fact that the architecture was a completely different beast
from 0.9 and 0.8 versions, everything were different, code and (the sparse) documentation.
And I am saying this because I <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=author%3Avasilakisfil">did try</a> to help out sending pull requests, and the more
I was working with the code, the more frustrated I got.</p>

<p>Here are some things that come to my mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>both 0.8/0.9 and 0.10.x are using the same repo, although they share completely different
API/code, making things extremely confusing from a API developer perspective, but also
very difficult to manage as well from a contributor’s perspective</li>
<li>super complex overall architecture</li>
<li>the gem made JSON:API as first citizen. That’s inflexible to build adapters for different
specs and has affected pretty much everything in the code.
The previous versions were using the AMS API style (mostly json with some very basic patterns). 0.10.x version
also supported that style but the code for that was like a completely different
branch inside the code (not sure if it’s still like that but I guess it is).
I understand that JSON:API is a quite popular spec, but tight the whole generic library to that
spec is a bad design, I think.</li>
<li>too many dependencies (requires ActiveSupport..)</li>
<li>tightly coupled to ActiveRecord (at least at that time, not sure if now has changed..)</li>
<li>caching was implemented in the same library. I really thing that’s a completely different concern..</li>
<li>some parts did not match the Ruby coding style (like include: ‘a,string,of,resources’, default_includes ‘**’)</li>
<li>maintainers were reluctant to merge pull requests, because even in the Github issues was an extreme
confusion of what’s implemented, what’s missing, what bugs exists etc</li>
</ul>

<p>In one word <strong>it was a failure</strong>. Like, imagine the most popular Serializers gem in Ruby,
Rails team <a href="https://medium.com/@joaomdmoura/the-future-of-ams-e5f9047ca7e9">was pushing them</a> to finish in-time before the release of Rails 5 so they can include
it in the same release (although completely different gem, I guess they would make a note about it),
maintainers were struggling to make this happen and of course it didn’t.</p>

<p>Now I should also pause a bit and say that <strong>I have nothing against the commiters/maintainers</strong>.
They definitely <strong>did their best, and the problem wasn’t lying there</strong>.
It’s just that sometimes Open Source projects fail.
And in my experience they fail, when there isn’t a very tight core team that has the same vision,
coding style and are gatekeepers in pull requests, until the library has proved itself.
Then, any new pull request will probably respect the existing code and won’t challenge it.
Merging code will be much easier, at that point.</p>

<p>Instead with AMS, <strong>different people started the rework, different people took over
and did their best to finish it</strong>, and for the whole time, various people were sending pull
requests for various features and bugs, of course to help out, but what happened
was a very complex architecture with no clear design and vision.
Actually it would be a great idea to take some interviews by the project contributors at that time.
I think they will have some insights to contribute regarding to what happened :)</p>

<p>During my frustration with AMS I always wondered: how difficult can it be to
build a feature-complete Ruby Serializers ? Well, it turned out to be a bit more complex
than I initially thought. <strong>Way more complex</strong> :)</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers in  2017-2018</h3>

<p>I guess I wasn’t the one who was a bit frustrated with AMS.
<a href="https://github.com/beauby">beauby</a>, an AMS core member went off and created a JSON:API specific serializers gem,
the <a href="https://github.com/jsonapi-rb">jsonapi-rb</a>.
It follows spec pretty well and should be fine using it.
It’s also dependency free.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a year later (2018) Netflix came over and published <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">their own
JSON:API serializers gem</a> which is extremely fast to be honest.
Like <strong>SUPER FAST</strong>.
Unfortunately it requires ActiveSupport as a dependency (not sure why, earlier releases didn’t)
and that could be a bummer for some applications.
Also it might not be as flexible as AMS or jsonapi-rb (although latest releases have
closed the gap A LOT), but in my experience it’s flexible enough that you will
almost never need to look for something else.</p>

<h3>Ruby serializers today</h3>

<p>Today, if someone asked me which Serializers gem should I use, I would tell him/her
go for the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">fast_jsonapi</a> gem. It’s super fast, it supports a quite popular API
spec and you must have a really good reason to not use it.</p>

<p>Personally, <strong>I am a bit against of having links inside the response</strong>, treating the
client as plain stupid. That’s one of the reasons why I don’t like JSON:API.
I think it’s just too verbose.
(The other reason is the naming: they picked up the 2 most popular words regarding APIs,
<em>JSON</em> and <em>API</em>, glued them together and made the name, feels so much cheating..)
I like to load off some work to the client using introspective
methods. I have talked <a href="https://introspected.rest/">about it</a> some time ago.
But if anyone came and asked me what I would suggest for a brand new API, my
answer would be pretty straightforward: <strong>JSON:API, unless you have good reasons
not to</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s the more experienced API designers that might want to implement something more
versatile and more advanced, tailored to a specific use case.
Or might want to experiment a bit.
For instance, another cool API spec that’s in the same philosophy as JSON:API is
<a href="https://ionspec.org/">Ion</a>.
Not as popular as JSON:API but worth checking it out!
Problem is that when you need to implement something different from JSON:API,
in Ruby you don’t really have much options. Well you have, it’s AMS but it will
be pain in the ass to create a custom serializer from that one.
And it will be painstakingly slow.
And you can’t have more advanced concepts, like forms, relations on collections
etc.
Or you could use <a href="https://github.com/rails/jbuilder">jbuilder</a>, but the problem with jbuilder is that it can’t
have the notion of adapters, hence you always need to build the final result
from scratch. Not fun.</p>

<h3>SimpleAMS: Modern Ruby Serializers</h3>

<p>When I started working on the prototype of SimpleAMS, I set a couple of goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted the library to be super simple, easy to use with injectable API and clean code.
Have you seen <a href="https://github.com/varvet/pundit">pundit</a>? I want a pundit for serializing.</li>
<li>One of the things that I sometimes don’t like in Ruby coding style, is the level of assumptions that the
code makes on behalf of you.
It had been a quite common pattern in Ruby/Rails that lead to many confusion of what
exactly the API is while at the same time such patterns reduce the flexibility.
The code is trying to act smart, but the drawbacks of such smartness overweight the gains.
I feel some basic assumptions which can be overridden at anytime is the ideal.
Embracing clean, explicit code is what I want, so that you can understand what’s happening instantly.</li>
<li>I wanted to create a generic abstraction as a first class citizen. From there
you should be able to implement any serializer needed, but that abstraction should be
powerful enough to cover even the most extreme corner cases.
After all, it’s tough to beat <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/fast_jsonapi">fast_jsonapi</a>, that’s shouldn’t be my goal ;)</li>
<li>I wanted super clean code, no smarty complex meta thingies inside the code.
I also wanted expected behavior on the internals and how it works when someone
started looking in the codebase.
Of course except the <a href="https://github.com/vasilakisfil/SimpleAMS/blob/master/lib/simple_ams/dsl.rb">DSL part</a>, which uses some advanced Ruby metaprogramming concepts,
but that’s necessary if we want it to work with just an <code>include</code>.</li>
<li>Much faster than AMS, it’s well known that AMS is quite slow so that should be easy :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The API</h3>

<p>Before starting on any new project, I like to put my imagination and come up
with a useful API and use cases.
Being in god mode, and leaving all the constraints on the side, you can come up with
some really cool APIs.</p>

<h4>DSL based API</h4>

<p>So how would you use a serializers library in Ruby?
I want to avoid any inheritance in order to use SimpleAMS,
because …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let's face it, It is not easy to choose a freaking PC these days with the deluge of specifications that come with it let alone FPGAs. The question of using FPGAs to solve any computing problem only arises when an extraordinary performance is required. Owing to this fact, FPGAs in their feature specification and build can be extremely specific to the application at hand. This results in an insane number of varieties in terms of the logic structures within the FPGA as well as the interfaces that are provided with the external world. However, this guide aims to guide you in the right direction (which does not mean dumping a list of the hundreds of different options out there) based on your level of experience and requirement.</p>
<p>There are other posts out there that provide large tables with exhaustive lists of FPGA development boards out there and let you (after a year or two of research) make a choice. If that's your thing, I'll attach some links to help you get started.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're already familiar with the various bells and whistles of  FPGAs and are only looking for some good suggestions, you might prefer to <a href="https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide#the-top-contenders"><strong>JUMP TO THE LIST OF SUGGESTIONS</strong></a>.  If not, read on to learn some very important stuff about the FPGA world and how to choose better!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-be-looking-for"><a href="#what-you-should-be-looking-for" aria-label="what you should be looking for permalink"></a>What you should be looking for</h2>
<p>There are already a lot of aspects to an FPGA in general that determine its fit to a particular problem and the ease with which it can be programmed, now add to this the complexity of a feature-rich development board with all sorts of peripherals, interfaces, connectors and memory options you have at hand a humongous task of deciding between hundreds of varieties out there.</p>
<h3 id="soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga"><a href="#soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga" aria-label="soc based board or just an fpga permalink"></a>SOC based board or just an FPGA?</h3>
<p>SOC stands for <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/ic-types/system-on-chip/" target="_blank">System-on-Chip</a> which simply means that various interacting technologies are built onto the same die (/chip). You see SOCs everywhere, on your phones, TVs, and computers. In the context of an FPGA development board, a SOC based system means that the hardware has two components, a sea of programmable logic (the FPGA) and a hard processor core implemented in silicon independent of the programmable FPGA logic. Interfaces are created between the programmable logic and the processing system (in Xilinx lingo) that enable communication between the two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://thedatabus.io/static/zynq7000-ae213195db5b530cc3f5d60785b3b0b1.png" alt="Zynq7000"></p>
<p>If you are an absolute beginner looking for direction, you should definitely choose a SOC based system because of the immense additional learning potential it adds. Having said that, your first few digital design projects should never involve the processor cores or any kind of software programming. For that, you can just ignore the processor logic and dump your design into the programmable region to use it as a normal FPGA. As you progress, you can add much higher levels of complexity to your design by bringing in the processor core to directly read and write data in your configurable hardware. You can also experiment with writing firmware, drivers, the Linux OS, and the higher levels of abstraction thus getting a truly holistic experience of embedded system design. Even the simplest SOC based board will keep you busy for a long time. </p>
<p>These boards can also be of great interest for Software engineers looking to explore into the digital design world since processor + FPGA structures lend themselves very well to paradigms like HLS, Heterogenous computing and partial acceleration of algorithms. Viewing the FPGA logic as an extension of the SOC is something that is going to be very important in the future and is a good investment of your time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, If you are a beginner but are looking only to learn digital design or you wish to buy a board to complement your studies at college where you get to use a particular board in your lab, you can get a lot more basic FPGA resources (LUTs, BRAMs, DSPs) on a Non-SOC based board that has only the FPGA. This way you save money and have a much less complex system at hand that you can comprehend better. The same is true If you plan to implement something specific that takes up an enormous number of resources, you might be better off going for a dev board that has only the FPGA and the required peripherals.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9yutk8/best_100300_fpga_development_board_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this post</a> on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/" target="_blank">r/FPGA</a> user <strong>u/ndbroadbent</strong> has shown the resource usages of several open source projects, this can give you a good idea of how big projects usually are.</p>
<p><strong>An important note for beginners</strong> : <em>Having an SOC board, with all the processor logic around the FPGA can really deviate you from the basic idea of programmable logic and how you're supposed to learn it. I strongly suggest completely disregarding anything to do with the processor for your first few projects and use only the FPGA part of the device. Also note that as of today, any good FPGA engineer will tell you that any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis#:~:text=High%2Dlevel%20synthesis%20(HLS),hardware%20that%20implements%20that%20behavior."><strong>HLS</strong></a> is not good enough to be used in real world projects. This is doubly true for the beginners. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fall into the 'Write code in C++/Python and run it on FPGA' trap. A lot of youtubers seem to be promoting stuff like that for beginners these days which is just sad. If you have the money to spend, the ideal (and more enjoyable) learning strategy would be to use a standalone FPGA board first and upgrade to an SOC later.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="interfaces-and-ios"><a href="#interfaces-and-ios" aria-label="interfaces and ios permalink"></a>Interfaces and IOs:</h3>
<p>FPGAs are excellent tools for working on high-speed interfaces. So you might want to look at the interfaces and IO options a particular development board is providing. This is important because if the board has a particular interface out of the box, the vendor will probably provide the necessary documentation and sample designs for those interfaces. This can save you tons of head-scratching and hair-pulling (trust me that is common in the FPGA world) as a beginner. That's not to say that newer interfaces cannot be added to the board manually but when it comes to High-speed interfaces like Ethernet, HDMI, PCIe, it can be very difficult to add them yourself and expect reliable performance. Low-speed ones like SPI, UART, etc can always be manually added using the GPIOs, so let them not be the dealbreaker for any board.</p>
<p>Some common networking interfaces that you should look for are high-speed interfaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank"><strong>HDMI</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" target="_blank"><strong>VGA</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" target="_blank"><strong>ETHERNET</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank"><strong>PCIe</strong></a>  etc. and low-speed peripherals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface" target="_blank"><strong>SP</strong>I</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank"><strong>CAN</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank"><strong>I2C</strong></a>  etc.</p>
<p>Although not as important for a beginner, another set of interfaces that can be useful are the analog and sensor interfaces like ADCs, DACs, Camera Interface, Audio CODECs, etc. These are very niche features that can make or break a particular project if it depends on data acquisition from the external world.</p>
<p>If you choose to go for a board with not too many peripherals for whatever reason, you might be better off choosing one that has the industry-standard <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/" target="_blank"><strong>PMOD</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card" target="_blank"><strong>FMC</strong></a> connectors installed so that when you do need additional interfaces in the future, they can be added very easily. These standard connectors essentially decouple FPGA carrier boards from the IO engines (which plug-in as daughter cards), enabling you to use the same FPGA boards with a large variety of IO designs without ever having to re-design the board.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="buttons-leds-and-displays"><a href="#buttons-leds-and-displays" aria-label="buttons leds and displays permalink"></a>Buttons, LEDs, and Displays:</h3>
<p>Debugging FPGA designs can be a hard thing. Unlike MCUs where you can place print statements and breakpoints anywhere you want in the code, there is no such equivalent in the FPGA world and that can often lead to great frustration. One workaround is possible, if there are switches and LEDs on your board. They provide an easy way to pull out signals to the real world and give you an indication of the status of some status registers that can help you visualize and debug (like the current state of a state machine or a particular flag in a CPU design). However, this should not be the deciding factor between two boards since it is very easy to add LEDs, buttons, switches, and LCDs using the GPIO connectors without much effort.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="memory-and-resource-count"><a href="#memory-and-resource-count" aria-label="memory and resource count permalink"></a>Memory and Resource Count:</h3>
<p>The Resource Count is another important metric that goes into deciding on an FPGA device. By resource, we mean the number of programmable logic elements available on the board. These can be LUTs (ALMs for Altera), Block Rams, DSPs, and IO blocks. Much more complex and fancier devices like the  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/acap/versal.html" target="_blank"> Versal family</a> from Xilinx can have lots of other stuff like AI, video, and audio cores, etc. It is important to take note of these resource numbers because they determine the biggest project that you can successfully fit onto the FPGA. It is hard to come up with a fixed count for a particular project owing to differences in the underlying CLB architecture from vendor to vendor and family to family.</p>
<p>FPGAs store the configuration(bitstream) data on the SRAM (usually) cells within the FPGA. Since SRAM is a volatile kindof memory, the program is lost each time the board is power-cycled. A PC support is needed to reprogram it again after the power cycle, to prevent this, FLASH (or EEPROM in older boards) based storage is provided onboard by the vendors. Flash is a non-volatile form of storage that holds the bitstream data even without a power supply. Each time the board comes up after a power cycle, the FPGA checks the flash memory for a bitstream and programs itself with it. This is usually given by default in most boards but can be something important to look out for. </p>
<p>The other important form of memory is the external onboard volatile storage which is most commonly provided in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM" target="_blank">DDR SDRAM</a>  This is extremely useful if you are building an application that needs to store data locally for whatever reason. Since the block ram storage within the FPGA fabric is very little and is very precious, having a DDR that can be written to and read from in a reasonable amount of time is very much essential. The more the better!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-174">
	
	<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
		<p>Checked exceptions have always been a controversial feature of the Java language.</p>
<p>Advocates claim they ensure checking &amp; recovery from failures. Detractors say “catch” blocks can almost never recover from an exception, and are a frequent source of mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Java 8 and lambdas are here. Are checked exceptions becoming obsolete in the Java world?<span id="more-174"></span></p>
<h3>The Intent of Checked Exceptions</h3>
<p>In the mid 90’s, James Gosling at Sun came up with a new language.</p>
<p>At the time, C++ programming required every single function return to be checked for error. He decided there had to be a better way, and built the concept of “exceptions” into Java.</p>
<p>The intent of <strong>checked exceptions</strong> was to locally flag, and force developers to handle, possible exceptions. Checked exceptions have to be declared on a method signature, or handled.</p>
<p>This was intended to encourage software reliability &amp; resilience. There was an intent to “recover” from contingencies – predictable outcomes other than success, such as InsufficientFundsException on attempting a payment. There was less clarity, as to what “recovery” actually entailed.</p>
<p><strong>Runtime exceptions</strong>&nbsp;were also included in Java. Since null pointers, data errors, and illegal states/ accesses could occur anywhere in code, these were made subtypes of RuntimeException.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions can be thrown anywhere, without requiring to be declared, and are much more convenient. But would it be correct to use them instead?</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks</h3>
<p>The crucial point here, is that runtime &amp; checked exceptions are functionally equivalent.&nbsp;There is no handling or recovery which checked exceptions can do, that runtime exceptions can’t.</p>
<p>The biggest argument against “checked” exceptions is that most exceptions can’t be fixed. The simple fact is, <strong>we don’t own the code/ subsystem that broke.&nbsp;</strong>We can’t see the implementation, we’re not responsible for it, and can’t fix it.</p>
<p>Particularly problematic were the areas of JDBC (SQLException) and RMI for EJB (RemoteException). Rather than identifying fixable contingencies as per the original “checked exception” concept, these forced pervasive systemic reliability issues, not actually fixable, to be widely declared.</p>
<p>For any method, the possibility of failure includes all sub-methods called by it. Potential failures accumulate up the call tree. Declaring these on method signatures no longer offers a specific &amp; local highlight for the developer to watch for – declared exceptions spread throughout the call tree.</p>
<p>Most EJB developers have experienced this – declared exceptions become&nbsp;required on methods through the tier,&nbsp;or entire codebase. Calling a method with different&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;requires dozens of methods to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Many developers were told to catch low-level exceptions, and rethrow them again as higher (application-level) checked exceptions. This required vast numbers – 2000 per project, upwards – of non-functional “catch-throw” blocks.</p>
<p>Swallowing exceptions, concealing the cause, double logging, and returning ‘null’/ uninitialized data all became common. Most projects could count 600+ mis-coded or outright errors.</p>
<p>Eventually, developers rebelled against the vast numbers of “catch” blocks, and the source of error these had become.</p>
<h3>Checked Exceptions – incompatible with Functional Coding</h3>
<p>And then we get to Java 8, with its new <i><b>functional programming&nbsp;</b></i>features – such as lambdas, Streams, and function composition.</p>
<p>These features are built on generics – parameter &amp; return types are genericized, so that iteration &amp; stream operations ( <code>forEach</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>) can be written which perform a common operation, regardless of item type.</p>
<p>Unlike data types, however, declared exceptions can’t be genericized.</p>
<p>There is no possibility in Java to provide a stream operation (like, for example, &nbsp;<code>Stream.map</code>) which takes a lambda declaring some checked exception, &amp; transparently passes that same checked exception to surrounding code.</p>
<p>This has always been a major points against checked exceptions – all intervening code, between a throw and the receiving “catch” block, is forced to be aware of exceptions.</p>
<p>The workaround, of “wrapping” it in a RuntimeException, conceals the original type of the exception – rendering the exception-specific “catch” blocks envisaged in the original concept useless.</p>
<p>Finally we can capture Java’s new philosophy in a nutshell, by noting that none of the new “functional interfaces” in Java 8 declare checked exceptions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Exceptions in Java provided major benefits in reliability &amp; error-handling over earlier languages.&nbsp;Java enabled reliable server &amp; business software, in a way C/ C++ never could.</p>
<p>Checked exceptions were,&nbsp;in their original form, an attempt&nbsp;to handle&nbsp;<i>contingencies</i>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;<i>failures</i>.&nbsp;The laudable goal was to highlight specific predictable points (unable to connect,&nbsp;file not found,&nbsp;etc) &amp; ensure developers handled these.</p>
<p>What was never included in the original concept, was to force a vast range of systemic &amp;&nbsp;unrecoverable failures to be declared. These <em>failures</em>&nbsp;were never correct to be&nbsp;declared as checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Failures are generally possible in code, and EJB, web &amp; Swing/AWT containers already cater for this by providing an outermost “failed request” exception-handler. The most basic correct strategy is to rollback the transaction &amp; return an error.</p>
<p>Runtime exceptions allow any exception-handling possible with checked exceptions, but avoid restrictive coding restraints. This simplifies coding &amp; makes it easier to follow best practice of&nbsp;<a href="http://wikijava.org/wiki/10_best_practices_with_Exceptions#Throw_early_catch_late" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://wikijava.org']);">throw early, catch late</a>&nbsp;where exceptions are handled at the outermost/ highest possible level.</p>
<p>Leading Java frameworks and influences have now definitively moved&nbsp;away from checked exceptions. Spring, Hibernate and modern Java frameworks/&nbsp;vendors&nbsp;use only runtime exceptions, and this convenience is a major factor in their popularity.</p>
<p>Personalities such Josh Bloch (Java&nbsp;Collections framework), Rod Johnson, Anders Hejlsberg (father of&nbsp;C#), Gavin King&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn&nbsp;(JodaTime)&nbsp;have all come out against checked exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, in&nbsp;Java 8,&nbsp;lambdas are&nbsp;the&nbsp;fundamental step forward.&nbsp;These language features&nbsp;abstract the “flow of control” from functional operations within. As we’ve seen, this makes checked exceptions &amp; the requirement to “declare or handle immediately” obsolete.</p>
<p>For developers, it is always important to pay attention to reliability &amp; diagnose likely points of failure (contingencies) such as file open, database connection, etc. If we provide good error messages at this points, we will have&nbsp;created&nbsp;self-diagnosing software – a pinnacle of engineering achievement.</p>
<p>But we should do this with unchecked exceptions, and if we have to rethrow, should always use RuntimeException or an app-specific subclass.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Stephen Colebourn says, if your projects&nbsp;are&nbsp;still using or advocating checked exceptions, your skills are 5-10 years out date.&nbsp;Java&nbsp;has moved&nbsp;on.</p>
<p><strong>How are you dealing with exceptions &amp; reliability? Add your thoughts now.</strong></p>

<p>I was first diagnosed with depression when I was working on a startup in 2007. I went to the doctor, told him I was feeling mild flu symptoms for a couple of months, he asked me a few questions, determined that I had depression, gave my some SSRIs, and sent me home.</p>



<p>It worked for a while, but then 2008 happened, our startup collapsed, the stakes got higher and the depression came back. The doc recommended I up the dosage, but I could see this would eventually lead me to a straitjacket.</p>



<p>Over the years I’ve tried different meds, various forms of therapy, studied and actively practiced life coaching, got married, had kids, moved to another country and changed everything I could think of about my life. Unfortunately the dark bouts of depression remained.</p>



<p>About four years ago I stumbled on a book called Highly Sensitive Person that absolutely blew my mind. I realized I had very intense emotions that I was culturally programmed to repress, which caused my psyche to overload and go into full apathy mode also known as clinical depression.</p>



<p>I’ve been on a path to figure out how to process my emotions without repressing them and combined my personal experience with several non-mainstream techniques to build Wuju. It’s an online app that can help you tap into your hidden emotions and release them so they no longer influence your behaviour or cause depressive symptoms.</p>



<p>I’ve used it in the last 18 months to deal with parenting two kids, surviving infidelity, losing my job, starting a business, and covid anxiety. My longest bouts of depression now last a day at most and even that doesn’t happen too often.</p>



<p>You can try it too: <a href="https://beta.wuju.app/">beta.wuju.app</a></p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-09-11</p>
        
<p>I'm always a bit flabbergasted when I see how people test their code (especially with unit tests). Often I can't figure out a cohesive set of rules based on which the tests are written.</p>
<p>Testing seems to work from a pragmatic perspective, we have evidence it works, but different people define "testing" in different ways. I'm awfully afraid that what some people refer to as "testing" is completely unrelated to that unrigorous but pragmatic practice that saves us from production bugs.</p>
<h2>I - A contrived example</h2>
<p>To showcase my arbitrary formalism as it relates to testing, I think it's worthwhile to look at some cases:</p>
<h4>1)</h4>
<pre><code># Testing a multiplication function
func multiply(int a, int b) -&gt; int

func test_1():
  assert 2*5 == multiply(2,5)
  assert 10*12 == multiply(12,10)

func test_2():
  assert 10 == multiply(2,5)
  assert 120 == multiply(12,10)

func test_3():
  assert type(multiply(2,5)) == int
  assert type(multiply) == func(int,int)-&gt;int
</code></pre>
<h4>2)</h4>
<pre><code># Testing an image classification algorithm
func classify(arr[int] image) -&gt; str

func test_1():
  assert img_classification_nn(to_arr('cat.jpg')) == classify(to_arr('cat.jpg'))
  assert img_classification_nn(to_arr('dog.jpg')) == classify(to_arr('dog.jpg'))

func test_2():
  assert 'cat' == classify(to_arr('cat.jpg'))
  assert 'dog' == classify(to_arr('dog.jpg'))

func test_3():
  possible_targets = ['cat','cheta','tiger','dog','wolf','coyote','other']
  assert classify(to_arr('rand_img_1.jpg')) in possible_targets
  assert classify(to_arr('rand_img_2.jpg')) in possible_targets
</code></pre>
<p>For both examples, <code>test_1</code> obviously makes no sense. You're testing the functionality of a function using another function that does the same thing. If the function used to assert correct functionality is better (i.e. if <code>*</code> is better than <code>multiply</code> or <code>img_classification_nn</code> is better than <code>classify</code>), than one should simply use that function instead. If they are equally flawed, then the tests are redundant.</p>
<p>These kinds of tests are a theatrical performance to build up an illusion of quality. Usually spotted in enterprise-grade codebases and teams that harp on about TDD a lot, I'll classify these as <strong>redundant checks</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, <code>test_2</code> is more interesting, it's comparing the result of a function with what a human would expect the result of that function to be. Here I would argue the test makes sense for the <code>classify</code> function but not for the <code>multiply</code> function.</p>
<p>Computers are good at multiplying, humans are horrible at it. So testing this function against an arbitrary number of human answers is much more likely to reveal flaws with the human's answer rather than the computer's. Since the function is very simple, time would probably better spent reviewing the actual code to make sure it's error-free.</p>
<p>On the other hand, computers aren't very good at classifying images (though they are getting there), but humans are spot on. So using a human's answers to validate a vision algorithm makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>We'll call these types of tests <strong>human validations</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we get to <code>test_3</code>, which superficially seems less flawed than the other two. It's more of a sanity check than a test, we aren't checking the actual return value of the function in a given case, we are instead checking a higher-level behavior.</p>
<p>These tests are much more common in the codebases of dynamic languages, and for good reason. In our first example, we are just validating the signature of a function, something a compiler will implicitly do for us in any statically typed language.</p>
<p>In the second example, we are instead working around a limitation of our type system. We are checking if the result of our function (a string) is contained within 7 different values (the possible things our function should classify images as), which we could test implicitly by using a language that supports <code>enum</code> types and writing <code>classify</code> such that it returns an enum of those 7 classes.</p>
<p>Basically, these kinds of tests can be useful, but they are the kind of things a compiler can handle automatically when they are present they usually indicate a mistake in the language the programmer is using for the project. We'll call these <strong>compiler rules</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Obviously, this system is fairly arbitrary, it's just a conclusion I reached after looking at various codebases and talking with various people about their tests, but I find that it works quite well.</p>
<p>To re-iterate, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>redundant checks</li>
<li>human validation</li>
<li>compiler rules</li>
</ul>
<h2>II - Compiler rules</h2>
<p>Compiler rules are great, but it's a bad sign when they leak into your testing.</p>
<p>Some amount of compiler rules leaking into testing can't be helped. Until the advent of Rust and/or well-performing libraries for safe multi-threading, testing thread safety should have been a requirement in many codebases. Similarly, before modern type system and allocation techniques, one ought to assume various now-pointless memory checks might have fared well within a codebase (and, I assume, still do on some embedded devices).</p>
<p>Even more, switching to more modern languages and compilers is often a task much harder than just writing some tests, but I think these tests should be viewed as a cautionary sign against the language currently used. If they only cover a small but critical percentage of the codebase, everything is fine, if they cover most of it, it's an indicator of using the wrong compile-time tooling.</p>
<p>The one difficult thing about these tests might be spotting them, an inexperienced team might be writing loads of these tests without realizing there are better alternatives to the compile-time toolchain they are using which would replace the need for them.</p>
<h2>III - Redundant checks</h2>
<p>Redundant checks are often pointless busywork, but they can serve a valuable role in some cases.</p>
<p>The two main scenarios that come to mind are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Given two versions of the same function, one well-proven and one "experimental", where the "experimental" function has some benefits in terms of performance or generalizability, it seems reasonable to test the "experimental" function using the well-proven approach. Still, the overhead here is so severe I find it difficult to think of a real-world example where this applies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given two versions of the same function, one in a "new" codebase and one an "old" codebase, it makes sense to test the "new" version with the "old" version. In this sense, going back to compiler rules, redundant checks can be useful in the process of refactoring, especially for major changes like changing the language or the core framework upon which the project is built. However, this seems useful only as a "temporary" measure rather than a permanent fixture of a project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, I'd wager that most tests falling in this category, as mentioned before, are there only as "filler" and indicative of a much bigger underlying problem of a team that engages in busywork. If I ever accepted such a test, I would require plenty of complimentary comments to explain why they exist and when they can be removed.</p>
<h2>IV - Human validation</h2>
<p>Human validation is the "sanest" type of testing one can perform, it can be replaced by good practices or good languages. The problem with human validation comes from the fact that in some cases human intelligence can't solve the problems the software is designed to solve or can't cover all the edge cases the software will encounter.</p>
<p>Take for example banking software. It's fairly easy to imagine what should happen with a piece of banking software that provided dozens of customers, hundreds of transactions, and a few regulatory restrictions. All the logic there can be written down into tests that validate our software. However, the software itself must scale to millions of customers, trillions of transactions, and thousands of regulatory restrictions. Something a human mind can't comprehend coherently in order to write the tests.</p>
<p>Still, banking software is an easy example, because the various components might be test-able and their limited logic might be fully comprehensible by a human, even accounting for all the edge cases. This is because the inputs to the software are very well defined, there are only so many things one can do with a banking API, a finite space which a human mind can explore exhaustively when properly broken down.</p>
<p>One real problem arises when we have software with a very broad and/or poorly define input and/or outputs spaces. A few examples of these would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrappers that distill information from a broad range of websites (e.g. the ones used by a search engine)</li>
<li>Machine learning algorithms meant to work on a broad range of data (e.g. a decision tree or a gradient boosting classifier implementation in a library like sklearn)</li>
<li>Any software that has to work well with user-provided code extensions (e.g. think a video game-like Skyrim that has to support mods)</li>
<li>Simulation software (e.g. physics simulations)</li>
<li>Creative software (e.g. multimedia editing &amp; creation, game engines)</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
</ul>
<p>One can separate these into components with input-output spaces that can be easily comprehended by the human mind, but some components that suffer from the above problems are bound to remain. It also introduces the problem of writing code separation in such a way that components can be easily tested, rather than with refactoring, extension, speed, or readability as the main concern.</p>
<h2>V - Human validation and cost</h2>
<p>Assuming that we've designed our software such that it has many human-comprehensible components, the issue of cost remains. Human-comprehensible is a vague term, there are many things which, given enough time, a person could write exhaustive tests for, but in practice, this often takes more time than we can allocate. Furthermore, in certain situations, even in the limited input&amp;output space scenario, it might still be easier to write the "generative" logic (the one that maps inputs to outputs) than to come up with mappings ourselves.</p>
<p>In certain cases, exhaustive validation can be done, but it can be …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Over the years I've used every operating system. Sometimes all at once. Recently I've taken to using Linux as my primary desktop operating system. Everything I need runs natively on Linux and because I have full control over my environment I never have down time due to forced updates. This is my desktop after all so I'm really switching from Windows where the Control key modifier paradigm is more or less the same as Linux. Still I didn't want to compromise on anything with this new configuration and there was one thing missing from my Macbook that I really wanted.</p>
<p>Of course what I'm talking about is the Command key or more colloquially known simply as the Apple Key and all the shortcuts and hot keys built into macOS that make it such a joy to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/70" width="200"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Linux lets you change whatever you want."</em></p>
<p>Is a common thing that people say to bring up a positive aspect of GNU/Linux. Is this actually true though? Take for example my issue at hand: Changing copy/paste hotkeys for all programs. In truth, some tasks are so big in their scope few users would ever be capable of accomplishing them. At least not without a lot of contextual knowledge.</p>
<p>Getting macOS style hotkeys is actually an extremely difficult task in Linux. Especially when you want to avoid faking it by binding some keys to other keys on a per application basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's the question of why do it at all?</p>
<p><span><span>The truth is I just got tired of </span></span><span><span>accidentally sending SIGINTs when switching to terminal and then accidentally triggering the wrong thing when switching out of terminal. I've just gotten so used to not having to context switch my brain in macOS between programs. It's one of the things that truly makes my Macbook Pro more pleasant to use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://technex.us/media/73"></span></span></p>
<p>So that's my first reason. Muscle memory.</p>
<p>My second reason is simply that Command/Meta is directly next to the space bar and I just like having a shorter stretching span for my hand.</p>

<h3>Making it work</h3>
<p>For the most part GUI applications written for Linux tend to make a lot of assumptions about what hotkeys can and should be in a very opinionated way. Some types of programs require full customization (like code editors) while others like browsers tend to force certain hotkeys. Desktop managers do provide their own hotkey bindings. For example most KDE based applications will use your settings from KDE's "System Settings" to set hotkeys. Meanwhile in Gnome you can use dbind to set your keybinds.</p>
<p>Of course Cut/Copy/Paste is not enough. It would actually be quite jarring to use CTRL+T for opening a new tab immediately after using Command+V to paste something. Indeed if you go down this path you'll end up having to redefine your hotkeys for well..... everything. It is unfortunate as well that applications these days are extremely hostile to user settings.</p>
<p>Despite the hurdles in front of me I decided to try to make it work.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was swap Left Alt and Left Meta on my keyboard. This was actually pretty easy to do with keyboard mapping configs with the KDE GUI simply known as "System Settings". This was simply to make my normal windows keyboard place the buttons in the positions a real mac keyboard would have. None of this is necessary if you have a real Apple layout keyboard. This setting is only active while in my X session so any alternative TTYs would revert back to my stock layout. If I had a real Apple layout keyboard though this is not necessary at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/71"></p>
<p>This setting is saved to the text file <code>~/.config/kxkbrc.</code></p>
<pre><code>$ cat kxkbrc 
[Layout]
DisplayNames=
LayoutList=us
LayoutLoopCount=-1
Model=pc101
Options=altwin:swap_lalt_lwin
ResetOldOptions=true
ShowFlag=false
ShowLabel=true
ShowLayoutIndicator=true
ShowSingle=false
SwitchMode=Global
Use=true
</code></pre>
<p>Now with this setting I am able to fake the same key mapping as a real macOS&nbsp;keyboard would have in my desktop session. So far so good. Now I manually changed all my hotkeys in my code editors, terminal applications, and even in the System Settings app I just mentioned to set global hot keys for all KDE applications. This took some time but was very straight forward for the most part.</p>
<p><img src="https://technex.us/media/72"></p>
<p>I went above and beyond even changing my shortcuts for things like Select All.</p>
<p>While this worked for KDE applications I had to also make this change for GTK+ based programs as well. Luckily this would also cover Chrome, Discord, Elements, and a number of other Electron based programs that I use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I was lucky that VSCode let me change everything but it was very annoying have to redo all the system based hotkeys like Set cursor to start of the line (in macOS this is Meta+Left Arrow) for each and every place I wanted to use it.</p>
<p>Some websites also use Meta+C for example in Github hitting Meta+C will actually take focus and bring you to the Add Comment UI when in a thread so sometimes on Github.com even with Firefox set to use Meta+C to copy something I am not actually able to use my hotkey because the website overrides it.</p>
<p>With GTK I ended up editing <code>`</code><span><code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`</code> </span><span>and setting these hotkeys.</span></p>
<pre><code>@binding-set gtk-super-cut-copy-paste
{
        bind "&lt;super&gt;x" { "cut-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;c" { "copy-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;v" { "paste-clipboard" () };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;a" { "select-all" (1) };
        bind "&lt;super&gt;z" { "undo" () };
}

* {
        -gtk-key-bindings: gtk-super-cut-copy-paste
}
</code></pre>
<p>I might add more but for now this got me to where I wanted with most GTK+ applications. Note that if you plan to run any of programs designed to run as root that use GTK+ such as GParted you should also link or copy this config file to the root account home directory as well.</p>
<p>So in the end it is possible. I was able to achieve what I wanted with all but one program. But it was a huge pain. It's really difficult to figure out what settings do what in a Linux environment even when there is documentation. It's typical for documentation to exist for say GTK+ 2.0 and GTK+ 3.0 but there is no over arching best practice guide for what one should do when they want to cover all programs in an environment.</p>


<h3>It Doesn't Have to Be This Way</h3>
<p>The Linux ecosystem can and should do better. The ability to do whatever you want is a double edged sword where even though you can in theory change things, in practice however, sometimes changing things is so onerous that staying sane in the process is a task in itself.</p>
<p>So please if you are a Linux user space developer check the GTK+ 2.0 (<code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code>), GTK+ 3.0 (<code>~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css</code>) and KDE global shortcut configs (<code>~/.config/kdeglobals</code>) when you probe for the environment during startup so that people can choose their own hotkeys for their desktop environment or simply use the C libraries of each and use the hotkeys present.</p>
<p>Better yet, if you are a developer that already supports various input methods for macOS, Linux, and Windows you can simply provide a toggle for users.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to Linux Desktop environments to agree to a standard config file for hotkeys allowing users to bind keys as they see fit rather than lurching from one weird keybinding config to the next with no centralization to speak off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Preface: There is very little in this blog post that is interesting from a technical perspective. The discovered vulnerability is incredibly basic but fairly high risk. Due to the nature of the application, and the fallout from our disclosure attempt, we wanted to write up our findings. The TL;DR is that giggle has been exposing user’s phone numbers, private images and location to the world.</p>

<p>Normally we wouldn’t post a vulnerability like this so soon after discovering it but the owner of the app refuses to listen to us and continuously claims no vulnerability exists. We tried to get in contact with her via a third party (after we had been blocked) to let her read this post before publishing it but, again, she showed no interest.</p>

<p>(edit: We wrote but didn’t publish this article before the vulnerability was fixed. Giggle has told us it has now been fixed so we feel comfortable releasing these details.)</p>

<p>(edit2: Sall is threating us with legal action.)</p>

<p>(edit3: We’ve had some questions about the phrasing in the first public tweet. We standby our words. Not knowing how this would play out, we wanted to make it clear that we didn’t support the app or the founder, but wanted to report the issue. Companies can be unpredictable when reporting vulnerabilities and we wanted to avoid a situation where they would be publicly praising us or even mentioning us on their website etc.)</p>

<p>(edit4: An apology from Giggle has been made and no futher legal action will be taken)</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="what-is-giggle">What is Giggle?</h3>

<p>This week I set up an account on an app called giggle. You see, last month I had been diagnosed with premature menopause I and wanted to find a safe space in a woman centric environment. Somewhere I could talk openly about this experience and maybe get some support, but also find some light hearted way to socialise online.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image1.jpeg.resize.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Without much investigation I found giggle, which seemed to check all the boxes. A free app, promoting safe and secure social networking. Giggle promised a refuge from misogyny and sexism where I could find support and community.</p>

<p>There were a few red flags, such as an excessive use of pink and word “females”, but I decided to give it a go.</p>

<p>At this point the red flags became a little more crimson. Firstly, I was asked to submit my phone number so that a verification code could be sent to my mobile. Then I was asked to allow the app to access my camera so that a selfie of me could be submitted to verify I was female. This verification, apparently, is done using AI. From previous work done on this, we know this can often be notorious for mischaracterising and therefore excluding certain racial groups, some trans women and some masculine looking women.</p>

<p>The app assured me that my verification picture would not be stored so not to worry about what I looked like, so my gargoylesq visage was submitted (I’ll get to the later) and I was duly approved to enter the app.</p>

<p>I went to set up my profile to see what information was publicly available about me, even if only in the app, to find there wasn’t one and I had to set up multiple profiles or ‘giggles’ to start a tinder like experience on each specific subject I was interested in (I chose menopause, body image, hiking and wine tasting), that range from socialising and hobbies to more high risk areas such as abuse and sex work.</p>

<p>As I was curious how secure my data was, and as we are currently working on improvements to <a href="https://rex.digitalinterruption.com/">REX</a> (and thought they’d maybe like a <a href="https://www.digitalinterruption.com/100-free-rex-licences">free license</a>), we decided to dig a little deeper.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-account-details">Viewing Account Details</h3>

<p>Using BurpSuite and a fresh install of the app, we intercepted the network traffic and found a few interesting things that we decided not to look at further as we didn’t have permission to do a full analysis. During the registration process, as mentioned, users are required to verify a phone number and selfie. We submitted a selfie that wouldn’t pass and, unsurprisingly, couldn’t gain access to giggle.</p>

<p>Looking at the network requests revealed that although the account was in an unvalidated state, we still had a valid auth token (it turns out this is hardcoded into the application) allowing us to make requests to the API. Again, we didn’t perform a full analysis although we suspect issues could exist here. What we did look at was the UserList endpoint. This contained a filter parameter that contained my phone number, an operator (in this case “equals”) and a field (“mobile”). Presumably, this is how a user’s account details are fetched from the API.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image2.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, the obvious question is what would happen if we changed this filter parameter to be another phone number, changed the query to filter on another parameter such as user ID or user’s name or even would it remove the filter altogether, allowing us to view all accounts?</p>

<p>First, we decided to change the filter query so it would filter based on the GUID of the original account which we received during our initial analysis. This brought back the original account details which included the user’s phone number, age (which was set to hidden) and a latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>Request:</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image3.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Response:</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image4.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Having the phone number is bad enough, but we checked the returned latitude and longitude using Google Maps. Of course, this brought us to the very house I created the account in.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image5.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This means an attacker that is completely unverified to the application can view the address and phone number of all users if they have the account ID. That is pretty bad in our opinion.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to be able to download the same details without knowing the account ID. Looking at the filter parameter, it’s clear to see there would be many ways to do this. We could remove the filter completely although that would reveal other accounts to us which we were trying to avoid seeing or we could change the query to show all accounts not matching a phone number. As a proof of concept, we decided to change the operator field from “equals” to “contains” and truncated the GUID. As this returned the same data, it should be obvious to see how the query could be trivially modified to expose all registered accounts with no prerequisite account knowledge.</p>

<p>Request:</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image6.png.resize.png" alt="Burp Web Request"></p>

<h3 id="selfies">Selfies!</h3>

<p>What about the supposed private picture that is used to verify accounts? They claim not to store? Behold my gargoylesq visage!</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image7.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we look at the URL of the verification image (which we recovered by viewing network traffic in BurpSuite), we can see that the only thing that is required is the user GUID. As we can view the user GUID for every account (e.g. our test account) we can easily download the associated verification selfie. Although this is not terrible on it’s own, giggle do promise that this isn’t shared or published, and, given that it is available data stored along side my mobile number and geographical coordinates, with this information an attacker would know my address, my personal mobile number and what I look like.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image8.jpeg.resize.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is where we get to the really scary bit. Giggle has sections encouraging women to find support on abortion, abuse, addiction and relationships among other categories. The amount of available data means that with a phone number or name, an abusive partner would potentially be able to find the location of an abused woman and confirm her identity with the verification picture. There is also a section for sex workers, who, understandably would expect any app enabling them to advertise their work to have adequate privacy and security controls. Even if a user deletes their account, that data appears to still be saved by giggle.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image13.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="account-deletion">Account Deletion</h3>

<p>The final thing we looked at is whether a deleted account is actually deleted. We deleted the original account using the “Delete Account” button and tried to view the associated account details.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image9.jpeg.resize.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image10.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, they are still present and only set to Disabled meaning they are still stored by the system. Maybe accounts are deleted periodically. We would normally at this point reach out to the vendor and ask for clarification. This leads us to the next part of the story…</p>

<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3>

<p>We wanted to let giggle know that this vuln existed and ask for some further details, not in the small part because it is so easy to exploit. In the midst of this we had done some digging on the origins of the app and found that the founder had a very public anti-trans agenda. However, much as this sickens us, our job is to protect users so we direct messaged giggle through twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image11.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Having had no response, we decided to send them a tweet asking them to check their DMs with their founder cc’d in, but with a caveat that we do not share or endorse her anti-trans views.</p>

<p><img src="https://research.digitalinterruption.com/assets/img/2020-09-10-giggle-laughable-security/image12.png.resize.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That’s when we were dragged into a full on TERF War.</p>

<p>Our public tweet had no engagement at all until Sall, the giggle founder, decided to share a screenshot of it with her followers. We have since been subject to a tirade of abuse. None of it about the security of the app. Interested parties are free to view our twitter and find the hundreds and hundreds of tweets in response to trying to disclose this vulnerability but we decided not to copy that into this post.</p>

<p>Our founders have reached out to giggle and Sall and have been blocked following every attempt at contact. Our three year incorporated company has been accused of being a creepy bloke who runs private WhatsApp groups full of naked women, a front for the alt-left, making up the vuln to discredit Sall and her company and hypocrites for wanting to protect the data of users despite the apps founder having view that counter our own.</p>

<p>Our company and I (a woman) have been accused of being a man, and therefore a misogynist multiple times. We have been told that as men (60% of Digital Interruption are women), we should not have a say on the safety of women and their personal data.</p>

<p>Sadly, denial is not uncommon when trying to disclose. We are used to being ignored and even getting some pushback, but ultimately we feel it is our responsibility to persist and ensure the …</p></section></div>

        <div>
          <p>I was incredibly lucky to spend 5 amazing years at Heroku. By the end of my time, I was operating in a Staff capacity, although I’m honestly completely unclear which titles at Salesforce actually map to Staff.</p>

<p>Because titles are unclear and because my role was a little amorphous, I chose not to submit a story to Will Lethain’s <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/">great collection</a> at StaffEng.com. That being said, I added a few questions to his questionnaire that I hadn’t seen answered elsewhere, so I figured I’d post this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tell us a little about your current role: where do you work, your title and generally the sort of work do you and your team do.</em></strong></p>

<p>Until recently, I was a Principal engineer at Salesforce, working for their Heroku product. I joined almost five years ago, working on the Heroku Add-ons product, and then transferred to the Heroku API team. For the last year and a half, I worked on the API team for the Salesforce Functions product, which runs on top of Heroku infrastructure.</p>

<p>The API team is at the center of defining how the Salesforce Functions product will work, so there are a lot of different tasks our team does. First and foremost, we write the code to store the state that the customer <em>intends</em> their infrastructure to converge to and then push that down into the infrastructure layer. If you’re interacting with Salesforce Functions, you’re going through our code. We also do a lot of reconciling what the infrastructure can do with the hopes and dreams of product. I did a balance of work, but more towards the “hopes and dreams” side of things.</p>

<p><strong><em>What does a “normal” Staff-plus engineer do at your company? Does your role look that way or does it differ?</em></strong></p>

<p>There is really no “normal” Staff engineer at Salesforce. I usually talk about four different approaches I see in the company, some of which line up with <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes">Will’s archetypes</a> and some which don’t. A lot of folks are a mix of these and rotate through them over a long career at the company.</p>

<p><em>Team(s) Lead/Right Hand</em></p>

<p>You are the primary technical point of contact for 10-20 engineers, across one or more teams. You are typically reporting to a manager of managers. Responsibilities vary based on individuals’ strengths and the strengths of their manager, but there are some common things you <em>must</em> do. If you’re not making your delivery timelines and this is a surprise to your organization, you and your manager have a problem. If product has a dream and no one knows what it would take to build it (time, resources, architecture), you have a problem. If you can’t answer “Why are we building this in this way?” then you have a problem.</p>

<p><em>Product Architect</em></p>

<p>If it’s on TechCrunch or promoted at our corporate conferences, there is an Architect for it. If the project (40+ engineers) fails to be a success, you share responsibility along with the (typically) VP+ engineering manager and Product owner. If you have any type of personal presence, you will be put on a stage and in front of customers. This is the level where you’re helping advocate with your VP for major initiatives to go after certain markets. If we made the wrong bet, some blame is with product, but it’s also on you, and the manager probably won’t look great.</p>

<p><em>Deep Diver</em></p>

<p>You have a lot of deep technical expertise on a particular component or system. You tend to stay on a single team or a single area of the organization. If you work in our legacy codebases, which are the core of our profitability, you are basically unfireable because you know so much. You may write code for some of the gnarliest problems of the legacy system you’re being kept around for, but you’ll often find yourself spending more time interfacing with other teams to explain why your system can’t do what they want and how we can work around it to deliver on a reasonable timeline. You will work closely with your Team Lead on a daily/weekly basis and occasionally have your entire day/week blown up because the Product Architect has identified a need for your expertise and all of a sudden you’re being trotted out to present to some team you’ve never heard of.</p>

<p><em>The Management</em></p>

<p>There are two variants. First, you’re pendulum’ing over to a line manager role, but since your IC title is the same grade as Director or VP, making you a manager would result in a massive pay cut. You’re likely managing a smaller team, given Salesforce targets 12-15 reports. In the second variant, you’re roughly an extension of a VP+ leader. Maybe you’re working on how we keep our many thousands of engineers communicating well. Maybe you’re advising an SVP on where to make technical investments - does our company really have enough of a competitive advantage to go after that market? Sure, the SVP/C-suite person is being told by Product that if you only give us $100 million we can do a ton. Is that true? Hey, we just bought a multi-billion dollar business (or we’re about to): Can you figure out what we should do with them? Many, including Will, call this fire-fighting, but that’s too narrow a view of how these roles really deliver value to large companies: it’s fast-paced opportunity scouting and truth-telling. That being said, you’ll most likely be looking for opportunities and the real truth within the more challenged parts of the business, so I see the fire-fighting analogy.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you define success in your role?</em></strong></p>

<p>First and foremost, I am successful if the folks I work with understand how business decisions tie into their day-to-day work.</p>

<p>At a minimum, this involves a fair amount of understanding why we’re being asked to build something, running ahead of the team to make sure product plans are in place for us, working across teams to come up with an achievable plan and then championing IC concerns as they crop up.</p>

<p>But it also means pushing forward discussions about what kinds of risk are worth taking on in our code at the moment. Is now the right time to commit to this abstraction? Is now the time to address a performance issue with a re-architecture? We’re moving quickly, but also seeing a lot of incidents - what kinds of testing should we invest in?</p>

<p>Success looks like seeing conversations about timeline and priorities between ICs start from a shared background. Success looks like having no major blow ups about “How could you suggest we ship this hack?” Instead, folks can talk about technical choices through a business lens: “I know we’re currently low on staff compared to our product ambitions, but is this the right place to simplify?” Success looks like a team with a shared goal for the quality and resiliency of code that we’re writing. Success also looks like other ICs feeling confident in advocating for changes, since they see our team making technical decisions with a consistent goal in mind. When I talk with ICs in 1:1s, there should be no “I’m not sure why I’m doing X” when it comes to code, infrastructure and incidents.</p>

<p>Next, I am successful when my management chain clearly understanding the particular risks we’re taking on. All of the architectural decisions a team makes will be wrong, eventually. Whether technology changes, our customer base changes or the product itself changes, it’s only a matter of time before we regret those big choices. The key is understanding what bets we’re making and how long we think before we’ll need to revisit them.</p>

<p>Architecture in a large enterprise is a lot about risk management. A large org has a lot of existing momentum in the market and naturally becomes more cautious. I only have a few places where I can advocate for higher-risk bets and those bets are going to be far lower risk than at a start up. While I need to embrace the fact that our decisions will be wrong, I need to be able to speak to the ways in which we will likely be wrong, when we’ll know and what our mitigation strategy will be.</p>

<p>Third, I am successful if I’m saying the right “No”s to my manager. If the ICs that report to my manager end up feeling like “I told you so” or “We knew this was a bad idea” and that wasn’t surfaced for a discussion, that’s on me. As a Staff engineer, I have the responsibility to course correct my manager when we’re over-committed or committed to the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Finally, I’m successful if my organization has a healthy engineering culture. No one person owns culture, but that doesn’t mean we all don’t equally share the burden of building a world-class engineering organization.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you spend your time day-to-day?</em></strong></p>

<p>While I do write code from time-to-time, it’s only after I’ve delivered on my obligations on these four functions.</p>

<p><em>Information gathering</em> - In order to help my team understand the context within which we’re building a thing, I need a lot of information. I almost unfailingly start my day with a list of longer emails and docs of all varieties to digest. I also spend a fair amount of time in cross-org chats with assorted managers &amp; ICs, whose purpose is a combination of information gathering and the coaching I mention below.</p>

<p><em>Planning</em> - Knowing a bunch of stuff isn’t helpful unless we actually do something with it, so I also spend a lot of time in planning activities. This is a lot of writing docs and running meetings. Planning activities are usually very collaborative – I rarely know the most on any one thing, but I can knit them all together into a plan.</p>

<p><em>Context sharing</em> - Knowing what we want to do isn’t helpful unless a lot of people understand the plan, so the final category of work that’s execution oriented is sharing all of that context. I attend meetings with other teams to share what we are doing, I review PRs to make sure we’re making small decisions in-line with larger goals, and hold standing team 1:1s to make sure each person feels confident in the direction we’re headed.</p>

<p><em>Coaching &amp; Culture</em> - The final category of work isn’t oriented towards delivering a product, but it’s still critically important to our organization’s long-term health to invest in our engineers. My personal …</p></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<hr>
<h2 id="everyone-wants-to-think-out-of-the-box-so-thats-not-thinking-out-of-the-box">Everyone wants to "think out of the box". So that's not thinking out of the box.</h2>
<p>Sometimes I think out of the box using the ideas from the people stuck in the box. Like, how can I take this idea that is stuck in the box, and liberate it from the box…you know what…nevermind. I’ll just explain.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-fresh-source-of-content">A Fresh Source of Content</h3>
<p>So you may have heard that the dark web contains whistle blowers, free thinkers, radical innovators, and such like these, though you might run into a bad guy every now and then.</p>
<p>So before drawing out a large commentary on this subject, let me illustrate it with a common analogy, but slightly modified so as to exit the box.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/it-came-from-the-dark-web/paradigm-shift.png" alt="The Paradigm Shift of Thinking in the Box"></p>
<p>So in this case (and by this analogy only) the big dark box that people are thinking in is in the dark web. So to think “out of the box” as you’ve been told to do, you might have to <em>go into the box</em>. Consider this picture above: The <em><strong>text you do see</strong></em> is what is clearly written on the image. But the ALT TEXT in the image tag which you will probably not see says <strong>“The Paradigm Shift of Thinking in the Box”</strong>.</p>
<p>Unless you have a setting on your browser that shows alt text immediately, you wouldn’t discover this unless you dug for it, specifically. But then, why would you do that? You didn’t know it would be useful. It was hidden anyways. But there is an entire network that behaves like that Alt Text I just mentioned. (The hidden web, obviously).</p>
<h3 id="more-on-the-box">More on the Box…</h3>
<p>Ok, so your teacher or parents or marketing guru (who could benefit by you) said its a good thing to think out of the box. And maybe, like me, you thought you’d listen. But did the teacher ever tell you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the box?</li>
<li>Poke holes in the box?</li>
<li>Shake the box?</li>
<li>Expose the box to rain and sun?</li>
<li>Put a king snake in the box?</li>
<li>Hide stuff in the box?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your not limited to thinking only outside the box. The box is really your plaything. Come and go at will. Why limit yourself to the place outside the box? Or in the box? Or why not switch to a bag, safe, or crate?</p>
<h3 id="thus-we-may-use-the-box-to-our-advantage">Thus, we may use the box to our advantage.</h3>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/it-came-from-the-dark-web/ben-linus.jpg" alt="What if I told you that somewhere on this island there’s a very large box and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box there it would be."></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What if I told you that somewhere on this island there’s a very large box and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box there it would be.”” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Linus">Ben Linus</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since in this case we are considering the dark web as being the box (the box that NOBODY SHOULD ENTER) we can now think out of the box by going into the box.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-the-keynote-address">And now, the Keynote Address</h2>
<p>Search engines can easily judge the originality of content based on other content that appeared before it on the <em>clearnet</em>. But at this time they <em>generally</em> don’t know what exists in the dark net (its hard to crawl, not reliable, among other issues).</p>
<p>In the ice-berg picture above (which is a fitting and accurate example) you can see that the dark net is far bigger than the clear net.</p>
<p>So you could, literally, <em><strong>just search for cool ideas and content from the dark web and place it on your clear web website</strong></em>. And the result would be, according to search engines: <strong>You</strong> <em>have new and authentic content</em>.</p>
<p>Adding to that, due to the source (the dark net), your “authentic” content will probably be unique  (to the clear net). Dark net authors often think differently. That’s why they are there.</p>
<p>You probably think I’m telling you to steal content from the dark web.</p>
<p>Stealing content is not what I’m suggesting.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m suggesting this, rather:</p>

<p>While its questionable where his success came from (indeed, we cannot assume inspiration or quality of art) he certainly knew a thing or two about inspiration: Radical inspiration comes from a place we don’t visit often*.</p>
<p>*(<em>That’s why I’m an avid bible reader that no longer sets foot in churches. Churches are, in my opinion, the dark side of the dark web of religion, but the bible is the “radical” book that goes against the establishment. And, oddly, most bibles come in black, though containing much light.</em>).</p>
<p><em><strong>Hence</strong></em>, using the <em><strong>hidden net can give you ideas that were previously unknown to you</strong></em>, because they are not a part of your common world or common experiences via mainstream television or mainstream internet (or mainstream books).</p>
<p>And you can draw from that.</p>

<p>Like I acknowledged at the beginning of this article, the dark web contains bad guys, though occasionally you might run into whistle blowers, free thinkers, radical innovators, and the like.</p>
<p>The dark web does not exist to be searchable, unless the authors intend it. Likewise, your chances on stumbling upon genuinely evil content is also based on the entry points you use. Finding innovation will start with innovation.</p>
<p>Hence, I would suggest NOT just jumping into the dark web based on the popular entry points, but find a strategy to obtain links and onion connections from useful darkweb sites that explore innovation or new ideas that are challenged by dominant opinion. Avert your eyes from things that are genuinely dark.</p>
<p>Its true with websites as its true with people: Birds of a feather flock together. So if you start with sites that are intellectual and progressive in nature, you are not likely to come into evil territories quickly. On the other hand, if you start with a site like The Hidden Wiki…you’d better know what your doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Endnote:</p>
<p>You probably think I’m telling you to visit the dark web…</p>
<p>You could I suppose.</p>
<p>Its actually much better to read the scriptures. The best inspiration comes from places people rarely visit. <a href="https://scrollmapper.github.io/pages/apocryphal/">That would reveal much to you that you didn’t know you didn’t know…</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200910082737/https://scrollmapper.github.io/pages/apocryphal/">archived</a>)</p>
<p>Some times the most useful things are hidden for a reason.</p>

<h3><a href="https://xn--rpa.cc/index.html">ʞ</a> / <a href="https://xn--rpa.cc/irl/index.html">essays</a> /</h3>



<p>so here's a short tutorial on ansi escape codes and terminal control, because you philistines won't stop using ncurses and oh my god <em>WHY ARE WE STILL USING NCURSES IT IS THE TWENTY FIRST FUCKING CENTURY</em></p>

<p>the way terminal emulators handle fancy things like color and cursor shape aren't some mysterious opaque black box you can only access through a library. accessing these capabilities is actually extremely simple; they can even be hardcoded into a text file and displayed by <code>cat</code> or <code>less</code>. or even <a href="http://xn--rpa.cc/ansiglot">curl</a>! the way you do this is with something called <em>ANSI escape sequences.</em></p>

<p>almost all UI changes in a terminal are accomplished through in-band signalling. these signals are triggered with the ASCII/UTF-8 character <strong>‹ESC›</strong> (<code>0x1B</code> or <code>27</code>). it's the same <strong>‹ESC›</strong> character that you send to the terminal when you press the <code>Escape</code> key on your keyboard or a key sequence involving the <code>Alt</code> key. (typing <strong>‹A-c›</strong> for instance sends the characters <strong>‹ESC›</strong> and <strong>‹c›</strong> in very rapid succession; this is why you'll notice a delay in some terminal programs after you press the escape key — it's waiting to try and determine whether the user hit <code>Escape</code> or an alt-key chord.)</p>

<p>the simplest thing we can do with these escapes is to make the text <strong>bold</strong> (or "bright"). we accomplish this by sending the terminal the <strong>‹ESC›</strong> character followed by <code>[1m</code>. <code>[</code> is a character indicating to the terminal what kind of escape we're sending, <code>1</code> indicates bold/bright mode, and <code>m</code> is the control character for formatting escapes.</p>

<p>all text sent after this escape sequence will be bold until we explicitly turn it off again (even if your program terminates). there are two ways we can turn off bright mode: by clearing formatting entirely, using the <code>m</code> formatting command with no arguments or the argument <code>0</code>, or more specifically clearing the bold bit with the <code>21m</code> command. (you'll notice that you can usually turn off modes by prefixing the same number with <code>2</code>.)</p>

<p>in a C program, this might look like the following:</p>

<code><b>#include</b> <cite>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</cite>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)
<strong>int</strong> main() {
	write(1, szstr(<em>"plain text - \x1b[1mbold text\x1b[0m - plain text"</em>));
}
</code>

<p>the <code>\x1b</code> escape here is a C string escape that inserts hex character <code>0x1B</code> (<strong>‹ESC›</strong>) into the string. it's kind of ugly and unreadable if you're not used to reading source with explicit escapes in it. you can make it a lot less horrible with a handful of defines, tho:</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)

<span>#define</span>     plain "0" /* or "" */
<span>#define</span>        no "2"
<span>#define</span>    bright "1"
<span>#define</span>       dim "2"
<span>#define</span>    italic "3"
<span>#define</span> underline "4"
<span>#define</span>   reverse "7"
<span>#define</span>      with ";"
<span>#define</span>  ansi_esc "\x1b"
<span>#define</span> fmt(style) ansi_esc "[" style "m"

<span>int</span> main() {
	write(1, szstr(    <em>"plain text - "</em>
		fmt(bright)     <em>"bright text"</em>     fmt(no bright) <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(dim)       <em>"dim text"</em>        fmt(no dim)    <em>" - "</em> 
		fmt(italic)    <em>"italic text"</em>     fmt(no italic) <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(reverse)   <em>"reverse video"</em>   fmt(plain)     <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(underline) <em>"underlined text"</em> fmt(no underline) )
	);
}
</code>

<p>the beauty of this approach is that all the proper sequences are generated at <em>compile time</em>, meaning the compiler turns all that into a single string interpolated with the raw escapes. it offers much more readability for the coder at zero cost to the end user.</p>

<p>but hang on, where's that semicolon coming from? it turns out, ansi escape codes let you specify multiple formats per sequence. you can separate each command with a <code>;</code>. this would allow us to write formatting commands like <code>fmt(underline with bright with no italic)</code>, which translates into <code>\x1b[4;1;23m</code> at compile time.</p>

<p>of course, being able to style text isn't nearly good enough. we also need to be able to color it. there are two components to a color command: what we're trying to change the color of, and what color we want to change it to. both the foreground and background can be given colors separately - despite what ncurses wants you to believe, you do not have to define """color pairs""" with each foreground-background pair you're going to use. this is a ridiculous archaism that nobody in the 21st fucking century should be limited by.</p>

<p>to target the foreground, we send the character <code>3</code> for normal colors or <code>9</code> for bright colors; to target the background, we send <code>4</code> for normal or <code>10</code> for bright. this is then followed by a color code selecting one of the traditional 8 terminal colors.</p>

<p>note that the "bright" here is both the same thing and something different from the "bright" mode we mentioned earlier. while turning on the "bright" mode will automatically shift text it applies to the bright variant of its color <em>if</em> it is set to one of the traditional 8 colors, setting a "bright color" with <code>9</code> or <code>10</code> will not automatically make the text bold.</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)

<span>#define</span> fg "3"
<span>#define</span> br_fg "9"
<span>#define</span> bg "4"
<span>#define</span> br_bg "10"
<span>#define</span> with ";"
<span>#define</span>      plain ""
<span>#define</span>      black "0"
<span>#define</span>        red "1"
<span>#define</span>      green "2"
<span>#define</span>     yellow "3"
<span>#define</span>       blue "4"
<span>#define</span>    magenta "5"
<span>#define</span>       cyan "6"
<span>#define</span>      white "7"
<span>#define</span>   ansi_esc "\x1b"
<span>#define</span> fmt(style) ansi_esc "[" style "m"

<span>int</span> main() {
	write(1, szstr(
		<em>"plain text - "</em>
		fmt(fg blue) <em>"blue text"</em> fmt(plain)               <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(br_fg blue) <em>"bright blue text"</em> fmt(plain)     <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(br_bg red) <em>"bright red background"</em> fmt(plain) <em>" - "</em>
		fmt(fg red with br_bg magenta) <em>"hideous red text"</em> fmt(plain))
	);
}
</code>

<p>when we invoke <code>fmt(fg red with br_bg magenta)</code>, this is translated by the compiler into the command string <code>\x1b[31;105m</code>. note that we're using <code>fmt(plain)</code> (<code>\x1b[m</code>) to clear the coloring here; this is because if you try to reset colors with, for instance, <code>fmt(fg black with bg white)</code>, you'll be overriding the preferences of users who have their terminal color schemes set to anything but that exact pair. additionally, if the user happens to have a terminal with a transparent background, a set background color will create ugly colored blocks around text instead of letting whatever's behind the window display correctly.</p>

<p>now, while it is more polite to use the "8+8" colors because they're a color palette the end-user can easily configure (she might prefer more pastel colors than the default harsh pure-color versions, or change the saturation and lightness to better fit with her terminal background), if you're doing anything remotely interesting UI-wise you're going to run up against that limit very quickly. while you can get a bit more mileage by mixing colors with styling commands, if you want to give <em>any</em> configurability to the user in terms of color schemes (as you rightly should), you'll want access to a much broader palette of colors.</p>

<p>to pick from a 256-color palette, we use a slightly different sort of escape: <code>\x1b[38;5;<em>(color)</em>m</code> to set the foreground and <code>\x1b[48;5;<em>(color)</em>m</code> to set the background, where <em>(color)</em> is the palette index we want to address. these escapes are even more unwieldy than the 8+8 color selectors, so it's even more important to have good abstraction.</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</em>
<span>#define</span> szstr(str) str,sizeof(str)

<span>#define</span>       with ";"
<span>#define</span>      plain ";"
<span>#define</span> wfg(color) "38;5;" #color
<span>#define</span> wbg(color) "48;5;" #color
<span>#define</span>   ansi_esc "\x1b"
<span>#define</span> fmt(style) ansi_esc "[" style "m"

<span>int</span> main() {
	write(1, szstr(<em>"plain text - "</em>
		fmt(wfg(198) with wbg(232))
			<em>"rose text on dark grey"</em>
		fmt(plain) <em>" - "</em>
		
		fmt(wfg(232) with wbg(248))
			<em>"dark grey on light grey"</em>
		fmt(plain) <em>" - "</em>
		
		fmt(wfg(248) with wbg(232))
			<em>"light grey on dark grey"</em>
		fmt(plain))
	);
}
</code>
<p>here, the stanza <code>fmt(wfg(248) with wbg(232))</code> translates into <code>\x1b[38;5;248;48;5;232m</code>. we're hard-coding the numbers here for simplicity but as a rule of thumb, any time you're using 8-bit colors in a terminal, you should <em>always</em> make them configurable by the user.</p>

<p>the opaque-seeming indexes are actually very systematic, and you can calculate which index to use for a particular color with the formula <code>16 + 36 * r + 6 * g + b</code>, where <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> are integers ranging between 0 and 5. indices 232 through 255 are a grayscale ramp from dark (232) to light (255).</p>

<p>of course, this is still pretty restrictive. 8-bit color may have been enough for '90s CD-ROM games on Windows, but it's long past it's expiration date. using true color is much more flexible. we can do this through the escape sequence <code>\x1b[38;2;<em>(r)</em>;<em>(g)</em>;<em>(b)</em>m</code> where each component is an integer between 0 and 255.</p>

<p>sadly, true color isn't supported on many terminals, urxvt tragically included. for this reason, your program should never rely on it, and abstract these settings away to be configured by the user. defaulting to 8-bit color is a good choice, as every reasonable modern terminal has supported it for a long time now.</p>

<p>but, for users of XTerm, kitty, Konsole, and libVTE-based terminal emulators (such as gnome-terminal, mate-terminal, and termite), it's polite to have a 24-bit color mode in place. for example:</p>

<code><span>#include</span> <em>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</em>
<span>#include</span> <em>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</em>
<span>#include</span> <em>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</em>

	<span>enum</span> color_mode { trad, trad_bright, b8, b24 } mode;
	<span>union</span> {
		<span>uint8_t</span> color;
		<span>struct</span> { <span>uint8_t</span> r, g, b; };
	}
};
<span>struct</span> style {
	unsigned <span>char</span> bold      : 1;
	unsigned <span>char</span> underline : 1;
	unsigned <span>char</span> italic    : 1;
	unsigned <span>char</span> dim       : 1;
	unsigned <span>char</span> reverse   : 1;
};
<span>struct</span> format {
	<span>struct</span> style style;
	<span>struct</span> color fg, bg;
};

<span>struct</span> format
	fmt_menu = {

	},
	fmt_menu_hl = {
		{1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
		{trad_bright, 7},

	};

<span>void</span> apply_color(<span>bool</span> bg, <span>struct</span> color c) {

		case b24: printf(<em>"%c8;2;%u;%u;%u"</em>, bg ? <em>'4'</em> : <em>'3'</em>, c.r, c.b, c.g);
	}
}

<span>void</span> fmt(struct format f) {

            <h3>Powerful Strings</h3>
            <p>
              There are four ways to express strings: basic, multi-line basic, literal, and
              multi-line literal. <span>Basic strings</span> are surrounded by
              quotation marks:
            </p>
          </div>

          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>str1 = "I'm a string."
str2 = "You can \"quote\" me."
str3 = "Name\tJos\u00E9\nLoc\tSF."</code></pre>

          <p>
            <span>Multi-line basic strings</span> Multi-line basic strings are
            surrounded by three quotation marks on each side and allow newlines. Include a line
            ending backslash to automatically trim whitespace preceeding any non-whitespace
            characters:
          </p>

          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>str1 = """
Roses are red
Violets are blue"""

str2 = """\
  The quick brown \
  fox jumps over \
  the lazy dog.\
  """</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code> str2</code> becomes
            <code>"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."</code>
            (a single sentence with no line breaks).
          </p>

          <p>
            <span> Literal strings</span> are surrounded by single quotes. No
            escaping is performed so what you see is what you get:
          </p>

          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>path = 'C:\Users\nodejs\templates'
path2 = '\\User\admin$\system32'
quoted = 'Tom "Dubs" Preston-Werner'
regex = '&lt;\i\c*\s*&gt;'</code></pre>

          <p>
            Since there is no escaping, there is no way to write a single quote inside a literal
            string enclosed by single quotes. That's where
            <span>multi-line literal strings</span> come in:
          </p>
          <pre data-controller="snippet" data-snippet-copy="false"><code>re = '''\d{2} apps is t[wo]o many'''
lines = '''
The first newline is
trimmed in raw strings.
All other whitespace
is preserved.
'''</code></pre>

After all, space is big, and you can't write your swashbuckling Hornblower-in-space novel if you have to wait for a generation ship to crawl painfully slowly between the nearest stars, much less try to cross a galaxy.</p><p>However, faster-than-light communication (which includes travel) breaks something very fundamental about physics, something that is often ignored by sci-fi, and difficult for non-physicists to understand. If you allow faster-than-light (FTL), then you break causality: you are allowing time-travel. One pithy way of saying this is:</p><p>Pick two:</p><ul><li>Relativity</li><li>Causality</li><li>FTL</li></ul><p>The Universe has picked relativity and causality, it seems. Thus, we cannot travel or communicate faster than light.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_15584"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_16992"><div><p>But why is this? Why does FTL imply time travel. To demonstrate this, it's handy to draw some diagrams. We're going to work with "spacetime diagrams." They look like this:</p><p>Here I'm trying to draw all four dimensions of the Universe: three space and one time. Now, I can't draw four dimensions. I can't even really draw three (it's a 2D screen, after all). So I've suppressed two space dimensions, drawing all of space as just a line. It won't matter much for what I'm trying to do, but it's good to keep that in mind.</p><p>With that in mind, I'm showing here <em>my </em>spacetime diagram: I'm stationary at the center, and so I see time tick forward "orthogonal" (perpendicular) to the space directions around me. As you'll see, other people have different spacetime diagrams, and different time and space axes, relative to me. That's the point of relativity, after all.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_21377"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_22820"><div><p>The special thing about relativity is that <em>everyone measures the speed of light to be the same</em>. We show this in a spacetime diagram by saying that every spacetime diagram has light traveling at 45 degrees relative to the time axis. Light travels on lines that are called "null."</p><p>Here I'm showing the null lines of light emitted from an event at the time I'm calling <em>t=0</em>&nbsp;(when the time and space axis cross). Remember I'm suppressing most of the space dimensions: these rays of light are really emanating out in a sphere around me. Because light travels at 45 degrees, anything traveling slower than light from this <em>t=0</em>&nbsp;event is closer to the time axis than the light rays, and anything faster than light is further away from the time axis.</p><p>The light rays define the <em>future lightcone</em>. This is the set of spacetime events that can perceive the event at <em>t=0,</em>&nbsp;and so, in a Universe without FTL, all the events that can be affected by whatever happened at this event at <em>t=0.&nbsp;</em>There is also a past lightcone, which would be the 45 degree lines extending backwards in time from the event: in a Universe without FTL this defines all the events that could have effected that <em>t=0</em>&nbsp;event, because the light (and thus things moving slower than light)&nbsp;from those other events had time to reach the <em>t=0</em>&nbsp;event.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_40995"><div><p>So now let me move from general spacetime diagrams to an example that will indicate why FTL implies time travel. Let's consider a specific example: Let's say we on Earth have built a FTL communication device that let's us talk to the inhabitants of the planet Proxima Centauri B, 4.25 lightyears away. Again, this is what a FTL and slower-than-light set of communications would appear like in a spacetime diagram.</p><p>Critically, I've drawn the time axis for the Proximal Centaurians parallel to our own time. This is because Proxima Centauri is moving at essentially the same velocity as Earth (the differences are small compared to the speed of light). Thus, there are no big relativistic effects between our counting of time and the Proximal Centaurians.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let's imagine that some event occurs away from Earth, oriented in such a way that the light from the event hits us before it reaches Proxima Centauri. The spacetime diagram for that would look like what I've shown. First we see the light, then the light reaches Proxima Centauri. Notice I've drawn the light rays from the event traveling at 45 degrees to my time axis. After all, it is light, and light travels at 45 degrees on spacetime diagrams.</p></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;existingGallery&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;show-meta-only-title&quot;:false,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;methodOption&quot;:&quot;transient&quot;,&quot;design&quot;:&quot;grid&quot;,&quot;aspectRatio&quot;:null,&quot;square-thumbs&quot;:false,&quot;aspect-ratio&quot;:&quot;square&quot;,&quot;thumbnails-per-row&quot;:2,&quot;padding&quot;:5,&quot;lightbox&quot;:false,&quot;collectionId&quot;:&quot;57bfa8b3f5e2312269858e10&quot;,&quot;vSize&quot;:null,&quot;transientGalleryId&quot;:&quot;57bfa8b3f5e2312269858e10&quot;}" data-block-type="8" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_57296"><div>

This only works when everyone is moving in the same frame of reference, like us and Proxima Centauri (really we're not in the same rest frame, but its close enough not to matter). So, to see the problem, let's add a new observer, moving at high speeds relative to Earth and Proxima Centauri. It's sci-fi, so we add a relativistic spaceship. It's moving with <em>v&lt;c</em>&nbsp;but <em>v&gt;&gt;0</em>, so it's trajectory on my spacetime diagram is highly skewed relative to my time axis: it's nearly moving at the speed of light.</p><p>Here's where the relativistic effects start coming into play. Relativity tells us that everyone moving with constant velocity is totally justified in saying they are stationary. Thus, we think we're stationary (ignore the rotation of the Earth, or its orbit around the Sun). The Proximal Centaurians think they're at rest. The people on the relativistic spaceship think they are at rest. So they can draw their spacetime diagram, with their own time axis. That time axis, like mine, is always where they are: on the ship. So I think their time axis is aligned with the ship trajectory.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_5_1472176913301_80257"><div>

<p><strong>Work in progress</strong>: I still need to clean this up &amp; add the complete source code. ETA for a more or less done version is Soon(TM).<br>
<strong>Last updated</strong>: 2020/09/10 because how the eff did this end up on the front page of Hacker News? :D<br>
<strong>Suggestions welcome</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/AnotherKamila/kamila.is/issues/new?labels=teaching&amp;title=[teaching/how-routers-work]+Title">complain</a> if something is unclear or wrong!</p>

<p>This is the inside view of how exactly a router operates. You only need to know this if you are poking inside a router implementation. If that is the case, my condolences.</p>

<p>At the end of this exposition, I will give you the complete source code to a functional router (written in <a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a>, the new &amp; shiny software-defined networking thing). My aim is that you will understand every line of that.</p>

<p>I accompany my explanations below with some P4 code. I think it is useful to read it even if you’ve never seen P4, because it shows a bit more detail than the text and I believe that it is sufficiently pseudocode-ish. Here is a summary of what you need to know to read it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>everything happens per packet</li>
  <li><code>hdr</code> are the packet’s parsed headers</li>
  <li><code>standard_metadata</code> is how you tell the switch to do things with the packet (like send it on a specific port)</li>
  <li><code>meta</code> are user-defined in-memory variables which can be used e.g. for matching in tables</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Figuring out what should be done with packets is done by <em>the control plane/in the slow path/on the CPU/by the controller</em> or similar phrases. I will refer to all of this as “the control plane”.</li>
  <li>Actually forwarding the packets  is done by <em>the data plane/in the fast path/in the hardware/in the switch</em> and such. I will refer to this as “the data plane”.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24436585">Cyph0n on HN did a good job explaining this distinction.</a></p>



<p>A <em>switch</em> (or an L2 switch :-) ) is an L2-only<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> thing. It knows about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses and ports<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. It does <strong>not</strong> know about anything like IP addresses. It has a <strong>MAC table</strong>: it maps MAC addresses to ports.</p>

<p>A <em>router</em> (or an L3 switch by some people’s vocabulary) operates on L3 only. It knows about L3 stuff such as IP addresses and interfaces and hosts. It does <strong>not</strong> know about L2 stuff such as MAC addresses or ports.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> In fact, the routing parts of the router would not have to be changed at all if you decided to use something other than ethernet on L2. It has a <strong>routing table</strong> (details later): a table of subnets/prefixes and how to reach them.</p>

<p>What you normally call a router (that box sitting over there) is actually a router (for handling L3) and one or more switches (for handling L2), and some glue in between. They may in fact be separate chips in hardware.</p>

<p>You need glue to put together the L2 and the L3. This “L2.5” glue is ARP (or NDP for IPv6). It usually lives in the router, but it is glue, not routing, and you can think about it separately.</p>

<h2 id="the-data-plane-life-of-a-packet">The Data Plane: Life of a Packet</h2>

<p>When a packet arrives and needs to be sent further, these things have to happen to it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It needs to be <em>routed</em>: the <strong>router</strong>, based on L3 information, decides where it needs to go, in L3 speak – it will decide which <em>host</em> to send it to, but not how. This corresponds to the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing table</a></em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be passed down to L2: this is where the L2.5 ARP/NDP <strong>glue</strong> translates the L3-speak IP address to L2-speak MAC address. This is the <em>ARP table</em>.</li>
  <li>It needs to be <em>forwarded</em> on the correct port: the <strong>switch</strong> puts the packet on the correct port. This is the <em>MAC table</em>.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="life-of-a-packet-now-properly">Life of a Packet, Now Properly</h2>

<h3 id="1-it-needs-to-be-routed-l3router">1. “It needs to be routed”: L3/router</h3>

<p>The packet has a destination IP address. This is matched in the <em>routing table</em>, using a longest-prefix match (LPM), i.e. it matches IP address prefixes. It may either be for a host the router is directly connected to (on some interface), or it may need to be sent further, through a <em>gateway</em> (through some interface). Therefore: <strong>The routing table maps a <em>prefix</em> to either <em>a next hop through a gateway and an interface</em>, or <em>a direct connection through an interface</em></strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>routing_table : Prefix -&gt; NextHop (GatewayIP, Interface) | Direct Interface
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the next hop’s IP address is in the router’s memory only: it does not appear in the packet at any time.</p>

<p>The P4 code defining the IPv4 routing table is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>action ipv4_through_gateway(ipv4_addr_t gateway, interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = gateway;  // send through the gateway
}

action ipv4_direct(interface_t iface) {
    meta.out_interface = iface;
    meta.ipv4_next_hop = hdr.ipv4.dst_addr;  // send directly to the destination
}

table ipv4_routing {
    key = {
        hdr.ipv4.dst_addr: lpm;  // match prefixes
    }
    actions = {
        ipv4_through_gateway;    // ipv4_through_gateway(gateway, iface)
        ipv4_direct;             // ipv4_direct(iface)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();     // If there is no route, drop it -- in reality, we might want to
                                 // send an ICMP "No route to host" packet.
                                 // Note that this is the default route, so control plane might
                                 // want to set a default gateway here instead of dropping.
    size = ROUTING_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(and the exact same thing for IPv6)</p>

<h3 id="2-it-needs-to-be-passed-down-l25arp-glue">2. “It needs to be passed down”: L2.5/ARP glue</h3>

<p>If we did not drop the packet because there was no route, we now know the IP address and interface of the next hop. (Note that this is a host that is connected to us directly – it is sitting on the same wire.)
We need to translate this into an L2 MAC address in order to pass it to the switch. We do it via the ARP table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arp_table : (IPv4Address, Interface) -&gt; MACAddress
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: <code>Interface</code> conceptually belongs there, but <code>IPv4Address</code> should be unique. We need to store the interface in the control plane anyway, because we want to pre-emptively re-send ARP requests when an entry is about to expire, but in the data plane it is not strictly necessary.</p>

<p>An interesting question arises here: What do we do if there is no match, i.e. when we don’t know the MAC address for the IP? First, we send an ARP request. Then, most routers drop the packet (relying on either retransmissions or “nobody will miss it”). Storing the packet until the ARP reply comes back (or until it expires) would also work, but usually isn’t done.
Sending ARP requests is normally done in the control plane, because the ARP requests need to be throttled and expired and such.</p>

<p>P4 code:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>action set_dst_mac(mac_addr_t dst_addr) {
    hdr.ethernet.dst_addr = dst_addr;
}

table ipv4_arp {
    key = {
        meta.ipv4_next_hop: exact;     // next_hop is the host we found in the routing step; we want to send to that
        // meta.out_interface: exact;  // conceptually this belongs here, but actually next_hop should be unique, so
                                       // we can leave it out
    }
    actions = {
        set_dst_mac;                // set_dst_mac(mac)
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>IPv6 uses NDP instead of ARP, which is different but the same ;-)</p>

<h3 id="3-it-needs-to-be-forwarded-l2switch">3. “It needs to be forwarded”: L2/switch</h3>

<p>This is L2 / the switch. It works on each interface separately (it could be multiple chips in hardware). It gets a packet with some destination MAC address, and it decides on which port it should put it. It uses a <em>MAC table</em> to do it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mac_table : MACAddress -&gt; Port
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>P4 code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// note: we're operating on metadata.out_interface

action set_out_port(port_t ports) {
    standard_metadata.egress_spec = ports;
}

action broadcast() {
    // Implementation depends on the switch.
    // In v1model, use a multicast group corresponding to all ports on metadata.out_interface.
}

// we call it dmac -- see below why
table dmac {
    key = {
        hdr.ethernet.dst_addr: exact;
    }
    actions = {
        set_out_port;  // set_out_port(port)
        broadcast;     // no params, uses metadata.out_interface
                       // remember to set broadcast for 0xffffffffffff in the control plane
        drop;
    }
    default_action = drop();
    size = ARP_TABLE_SIZE;  // we can have at most as many ports as MAC addresses
}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: Real switches are a bit more complicated than that: for example, redundant links mean that a MAC address may be on more than one port. However, you will notice when you need to think about this. Normally considering the simple version is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="the-logic-applying-the-tables">The logic: Applying the tables</h3>

<ol>
  <li>apply routing =&gt; find the next hop (either gateway or direct)</li>
  <li>apply ARP translation to the “next hop” host</li>
  <li>send out on the right port</li>
</ol>

<p>In P4:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apply {
    routing.apply();  // fills out metadata.next_hop
    arp.apply();      // sets pkt.ethernet.dst_addr to the MAC of next_hop
    dmac.apply();     // sends out on the port for pkt.ethernet.dst_addr
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note: While this is conceptually correct, we actually also want to apply the auxiliary table mentioned below. The full code contains that.)</p>

<h2 id="the-control-plane-how-to-fill-the-tables">The Control Plane: How to Fill the Tables</h2>

<p>Starting at the bottom for a change:</p>

<h3 id="l3--routing-table">L3 / routing table</h3>

<p>Filled out by the control plane, depending on the context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your home router, it probably has only two entries: the local network (something like 192.168.0.0/24) =&gt; direct on the internal interface, and a default route via your ISP’s gateway on the external interface.
 In this case, the routing table is static and is filled out by the firmware according to the settings.</li>
  <li>In a small company router, there might be a direct network such as 10.0.0.0/24, a remote office in 10.0.1.0/24 via a VPN server, and a default route from the ISP.
 The default route and the direct route would also be filled …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>
Docker is extremely popular these days.<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
Too bad it's not very good.
</p>

<p>
A note in advance:
This is absolutely not about Docker being too "opinionated" for me,
or other tools being more flexible.
I believe that learning and using Docker is just plain more complicated than learning and using the tools I describe below.
Docker is genuinely more complex and harder to use than the alternatives.
These tools also happen to be more flexible than Docker,
but that's not why I'm recommending them:
I'm recommending them because they are simpler to learn and use.
If they are indeed more flexible in addition to being simpler to use, then that's just due to an overall superior design.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1">
<h2 id="sec-1">Docker containers are not mysterious</h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
First, a brief explanation of how containers work.
Linux containers<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> are built on two kernel features, namespaces and cgroups.
Their architecture is quite easy to understand.
</p>

<p>
I encourage everyone to read the main namespaces man page: <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">man 7 namespaces</a>.
It's well written and makes it easy to grok the concept.
If you create a new instance of all<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> of these namespaces, you have something like a container.
</p>

<p>
The cgroups documentation (located at <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups-v1/">Documentation/cgroups-v1/</a> and <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt">Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt</a> in your local copy of the Linux source code) is less straightforward, 
but still a better explanation than I could write.
The basic idea is that cgroups are a mechanism for grouping processes.
This mechanism is used to implement other systems like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html">man 7 cpuset</a>, which are used to track and schedule the container processes.
</p>

<p>
If you make the appropriate system calls to move into a cpuset cgroup and create new namespaces, you have a container.
There's not much to it.
</p>

<p>
One could write a relatively short C program and create a Unix-style utility that uses these system calls to start up a new container.
You can see this for yourself by playing around with <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html">man 1 nsenter</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html">man 1 unshare</a>, which are the most minimal possible wrappers around the namespaces syscalls.
</p>

<p>
The point of explaining this is to show that the Linux container functionality is all rather simple.
Docker (or any other container software) are not doing anything especially mystifying in the specific area of bringing up a container.
Armed with that knowledge, let's look at what else Docker is actually doing.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Docker for building containers is superfluous</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
We'll start off with how Docker builds a container image for you.
You pull down some kind of image from the Docker hub, and Docker hums excitingly for a bit while you watch things scroll and progress bars fill.
What you end up with is a filesystem tree from some Linux distro, with a few things added in on top.
</p>

<p>
It may be surprising to some that we have been doing exactly this for multiple decades now.
</p>

<p>
In fact, you do this every time you install GNU/Linux on a machine.
The majority of the files in that filesystem tree come from packages from some distro.
And package managers are certainly capable of installing packages into arbitrary directories; that's how they install a new system.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most even have neat little wrapper scripts to do it for you! And these are only an <code>apt-get install debootstrap</code> (or equivalent) away!
To build filesystem trees for a few of the most popular distros<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debootstrap trusty /srv/trees/ubuntu</code>
</li>
<li><code>debootstrap stable /srv/trees/debian</code>
</li>
<li><code>yum -y --nogpg --releasever=22 --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo=fedora install fedora-release systemd passwd dnf fedora-release vim-minimal --installroot=/srv/trees/fedora</code>
</li>
<li><code>pacstrap /srv/trees/arch</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And of course you can select additional packages to install using these commands, or make other changes.
This has been used for decades to build chroots, which I'll say more about a bit later.
There are even more novel package managers,
like <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">nix</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/">guix</a>,
which have interesting features that can make things even easier.
</p>

<p>
But wait, the distro version of node.js (for example) is too out of date!
How am I going to get the latest version?
</p>

<p>
Well, the first thing you should do if you need more up to date versions is enable the updated package repositories for your distro:
Ubuntu backports, Debian backports, CentOS EPEL.
It may be surprising to some, but distros and package managers actually exist for a reason, 
and one of those reasons is that they make it easy to keep your system up to date.
(There are other advantages which I won't go into here<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>)
</p>

<p>
If a suitably updated version is not available through distro channels,
I am obligated to suggest that the next best option is 
to download the source of the distro package, update and rebuild it yourself, and install using that package.
Or, build the package yourself if one isn't available.
This can be a bit of a pain if you are in the early development stages
(though there are tools to make it easier<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>)
but again, there are many advantages.<sup><a id="fnr.5.100" name="fnr.5.100" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Most people, however, use the traditional hacks.
You can chroot in and just do your usual <code>pip install foo</code> or <code>gem install bar</code> or <code>npm install baz</code> or <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>,
just as you would with some "RUN" directives in a Dockerfile.
</p>

<p>
Wow! It's just like Docker!
No, Docker is just like this.
Hopefully it is becoming obvious that here, at least, there is no real advantage of Docker.
</p>

<p>
Crucially, you can use all the same install scripts that you would use with a normal Linux machine.
You don't need to rewrite everything into Dockerfiles.
You can do it manually, you can use shell scripts, you can use Ansible, 
you can write a boutique ConfigurationManagementFactory in Java, you can do whatever you like.
It's just installing software.
It's not complicated unless you make it complicated.
Supposedly, Dockerfiles are simpler than running <code>debootstrap</code> at the beginning of your script, but I'm not sure I understand why.
It seems to me that Docker is no simpler or easier than the standard way.
</p>

<p>
Now, it's true that Docker uses layering to be efficient in terms of disk space and time to build new containers.
It defaults to using <a href="http://aufs.sourceforge.net/aufs.html">AUFS</a> to do this.<sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
I think you could reimplement it easily yourself with a small shell script and some calls to mount;
but I haven't bothered.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I just use <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Manpage/btrfs-subvolume">man 8 btrfs-subvolume</a>.
btrfs is a copy on write filesystem which can instantly make space-efficient copies of filesystem trees in "subvolumes",
which the user sees as just regular directories.
</p>

<p>
You can build a stock Ubuntu filesystem tree into a subvolume with 
<code>btrfs subvolume create /srv/trees/ubuntu &amp;&amp; debootstrap trusty /srv/trees/ubuntu/</code>.
Then, when you want to build a new container with specific software,
you just copy that subvolume and perform your modifications on the copy;
that is, <code>btrfs subvolume snapshot /srv/trees/debian /srv/containers/webapp</code> and work on <code>/srv/containers/webapp</code>.
If you want to copy those modifications, you just take another snapshot.
</p>

<p>
This is arguably better, because there's no need to maintain a lot of state about the mount layerings and set them up again on reboot.
Your container filesystem just sits there in a volume waiting for you to start it.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, if you don't like btrfs for some reason,
you're perfectly able to use zfs, OverlayFS, AUFS, or whatever;
no need to have a "storage driver" implemented just to do some simple copy-on-write or layering operations.
</p>

<p>
And if you want to do some kind of change tracking as you build the system,
you should keep it at the proper layer,
or use dedicated tools.
<code>/usr</code> should be immutable and built from packages,
your application data should live in <code>/srv</code> or <code>/var</code> and be mounted in,
and so all the configuration data that is part of the system build should be in <code>/etc</code>.
To track this, you can just use <a href="http://etckeeper.branchable.com/">etckeeper</a> and store your <code>/etc</code> in a git repository.
which is right and proper since <code>/usr</code> should be immutable.
If you must, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/OSTree">OSTree</a> lets you version whole filesystems.
</p>

<p>
And if you still need to pull in a Docker image for some reason,
you can treat it as just another way to build a filesystem tree.
There are tools that will let you do that,
such as <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machinectl.html">machinectl pull-dkr</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3">
<h2 id="sec-3">Isolation for deployment is not new</h2>
<div id="text-3">
<p>
But wait! Docker isn't just a pointless abstraction layer over the simple task of building filesystem trees!
It lets you actually use those filesystem trees in containers!
</p>

<p>
Well, it may be a shock, but these tools that Docker uses - they actually exist for a reason.
As I said earlier, these tools have been used for decades to build chroots.
</p>

<p>
What's a chroot?
Well, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chroot.1.html">man 1 chroot</a> is a decades-old tool that lets you change what the root directory <code>/</code> points to;
for example, you could point <code>/</code> at <code>/srv/container/webapp</code>.
Everything looks for libraries and binaries in subdirectories of the root directory, like <code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/bin</code>.
So, by using chroot you can have an entirely different set of libraries and binaries;
when you run things inside the chroot, they will see just the libraries and software that you installed inside that filesystem tree.
</p>

<p>
To help explain what you can use a chroot for, here's a short little blurb I "wrote" about what you can do with chroot.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sysadmins use chroot to provide standardized environments for their development, QA, and production teams, reducing "works on my machine" finger-pointing.
By "chrooting" the app platform and its dependencies, sysadmins abstract away differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That sure sounds useful.
But wait, there's this new kid on the block, Docker.
Let's see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211030001/https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/">what they have to say</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Sysadmins use Docker to provide standardized environments for their development, QA, and production teams, reducing "works on my machine" finger-pointing.
By "Dockerizing" the app platform and its dependencies, sysadmins abstract away differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Docker is not novel in giving you these capabilities.
They're quite novel in marketing it so intensely, though.

These are all requirements that large organizations must implement to support their application teams across a wide variety of architectures and platforms: VMs, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP and so on.</p> <p>With Kuma – now a CNCF project and at the time of this writing, the only Envoy-based service mesh donated and accepted by the foundation – we have relentlessly executed on this vision with the community.</p> <p>Starting from Kuma 0.6, which was released this summer with a new advanced multi-zone capability, Kuma now supports every cloud vendor, every architecture and every platform together in a multi-mesh control plane. When deployed in a multi-zone deployment, Kuma abstracts away both the synchronization of the service mesh policies across multiple zones and the service connectivity (and service discovery) across those zones. A zone can be a Kubernetes cluster, a data center, a cloud region, a VPC, a subnet and so on – we can slice and dice zones to our liking, and we can also mix Kubernetes and VM workloads into one distributed mesh deployment.</p> <p><img src="https://2tjosk2rxzc21medji3nfn1g-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/diagram-02-1536x779.jpg" alt=""></p> <center><i>
Kuma creates a service connectivity overlay across hybrid infrastructure to discover and connect services automatically, including hybrid Kubernetes + VM services.
</i></center> <p>This <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/latest/documentation/deployments/#multi-zone-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-zone capability</a> has been added in addition to the <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/latest/policies/mesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-mesh support</a> that Kuma introduced since day one to create multiple isolated meshes on the same cluster (with dedicated mTLS CAs) in order to reduce team coordination, increase isolation and improve security rather than one large service mesh that everybody is sharing. Also, since multi-zone leverages the first-class K8s + VM support that shipped since the first version of Kuma, all teams and workloads in the organizations can benefit from service mesh and not just our greenfield initiatives.</p> <p>A Kuma service mesh distributed across every cloud, cluster and workload that the teams are using can therefore be managed from one individual cluster of Kuma itself. Meanwhile, multiple service meshes can be virtually provisioned on one Kuma control plane (horizontally scalable) to simplify mesh management across the organization – very similar to how Kubernetes and its namespaces work.</p> <p><img src="https://2tjosk2rxzc21medji3nfn1g-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/diagram-one-cluster-new@2x.png" alt=""></p> <center><i>
Kuma supports multiple virtual meshes on the same Kuma deployment, removing the requirement of having multiple service mesh clusters for each application and therefore lowering the ops costs significantly.
</i></center> <h3 id="extending-xds-with-kds"><a href="#extending-xds-with-kds">#</a> Extending xDS With KDS</h3> <p>In Kuma, we can deploy a distributed service mesh running across multiple clusters, clouds or regions by leveraging the “multi-zone” deployment mode. The “multi-zone” deployment is a new way of running Kuma that has been introduced in v0.6+ in addition to the “standalone” deployment mode (one service mesh per zone).</p> <p>In a multi-zone deployment, there are a few important features that Kuma provides:</p> <ol><li>There are two control plane modes: global and remote. This is quite unique in the service mesh landscape.</li> <li>There is a new DNS “.mesh” zone for service discovery.</li> <li>There is a new “Ingress” data plane proxy type that enables connectivity between zones within a Kuma mesh.</li></ol> <p>In a distributed deployment, the “global” control plane will be in charge of accepting Kuma resources to determine the behavior of the service mesh via either native Kubernetes CRDs or vanilla YAML in VM-based deployments. It will be in charge of propagating these resources to the “remote” control planes – one for each zone that we want to support.</p> <p>The “remote” control planes are going to be exchanging Kuma resources with the “global” control plane over an extension of the Envoy xDS API that we called KDS (Kuma Discovery Service) over a gRPC protocol, and therefore, over HTTP/2. The “remote” control planes are also going to be accepting requests from the Envoy-based data plane proxies that belong to the same zone over traditional xDS.</p> <p><img src="https://2tjosk2rxzc21medji3nfn1g-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/diagram-01-1536x1316.jpg" alt=""></p> <center><i>
The remote control planes also embed a DNS service discovery that can be used to discover services across different zones. The above architecture can be easily installed in just a few steps using either the Kuma CLI “kumactl” or HELM charts.
</i></center> <p>In Kuma, we abstract away the Envoy proxy process in a “kuma-dp” process so that the user never directly configures or starts “envoy”, therefore making the whole process of starting a data plane proxy much easier. Advanced users can still access the underlying “envoy” process if they want to.</p> <p>By leveraging the native xDS API of Envoy to connect “kuma-dp” with “remote” control planes in every zone as well as leveraging KDS to connect the “remote” control planes to the global control plane, effectively we have gRPC communication enabled across the entire service mesh infrastructure stack in a consistent way.</p> <p>The “global” and “remote” architecture has a few benefits:</p> <ol><li>We can scale each zone independently by scaling the “remote” control planes and achieve HA in case one zone experiences issues.</li> <li>There is no single point of failure: even if the “global” control plane goes down, we can still register and deregister data plane proxies on the “remote” ones, and the most updated addresses of every service can still be propagated to other Envoy-based sidecars.</li> <li>The “global” control plane allows us to automatically propagate the state across every zone, while at the same time making sure that the “remote” control planes are aware of each zone’s Kuma ingress in order to enable cross-zone connectivity.</li></ol> <p>The control plane separation governs how Kuma resources (like meshes and policies) are synchronized across the zones, but it requires two other components in order to enable discovery and connectivity at the data plane layer across our zones in an automated way: service discovery and the “ingress” data plane proxy mode.</p> <h3 id="cross-zone-discovery-and-connectivity"><a href="#cross-zone-discovery-and-connectivity">#</a> Cross-Zone Discovery and Connectivity</h3> <p>Like we described, a multi-zone deployment can be used to deploy a distributed service mesh across multiple clouds and clusters, as well as to enable seamless communication between services running in different zones, effectively providing cross-zone service discovery and connectivity.</p> <p>Among other use cases, cross-zone connectivity is useful for:</p> <ul><li>Enabling high availability across multiple Kubernetes clusters, regions and availability zones in both single and multi-cloud environments</li> <li>Enabling traffic shifting from one zone to another for disaster recovery</li> <li>Enabling a step-by-step transition of our applications from VMs to Kubernetes – or from physical data centers to the cloud – by leveraging traffic control policies to determine the conditions under which service traffic should be shifted from one zone to another.
Kuma’s multi-zone deployment enables cross-zone connectivity by providing two important features:</li></ul> <ol><li>A new “ingress” data plane proxy mode processes incoming traffic into a zone. There will be one Kuma ingress deployment per zone, that can be scaled horizontally as the traffic increases. The “ingress” data plane mode is being added in addition to the default proxying one and the “gateway” one (to support third-party API gateways). Because of the new “ingress” mode, Kuma doesn’t require a flat networking topology between zones and can support more complex infrastructure.</li> <li>A built-in service discovery DNS server resolves the address of a service to either an IP address of a replica in the same zone or the address of an ingress proxy in another zone.
Likewise with the “global” and “remote” control planes, the ingress and the DNS service discovery can also be installed in one click by following the <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/latest/documentation/deployments/#multi-zone-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-zone instructions</a> on Kuma.</li></ol> <p>When it comes to service discovery, Kuma creates a “.mesh” DNS entry on the built-in DNS resolver that can be used to resolve services across the same zone or in other zones, effectively “flattening” the discovery of services across a complex infrastructure. Kuma will – accordingly to the traffic routing policies that have been configured – determine if we should be consuming a replica of the service in the local zone or if we should resolve the request to the IP address of a Kuma ingress in another zone, which will then leverage SNI to determine what service has been requested and route the request accordingly.</p> <p><img src="https://2tjosk2rxzc21medji3nfn1g-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/diagram-03.jpg" alt=""></p> <center><i>
In this example, we have three services (users, invoices and billing). Requests to “invoices.mesh” will be proxied to an IP address within the same zone, whereas requests to “billing.mesh” will be <b>automatically</b> proxied to an ingress of another zone.
</i></center> <p>Since SNI resolution is mandatory for cross-zone communication, the <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/latest/policies/mutual-tls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mTLS policy</a> must be enabled on the mesh. Also, since Kuma already knows where all the services are running,  cross-zone discovery and connectivity happen automatically.</p> <p>When a new service is registered into Kuma, a new “kuma.io/zone” tag is added to the data plane definition so that we can use the <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/latest/documentation/dps-and-data-model/#tags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attribute-based policy selectors</a> to configure Kuma policies like <a href="https://kuma.io/docs/latest/policies/traffic-route/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Traffic Route</a> to determine the behavior of cross-zone traffic (blue/green or canary across different zones, weighted traffic, as well as traffic shifting).</p> <p>When consuming any “{service-name}.mesh” on default port 80 (even if the service is not listening on port 80), the DNS resolver – in addition to resolving the address of the service – will also automatically resolve the port of the destination service and inject it into the connection in order to keep the uptime of the overall connectivity even when a team decides to re-assign ports of a service that other teams may be using. This feature reduces the team coordination required to maintain a large number of services and connections in a Kuma mesh.</p> <h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h3> <p>Thanks to the new multi-zone capability that Kuma provides since v0.6+, we can now easily run a service mesh across multiple Kubernetes clusters, clouds and regions. Since Kuma natively supports both containerized and VM workloads, this …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I originally wrote an earlier version of this post at the end of March, when I was working on adding uprobes support to <a href="https://github.com/redsift/redbpf">redbpf</a>. I wanted to blog about the work I was doing and needed an application to instrument for the purpose of this post. At that time Zoom's popularity was rising quickly, and I happened to read somewhere that it supported this creepy attention tracking feature that allowed meeting hosts to monitor if attendees were paying attention. I figured I could try to use uprobes to snoop into the data Zoom was sending to their servers and see how the tracking worked.</p><p>But then Zoom quickly started getting under a lot of fire. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombombing">Zoombombing</a> became a thing, several security issues were discovered and pretty much everyone started piling on the company. Considering all that, I was advised and ultimately decided not to publish the post.</p><p>Now things seem to have settled, Zoom <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/a-message-to-our-users/">improved their security</a> and by popular demand <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000538083-Attendee-attention-tracking">got rid of attention tracking</a>. So I think I can finally publish this! I edited out the part about attention tracking (which no longer exists) and a couple of other things that could potentially get me in trouble.</p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I wrote a command line tool that uses BPF uprobes to intercept the TLS encrypted data that zoom sends over the network, and here I'm going to show the process I went through to write it. After I wrote this post I made the tool generic so that it can now instrument any program that uses OpenSSL. I published the code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy</a>.</p><h2>Instrumenting applications with uprobes</h2><p>Uprobes let you instrument user space applications by attaching custom code to arbitrary locations inside a target process. It's a bit like running an application in a debugger, setting breakpoints and fiddling around, but programmatically and without the overhead of a debugger.</p><p>An uprobe must be <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/cargo_bpf/#building">compiled</a> and <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/load/struct.Loader.html">loaded</a> like any other BPF program, then it can be attached with the following API:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>attach_uprobe</span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    fn_name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    offset</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>u64</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    target</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>    pid</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>pid_t</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p><a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf/struct.UProbe.html#method.attach_uprobe">attach_uprobe()</a> parses the <code>target</code> ELF binary or shared library, looks up the function <code>fn_name</code>, and once the target is running it injects the probe code at the resolved address. If <code>offset</code> is non-zero, its value is added to the address of <code>fn_name</code>. If <code>fn_name</code> is <code>None</code>, then <code>offset</code> is interpreted as starting from the beginning of the target's <code>.text</code> section. Finally if a <code>pid</code> is given, the probe will only be attached to the process with the given id.</p><p>In the rest of the post I'm going to show some examples of uprobes, focusing on the code that gets compiled to BPF bytecode, loaded in the kernel and then injected in the target process (in our case zoom). I'm not going to show much of the user-space code that loads the probes. That part is pretty standard rust code that does some setup, then prints out the data coming from the probes as it receives it. If you're interested you can still find all the user-space code at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs">https://github.com/alessandrod/snuffy/blob/master/src/main.rs</a>.</p><h2>Poking into Zoom</h2><p>We're going to use uprobes to inspect the network traffic between the zoom client and the company's servers. Zoom uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security</a> to encrypt the data. In order to intercept the <em>unencrypted</em> data, we need to find out which TLS library is used by the client, then attach uprobes to strategic places inside it.</p><p>Let's start with searching for common TLS symbols using <code>objdump</code>:</p><pre><code><span>$ objdump -CT /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -iE "ssl|gnutls"
</span>000000000080d5b0 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_blockUnknownSSLCertChanged()
<!-- -->000000000080d590 g    DF .text	0000000000000013  Base        PreMeetingUIMgr::sig_sslCertWarningChanged()
</code></pre><p>Those look like callbacks that get invoked when a certificate is invalid, and Zoom does indeed show a warning if you try to intercept its traffic with a tool like <code>mitmproxy</code>. The callbacks deal with certificates, not unencrypted buffers, so they are not useful to us.</p><p>Looking at the output of <code>ldd</code> we can see that Zoom links to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtnetwork-index.html">Qt Network</a>, which includes some potentially relevant APIs:</p><pre><code><span>$ objdump -CT /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -iE "QNetworkReq"
</span>0000000000000000      DF *UND*	0000000000000000  Qt_5        QNetworkRequest::QNetworkRequest(QUrl const&amp;)
<!-- -->0000000000000000      DF *UND*	0000000000000000  Qt_5        QNetworkRequest::~QNetworkRequest()
<!-- -->0000000000000000      DF *UND*	0000000000000000  Qt_5        QNetworkAccessManager::get(QNetworkRequest const&amp;)
</code></pre><p><code>QNetworkRequest(QUrl const&amp;)</code> looks like something that could be used to communicate with the backend and does <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qnetworkrequest.html#setSslConfiguration">support TLS</a>. I tried attaching to it and other functions exported by the framework but none of them turned out to be invoked. Zoom supports a number of platforms and devices, it's possible that they use Qt just for the UI on linux, and then have some lower level networking code that can be shared with their other clients.</p><p>At this point it is pretty likely that zoom is linking statically to the TLS library. Let's see if in the <code>.rodata</code> section of the binary there's anything that could point us in the right direction:</p><pre><code><span>$ readelf -p .rodata /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -i ssl | wc -l
</span>739
<!-- -->$ # 😏
<!-- -->$ readelf -p .rodata /opt/zoom/zoom | grep -i 'openssl 1'
<!-- -->  [4a1b66]  OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020
<!-- -->  [58cd50]  OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020
</code></pre><p>Aha! The client is using OpenSSL version 1.1.1g (knowing this will turn out to be very useful), and the library is statically linked.</p><h2>Instrumenting OpenSSL</h2><p>OpenSSL exports two functions named <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_read.html">SSL_read</a> and <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_write.html">SSL_write</a>, which have the following signature:</p><pre><code><span>int</span><span> </span><span>SSL_read</span><span>(</span><span>SSL </span><span>*</span><span>ssl</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> num</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>

Attaching an uprobe where <code>SSL_read</code> <em>returns</em>, and one at the <em>entry</em> of <code>SSL_write</code>, we can therefore access unencrypted memory.</p><p>Here's the uprobes that do just that:</p><pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>redbpf_probes</span><span>::</span><span>uprobe</span><span>::</span><span>prelude</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span><span>

Once they are triggered, they get passed a <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/kprobe/struct.Registers.html">Registers</a> argument through which they can access memory.</p><p>The <code>SSL_write_entry</code> probe is the simplest. It reads the registers containing the values of the <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_write</code>, and sends a copy of the buffer to user-space before it gets encrypted.</p><p>The <code>SSL_read_entry</code> probe is similar in that it reads the content of the <code>ssl</code>, <code>buf</code> and <code>num</code> arguments passed to <code>SSL_read</code>. It doesn't send the buffer to user-space though. Remember the data is decrypted <em>after</em> <code>SSL_read</code> returns, so we need a second uprobe that we attach to the <em>return address</em> of the function. That's what <code>SSL_read_ret</code> is for. It's similar to the other two probes, but is annotated with <a href="https://ingraind.org/api/redbpf_probes/uprobe/prelude/attr.uretprobe.html">#[uretprobe]</a>, which means that it will trigger once the function it's attached to <em>returns</em>.</p><p>But why do we need two probes for <code>SSL_read</code>, why not just have <code>SSL_read_ret</code>? The answer is that when <code>SSL_read</code> returns, it's likely that the registers that used to contain the function arguments were modified, so we need to read their values at the start of the function and store them so we can retrieve them later. This is a very common pattern when writing BPF code.</p><p>Finally if zoom linked to OpenSSL dynamically or if debugging symbols were present, the user-space code to attach the probes would be as simple as:</p><pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>redbpf</span><span>::</span><span>load</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>;</span><span>

September 10, 2020 | https://solitaired.com/email-registration-is-dead | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solitaired.com/email-registration-is-dead">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/coverimage.png"></center><p>
In our last business, where we ran popular educational products like EasyBib, we learned the power of email registration. When users registered we found that they would come back and use our service more, and eventually subscribe. </p>
<h2 id="firststeptoimproveretentionaddregistration">First step to improve retention: Add registration</h2>
<p>When building our <a href="https://solitaired.com/">solitaire site</a> then, a fun side hobby of ours, adding in email registration and account creation was immediately on our roadmap. When we added the ability to create accounts and track past scores, we immediately saw that our sessions per user increased by 5%. It was a solid win!</p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/fivelift.png"></center>
<p>To encourage more registrations we introduced a leaderboard to see how you performed against other players. You could see how your time and number of moves compared to others who played the same game, and we encouraged sign ups to get your name on the leaderboard. This improved registrations by 22%, and we saw sessions per user increase another 3%. </p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/threelift.png"></center>
<p>All these features encouraged users to play more, compete against themselves and others, and return to the site.</p>
<h2 id="dosendingemailsmoveourkpis">Do sending emails move our KPIs?</h2>
<p>By now, we had learned that registration was a powerful feature in our game to drive loyalty and retention. Given that we were collecting emails as part of our standard registration process, we naturally thought emailing our user base, which had reached over 15,000 users, could naturally drive more return usage. </p>
<p>We started emailing our users to play a new game of the day feature we introduced. Open rates were a solid 17% on average, but click through rates to the game were 1%. This meant it drove about 26 more users to our site (15,000 * 17% * 1%). Moreover, these could have been users who would have gone back to Solitaired whether they read our email or not. </p>
<p>We saw a 0.5% improvement in returning users, but when we stopped sending emails, this didnâ€™t change suggesting the modest improvement was just noise.</p>
<h2 id="removingemailregistration">Removing email registration</h2>
<p>While registration, saving accounts, and leaderboards improved retention, sending emails clearly did not. </p>
<p>I was watching my sister play, who had become a solitaire addict after she QAing the game. She was obsessed with beating her personal bests and getting high scores for the game of the day. When I watched her play though, quizzically, she had not registered for an account. </p>
<p>I asked her why, she said she just didnâ€™t want to give her email away and get bombarded by more emails. I was dumbfounded, because after all, her brother (me), was the co-founder of the site and yet she still had these concerns.</p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/sister.png"></center>
<p>The lightbulb went off. Since sending emails did not provide value, and if anything was an additional cost,  what if we just asked for a username. While this creates issues with password recovery, we thought this would drive up registrations and improve retention. We also have a long term cookie so users wouldnâ€™t have to login again. </p>
<p>When we changed email sign ups simply to usernames, we saw registrations increase by a huge 36%! More importantly, we saw return users increase another 4.5%.</p>
<p>This meant email registration was holding us back from driving retention. </p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/fourfivelift.png"></center>
<p>Digging in further, we're also seeing return visitors playing more games like <a href="https://solitaired.com/freecell">Freecell</a> and <a href="https://solitaired.com/spider">Spider</a>. Leaderboards and simple registration have encouraged users to try new games.</p>
<h2 id="weassumeemailisvaluable">We assume email is valuable</h2>
<p>Depending on your site and space, email surely can be valuable. For ecommerce sites, you can send targeted emails with special offers, for example. </p>
<p>Most of us assume email is beneficial to our businesses, and we rarely test to see if thatâ€™s the case. We have it because it gives us an owned channel to reach out and engage our users whenever we want. </p>
<p>However, we're forgetting a key fact: most of us also hate emails from commercial sites. They clog our inbox, and we instinctually either ignore or delete them. Every once in a while we might open one of those emails up, and even more rarely, we might click the call to action in the email. </p>
<p>Ask if requiring email addresses really moves important business metrics for your site. Sometimes they do. In our case, it just created a poor user experience which weâ€™re now happy to be rid of.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
This is the blog version of a talk I gave on the 2017-12-13 at the Athens
Clojure Meetup, which was kindly hosted by <a href="https://engineering.skroutz.gr/">Skroutz</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1qpIaB6_vM">The video of the talk</a> is
available (the talk was given in Greek, but there are English subtitles). This
blog entry is not an exact transcript of the talk, I've added links and more
information where appropriate (plus the "bonus" sections that were not in the
talk). Since the talk was given a while ago, some information will be outdated.
</p>

<p>
There are essentially two parts to this article: the "what it is" part which
introduces the basic concepts and mechanisms of spec, and also provides some
information so that non-Clojurians can see how spec fits into the larger picture
and the "what you can do with it" part which explores some more interesting use
cases that go beyond basic usage.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge99096d">
<h2 id="orge99096d">What is it?</h2>
<div id="text-orge99096d">
<p>
Clojure is a dynamic language that doesn't enforce the types of parameters or
the return values of functions. This has been a characteristic of the language
that has drawn criticism both internally and from other language communities and
has possibly been a factor impeding adoption in the past.
</p>

<p>
Spec in a way is the response to that, but it's a response that maybe the
community didn't expect because it does not take the traditional approach of
checking types statically. At a very fundamental level spec is a declarative
language that describes data, their type, their shape. Spec follows the general
philosophy of Clojure in that all of its functionality is available at runtime,
you can use it, introspect it, generate it – there is no extra step before
execution when the compiler checks your whole codebase for errors.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org56f06dc">
<h3 id="org56f06dc">What does it look like?</h3>
<div id="text-org56f06dc">
<p>
Spec is still alpha, so the namespace in the <code>require</code> contains <code>.alpha</code> to indicate
that. The following spec defines a <code>username</code> "entity" and says that it has to be
a string:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require '[clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s])

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>string?</code> is a simple function that exists in Clojure core, it's a
predicate function that you pass a string to and it returns <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>, depending on whether the passed value is a string or not.
</p>

<p>
Once you've defined a spec the simplest usage of it is to ask whether
something is valid, by calling <code>valid?</code>, and passing the name of the
spec and then a value:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid? <span>::username</span> <span>"foo"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>true
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfa7c72e">
<h3 id="orgfa7c72e">It's just predicates!</h3>
<div id="text-orgfa7c72e">
<p>
Many cases are covered by built-in predicates, but that doesn't mean
we can't use our own. If we need a spec that checks that a number is
above 5, we can simply write an anonymous function like this one,
and then use it normally as it if was a spec itself:
</p>



<pre>true
</pre>


<p>
And it works as expected with different inputs:
</p>



<pre>false
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6c5c14c">
<h3 id="org6c5c14c">Validate data</h3>
<div id="text-org6c5c14c">
<p>
So, we write a spec and it can validate our data. Let's draw this as a
diagram: the thing on the left that looks like a blueprint is a spec and the
curly braces on the right represents Clojure data (because very often data in
Clojure are maps and maps are written with curly braces). Read the weird arrow
in the middle as "validates":
</p>


<p><img src="https://www.pixelated-noise.com/blog/2020/09/10/what-spec-is/validate-data.png" alt="validate-data.png">
</p>

<p>
It's not much of a diagram, but I'm trying to establish the visual language
for the rest of this article.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgea7799a">
<h3 id="orgea7799a">Collections specs</h3>
<div id="text-orgea7799a">
<p>
Specs can also be applied to collections by composing and nesting
more basic specs together. Here we define an entity called <code>usernames</code>
made up of a collection of <code>username</code>:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require '[clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s])

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::usernames</span> (<span>s</span>/coll-of <span>::username</span>))

(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid? <span>::usernames</span> [<span>"foo"</span> <span>"bar"</span> <span>"baz"</span>]))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>true
</pre>


<p>
You would normally not define this as a separate entity for something that
simple, as <code>s/coll-of</code> can be used ad-hoc in your program.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org81b3460">
<h3 id="org81b3460">Maps</h3>
<div id="text-org81b3460">
<p>
Maps are a bit more interesting. Other technologies such as <a href="https://github.com/plumatic/schema">plumatic
schema</a> (which at some point was the de facto way to validate data in
Clojure), ask you to define both the keys that have to be present in
a map and the data types of the values that correspond to the
keys. The resulting definition looks a bit like a rigidly-defined
class that you usually see in object-oriented languages. Spec very
deliberately moves away from this mentality: the maps are <b>not</b> like
objects, they are <b>not</b> fixed and do not necessarily exist in that one
shape. Instead, maps simply happen to be aggregations of some named
values.
</p>

<p>
This design decision is embodied in two ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A map spec written using <code>s/keys</code> which does not define the types of
the values of the map, we only define which existing entities make
up the map.</li>

<li>The name of the key inside the map has to be the same as the name
of the spec already defined elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this case we have defined some single-value specs like username,
password, last-login and comment, and they are aggregated together
in a map defined by the <code>::user</code> spec.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>ns</span> <span>my-project.users</span>
  (<span>:require</span> [clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s]))

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::password</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::last-login</span> number?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::comment</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::user</span>
  (<span>s</span>/keys
   <span>:req</span> [<span>::username</span> <span>::password</span>]
   <span>:opt</span> [<span>::comment</span> <span>::last-login</span>]))

(println <span>::username</span>)

(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid?

   <span>::last-login</span> 11000}))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>:my-project.users/username ;;this is what fully-qualified keywords look like
true
</pre>


<p>
Spec also encourages the use of qualified keywords: Until recently
in Clojure people would use keywords with a single colon but the two
colons (<code>::</code>) mean that keywords belong to this namespace, in this
case <code>my-project.users</code>. This is another deliberate choice, which is
about creating strong names (or "fully-qualified"), that belong to a
particular namespace, so that we can mix namespaces within the same
map. This means that we can have a map that comes from outside our
system and has its own namespace, and then we add more keys to this
map that belong to our own company's namespace without having to
worry about name clashes. This also helps with data provenance,
because you know that the <code>:subsystem-a/id</code> field is not simply an ID
– it's an ID that was assigned by subsystem-a.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3248f46">
<h3 id="org3248f46">Maps are open</h3>
<div id="text-org3248f46">
<p>
The other interesting thing about specs for maps is that they are
open. For example, if we use the same exact map as before, with the
same fields and an additional field called <code>::age</code>, it's still a valid
<code>::user</code>:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>ns</span> <span>my-project.users</span>
  (<span>:require</span> [clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s]))

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::password</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::last-login</span> number?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::comment</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::user</span>
  (<span>s</span>/keys
   <span>:req</span> [<span>::username</span> <span>::password</span>]
   <span>:opt</span> [<span>::comment</span> <span>::last-login</span>]))

(println
 (<span>s</span>/valid?
  <span>::user</span>
  {<span>::username</span>   <span>"rich"</span>
   <span>::password</span>   <span>"zegure"</span>
   <span>::comment</span>    <span>"this is a user"</span>
   <span>::last-login</span> 11000
   <span>::age</span>        26}))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>true
</pre>


<p>
This happens because spec does not mind if you've defined four keys, if it
sees a fifth key the map does not become invalid. The reason for this is that
when we have a system that accumulates information this accumulation should
not break the system, the code that consumes the map should simply ignore the
keys it doesn't know about. If you're making a system and you're accumulating
extra options, parameters, whatever it is – your code should be able to
continue to run without having to change a lot of code locations, like you
would have to do in an object oriented language or Haskell.
</p>

<p>
This accumulation has also been described by the term "accretion"
and has been discussed in the excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk">Spec-ulation Keynote talk</a> by
Rich Hickey.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a lot of people who use spec to validate things coming from
outside their system need to be more strict with maps, and they have
complained about the openness of maps. We'll talk about proposed solutions to
this issue later.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0b68930">
<h3 id="org0b68930">Explain your problems</h3>
<div id="text-org0b68930">
<p>
Another usage of specs, beyond validation, is "explain" which
essentially can produce errors that tell you what's wrong with your
data. In this case we'll try to create an error by creating a user
that's invalid because it doesn't have a password – a required key:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>ns</span> <span>my-project.users</span>
  (<span>:require</span> [clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s]))

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::username</span> string?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::password</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::last-login</span> number?)
(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::comment</span> string?)

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::user</span>
  (<span>s</span>/keys
   <span>:req</span> [<span>::username</span> <span>::password</span>]
   <span>:opt</span> [<span>::comment</span> <span>::last-login</span>]))

(<span>s</span>/explain
 <span>::user</span>
 {<span>::username</span>   <span>"rich"</span>
  <span>::comment</span>    <span>"this is a user"</span>})
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We get an ok-ish error that tells us that for the particular map we
passed, the <code>::user</code> spec fails because it doesn't contain <code>::password</code>.
</p>

<pre>val: #:my-project.users{:username "rich", :comment "this is a user"} fails spec: :my-project.users/user predicate: (contains? % :my-project.users/password)
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb0d0b9f">
<h3 id="orgb0d0b9f">Sequence specs - regular expressions for data</h3>
<div id="text-orgb0d0b9f">
<p>
A powerful mechanism in spec is sequences. We've already seen <code>s/coll-of</code> which
contains a uniform type of values (a collection of numbers for example) but
sequences are a bit more like regular expressions for data. In this case we
have a sequence with two things, which describe an ingredient for a recipe:
the first thing is a number for the quantity and the second thing is a unit
encoded as a keyword.
</p>

<div>
<pre>(require '[clojure.spec.alpha <span>:as</span> s])

(<span>s</span>/<span>def</span> <span>::ingredient</span> (<span>s</span>/cat <span>:quantity</span> number? <span>:unit</span> keyword?))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With <code>s/cat</code> we always have to give a name to each position. <code>s/cat</code>
allows to both validate the shape of the value passed, but it also
enables the "conform" operation, which is somehow similar to parsing
or destructuring. If we pass a vector of two elements – a number and
a keyword –  we get back a map with the defined names:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(prn (<span>s</span>/conform <span>::ingredient</span> [2 <span>:teaspoon</span>]))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>{:quantity 2, :unit :teaspoon}
</pre>


<p>
By using some of the other operators which are reminiscent of regular
expressions, this technique can become quite …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Am <strong>10. September 2020</strong> haben in ganz Deutschland Warn-Apps gepiept, Sirenen geheult, Rundfunkanstalten ihre Sendungen unterbrochen und Probewarnungen sind auf digitalen Werbetafeln erschienen. An diesem Tag fand der erste bundesweite Warntag seit der Wiedervereinigung statt. Ab diesem Jahr wird ein bundesweiter Warntag jährlich am <strong>zweiten Donnerstag im September</strong> stattfinden.</p><p>Zur Warnung der Bevölkerung nutzen Bund, Länder und Kommunen alle verfügbaren Kommunikationskanäle: so etwa das vom Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe (<abbr title="Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe">BBK</abbr>) betriebene <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/DE/AufgabenundAusstattung/Krisenmanagement/WarnungderBevoelkerung/MoWaS/ModularesWarnsystem_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Modulares Warnsystem (Öffnet&nbsp;neues&nbsp;Fenster)">Modulare Warnsystem</a> und die <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/DE/NINA/Warn-App_NINA_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Warn-App NINA (Öffnet&nbsp;neues&nbsp;Fenster)">Warn-<abbr title="Applikation – Anwendungsprogramm">App</abbr> <abbr title="Notfall-Informations- und Nachrichten-App">NINA</abbr></a>, eine Vielzahl von Medien und Rundfunksendern bis hin zu Sirenen und Lautsprecherdurchsagen vor Ort. </p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.bbk.bund.de/SharedDocs/Bilder/BBK/DE/Bilder_aktuelle_Meldungen/2020/Warntag_Graphik.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;v=2" title="Warntag 2020 - eine graphische Darstellung" alt="Warntag 2020 - eine graphische Darstellung"></span>
</p>

<p>Mithilfe des Modularen Warnsystems wird eine Probewarnung an alle daran angeschlossenen Warnmultiplikatoren versendet. Warnmultiplikatoren sind ein Adressatenkreis, der Warnmeldungen weitergibt. Hierbei kann es sich <acronym title="zum Beispiel">z. B.</acronym> um einen Radio- oder Fernsehsender handeln, der seine laufende Sendung unterbricht und die Meldung verliest <abbr title="beziehungsweise">bzw.</abbr> einen Crawler (Lauftext) in die laufende Fernsehsendung einblendet, oder eine Leitstelle, die ihre Sirenen auslöst.</p>

<p>Diese Warnmultiplikatoren leiten die Probewarnung an die Endgeräte wie zum Beispiel Radios oder die Warn-<abbr title="Applikation – Anwendungsprogramm">App</abbr> <abbr title="Notfall-Informations- und Nachrichten-App">NINA</abbr> und damit direkt an die Bürgerinnen und Bürger weiter. Zeitgleich werden auf Ebene der Länder, in den Landkreisen und in den Kommunen außerdem weitere verfügbare kommunale Warnmittel ausgelöst, zu denen beispielsweise Sirenen und Lautsprecherwagen zählen können. Auf denselben Wegen wird dann um 11.20 Uhr das allgemeine Signal zur Entwarnung erfolgen.</p>
<h3>Vom Sofa aus ins Bundesamt schauen</h3>

<p>Das <abbr title="Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe">BBK</abbr> hat im Bund die Aufgabe der Warnung der Bevölkerung vor den besonderen Gefahren eines Verteidigungsfalls und beteiligt sich ebenfalls am Warntag 2020. Wovor und wie das Amt dabei genau warnen kann, darüber hat das <abbr title="Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe">BBK</abbr> bereits vorab bei einem virtuellen Tag der offenen Tür informiert – und sich dabei den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern als zuständige Bundesoberbehörde gleich selbst vorgestellt.</p>

<p>In den folgenden drei Gesprächen erfahren Sie mehr über die Aufgabe der Warnung der Bevölkerung, die Warnapp <abbr title="Notfall-Informations- und Nachrichten-App">NINA</abbr> und den bundesweiten Warntag. Die Videos sind auch in Deutsche Gebärdensprache übersetzt.</p>

<p>Auf Grundlage eines Beschlusses der Innenministerkonferenz wird der bundesweite Warntag ab dem Jahr 2020 jährlich an jedem zweiten Donnerstag im September stattfinden. Er soll dazu beitragen, die Akzeptanz und das Wissen um die Warnung der Bevölkerung in Notlagen zu erhöhen und damit deren Selbstschutzfertigkeiten zu stärken. Die Wichtigkeit und Aktualität des Themas Warnung zeigt sich auch durch die Entwicklungen im Zusammenhang mit dem <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/DE/AktuellesundPresse/Informationen_zu_SARS-CoV-2/Corona_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Informationen zu SARS-CoV-2 (Öffnet&nbsp;neues&nbsp;Fenster)">Corona-Virus</a> in diesem Jahr. Zur Warnung und Information der Bevölkerung nutzen Bund, Länder und Kommunen die verfügbaren Kommunikationskanäle. So werden beispielsweise über das vom <abbr title="Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe">BBK</abbr> betriebene <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/DE/AufgabenundAusstattung/Krisenmanagement/WarnungderBevoelkerung/MoWaS/ModularesWarnsystem_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Modulares Warnsystem (Öffnet&nbsp;neues&nbsp;Fenster)">Modulare Warnsystem</a> und die <a href="https://www.bbk.bund.de/DE/NINA/Warn-App_NINA_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Warn-App NINA (Öffnet&nbsp;neues&nbsp;Fenster)">Warn-<abbr title="Applikation – Anwendungsprogramm">App</abbr> <abbr title="Notfall-Informations- und Nachrichten-App">NINA</abbr></a> Warnungen und Informationen der zuständigen Behörden, wie der Gesundheitsministerien des Bundes und der Länder, bereitgestellt. Bund und Länder bereiten den bundesweiten Warntag in Abstimmung mit kommunalen Vertretern gemeinsam vor. Zuständig sind auf Bundesebene das <abbr title="Bundesamt für Bevölkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe">BBK</abbr>, auf der Ebene der Länder die jeweiligen Innenministerien und auf der Ebene der Kommunen in der Regel die für den Katastrophenschutz zuständigen Behörden.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><time datetime="2020-09-10">10 Sep 2020</time></header><p>Physicists are often bothered by the question “why do fundamental physical constants have the values they do?” Sometimes this concern can be answered by “well it had to take <em>some</em> value”, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning">but not always</a>. Seeking explanations for patterns in what appear to be fundamental constants is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">historically</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_(physics)">successful</a> way to probe for the next undiscovered piece of physics.</p><p>The anthropic principle attempts to answer that sort of question. Crudely, an anthropic argument is one taking the form:</p><blockquote><p>The universe is the way it is because if it weren’t, we wouldn’t be here to discuss the issue.</p></blockquote><p>It shouldn’t surprise you to learn that most physicists are, at the very least, a little uncomfortable with this form of argument. The best pro-anthropic-argument summary I know of is frequently given by Nima Arkani-Hamed. Unfortunately I cannot find a video, so my own thoroughly inferior retelling will have to do:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose you walk into a room and see a table. On the table is a pencil, balanced perfectly on its tip. This is unlikely, to say the least. It needs explanation. The first thing to do is look for a string holding it up, or some glue on the tip, or the like. You check, and there’s no such mechanism. The next thing to do is look around — are there thousands of other pencils, lying normally on the table and the floor? If so, then the balancing pencil may reasonably be called coincidence. Alas, there are none.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There’s one last thing to do, to explain the magic pencil: look under the table. Is there a bomb, rigged to explode the moment the pencil falls over? Step outside: do you see the remains of thousands of detonated houses? If so, then it may be correct to say “the pencil was standing because, were it any other way, we would not have been in that room”.</p></blockquote><p>That last check is what an anthropic argument is all about. We can’t actually look for other rooms, destroyed by bombs (that would be called “the multiverse”), but we can at least try and look for the bomb.</p><p>The problem is, what qualifies as a bomb? The canonical example: if the cosmological constant were larger by a factor of say, $10^{100}$, the universe would have promptly blown itself apart. I wouldn’t be here to write this, you wouldn’t be here to read it. Surely we should not be surprised that the cosmological constant is not, in fact, so large.</p><p>Does that still make you uncomfortable? Perhaps it should. This type of argument is very slippery (like a slope). Thinking along the lines of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly effect</a>, it’s clear that even a one-part-in-$10^{10}$ change in the fine structure constant would build up dramatic differences in the evolution and course of life on Earth. In this universe, where $\alpha \approx 0.007297352569$, you’re reading an article about the anthropic principle; in the universe where $\alpha \approx 0.007297352570$, at the very least, it’s reasonable to guess that you would not be. (Good news: in that universe, you’re a billionaire playboy philanthropist!) Does this explain (to high precision) the value of the fine structure constant? After all, were the fine structure constant different by even $10^{-10}$, you would not be considering the question.</p><p>This has the basic structure of an anthropic argument, but there’s clearly something wrong with it. In that alternate universe, there are other people who <em>are</em> considering the question “why does $\alpha$ have that value?” The puzzle would still exist, even if you and I specifically have no interest.</p><p>Let’s consider, then, a universe where $\alpha$ is different by a full one part in a million. Chemical and nuclear physics don’t look substantially different, but again, the butterfly effect suggests that we should expect large differences in the situation on Earth. Suppose intelligent life exists on Earth, but not in anything remotely resembling human form. Now, it’s true that “there are no humans considering the question”. But again, there are <em>beings</em> on this planet considering the question. Shouldn’t that be enough?</p><p>Suppose $\alpha$ were different by one part in one hundred thousand. Now there’s no intelligent life on Earth at all — instead, intelligent life (tripedal, if you were wondering) evolves on Alpha Centauri! Questions of fine tuning are not considered anywhere in our solar system, but there are intelligent beings in the galaxy considering the question. It’s entirely accurate to say “were $\alpha$ different by one part in $10^5$, we would not be here to discuss these questions”, but <em>someone</em> would be <em>somewhere</em>, so that doesn’t seem like much of an explanation.</p><p>As far as I can tell, the best prototype for a good anthropic argument is:</p><blockquote><p>You have asked why proposition $P$ (which you find <em>a priori</em> surprising) should be true in our universe. You are able to ask this question in part because $P$ is true. Were $P$ false, you would not be able to ask such a question. In fact, were $P$ false, intelligent beings would not exist at all. Therefore, questions such as “why $P$” or “why not $P$” would never be expressed. Since questions like “what should be my prior probability of $P$” require $P$ to be true in order to be asked, the answer can only be “your prior should be near $1$”. Therefore $P$ is not, in fact, <em>a priori</em> surprising.</p></blockquote><p>The problem is, this anthropic principle is <em>extremely weak</em>. One proposed use of the anthropic principle is to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1749-6632.2001.tb02133.x">explain the fine structure constant</a>. Suppose the fine structure constant were in fact 10% different — enough to prevent stellar fusion from producing carbon. This would prevent carbon-based life from existing, sure; but would it prevent <em>intelligent</em> life from existing? Perhaps the question “why is $\alpha$ that particular value” could still be asked! It’s hard to know, without an unprecedentedly high-fidelity simulation of an alternate universe with $\alpha = 0.01$. That simulation isn’t coming soon.</p><p>The book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_Egg">Dragon’s Egg</a> is based around intelligent life living in the crust of a neutron star. The existence of such life certainly can’t be ruled out with our current understanding of the physics of dense matter. That’s a <em>very different</em> environment than our own; for starters, the strong surface gravity and magnetic field deform atoms by as much as a substantial change to the fine structure constant. If the anthropic principle can’t “explain why” we don’t live on the surface of a neutron star, then it certainly can’t account for a few percentage points in the fine structure constant.</p><p>This isn’t just yet another case of “we suck at creating efficient first-principles simulations”, either. One of the most famous stylized facts about <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html">cellular automata</a> is that if you sneeze at them, they <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniversalCellularAutomaton.html">become Turing-complete</a>. (This isn’t really a special fact about cellular automata, just a reflection of the fact that systems that support complex dynamics tend to also support universal computation.) A Turing-complete cellular automaton can simulate any classical process, and therefore displays phenomena like self-reproducing organisms. Moreover, a Turing-complete cellular automaton can support any intelligence exhibited by a computer. In principle (although of course this is too expensive to have been directly demonstrated) a cellular automaton like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s</a>, beginning from a random position, ought to eventually evolve various levels of intelligence — intelligence is evolutionarily favorable in our world, and ought to be in others as well. So, shouldn’t such automata be capable of asking <em>the question</em>?</p><p>(In the case of Conway’s game, I guess <em>the question</em> is “why is the grid rectangular instead of hexagonal?")</p><p>The framework of modern fundamental physics is slightly more complicated than “it’s a cellular automaton” (this is <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">only slightly controversial</a>), but the intuition gained from cellular automata is sticky: even large modifications to physical laws shouldn’t prevent intelligent structures from forming. This is the fundamental weakness of anthropic arguments. A properly formed anthropic argument should be based on an inability for intelligence to form, but intelligence is quite resilient. Almost any non-trivial universe can support intelligent life which will, inevitably, ask <em>the question</em>.</p><p>In a few cases, this issue may be circumvented: if the cosmological constant was too small/large, the universe would have collapsed/blown itself to smithereens before having a chance to develop anything resembling intelligence. This is largely independent of the other physical laws. That requirement is not strong enough to remove fine-tuning issues with the cosmological constant, and it certainly provides nothing resembling an explanation for the fine structure constant or any other part of the standard model.</p><p>I don’t think this weakness is repairable. Intelligent life is “existentially resilient”. The particular fundamental constants that describe the universe are unlikely to be the only ones that would allow someone to complain about fine-tuning and speculate about anthropic arguments.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1. Heading 3 sits within heading 2 and so on." width="1958" height="1236" srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1958px) 100vw, 1958px" data-srcset="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg 1958w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-300x189.jpg 300w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-768x485.jpg 768w, https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x-1536x970.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://bighack.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A physicist loses half the value of their physics knowledge in just four years whereas
an English professor would take over 25 years to lose half the value of the
knowledge they had at the beginning of their career [1]. These estimates are
taken form a paper written in 1982 so software engineers obviously weren’t
included. But it begs the question… What would the half-life of the value of a
software engineer’s knowledge be? I suspect it’s somewhere between the physicist’s
and the English professor’s because a software engineer’s knowledge is a combination
of eternal computer science/engineering principles and ephemeral technologies that
drift in and out of popularity over time.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-that-doesnt-expire">Knowledge that doesn’t expire</h2>
<p>Software engineers with a traditional computer science background learn things
that never expire with age: data structures, algorithms, compilers,
distributed systems, etc. But most of us don’t work with these concepts
directly. Abstractions and frameworks are built on top of these well studied
ideas so we don’t have to get into the nitty-gritty details on the job
(at least most of the time). Examples are the C++ standard library which
implements optimized sorting for arrays, and Apache Spark which provides fault
tolerant cluster computing out of the box.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-that-does-expire">Knowledge that does expire</h2>
<p>The unavoidable ephemeral knowledge one accumulates during their career comes in
many forms and this isn’t an exhaustive list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A vogue framework or programming paradigm that falls out of favor in a couple of years.</li>
  <li>Domain knowledge in a rapidly evolving industry/field.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of proprietry technology: e.g. internal tools at your company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowledge of this kind can quickly transition from zealous adoption to every company who
uses said knowledge trying to sunset everything they’ve built with it.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>I’m inclined to say I use ephemeral knowledge more than eternal knowledge to perform
my job. And then there’s the added pressure in our industry of always having to learn
new and useful things.</p>

<p>A theoretical physicist who spends a great deal of time mastering a theory and
the mathematical techniques behind it, only to see that theory rendered obsolete
by a new and improved theory several years later, is analogous to a software
engineer who spends a great deal of time mastering a web development framework,
learning its intricacies and gotcha’s, only to see that framework rendered
obsolete by a new framework several years later, leaving no more demand for
that knowledge in the labor market.</p>

<p>I relate to the physicist more than the English professor. What do you think?</p>

Since its inception back at the start of the century, the demand for this medium-sized, energy and space-efficient, the memory storage device has been growing at a fast rate. Therefore, to meet the market requirements, the SDA was set up as a non-profit organization to promote and create SD Card standards. There are various topics related to the SD card such as the different device families, speed classes, smart cards, card security and so on and it is used in various markets like digital cameras, personal computers, and embedded systems. Some of the standard variations include SD, SDHC, SDXC, SD-ultra high speed etc. The microSD is the miniaturized SD memory card format with a small form factor and is widely used in various electronic devices.<br>
What we are going to learn is the use of SD cards in an embedded system. To be specific, we will be dealing with the use of SD cards in small embedded systems.</p><h2>Circuit&nbsp;and Interfacing</h2><p>SD card has a native host interface apart from the SPI mode for communicating with master devices. The native interface uses four lines for data transfer where the microcontroller has SD card controller module and it needs separate license to use it. Since the SPI is a widely used protocol and it is available in most low-cost microcontrollers, the SPI mode is the widely used interface in low cost embedded systems. The working voltage range of SD family is 2.7V to 3.6V and this is indicated in the operation condition register (OCR).</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2000px-SD_Pins.svg_-1.png" alt="2000px-sd_pins-svg" width="214" height="292"></p><div id="attachment_2345"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2345" src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card.png" alt="sd-card" width="371" height="229" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-200x124.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-300x185.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-400x247.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-600x371.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-768x475.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-800x495.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"><p id="caption-attachment-2345">SD Card pinout</p></div><div id="attachment_2347"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2347" src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2.png" alt="sd-card-2" width="381" height="213" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-200x112.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-300x168.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-400x223.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-600x335.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-768x429.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2-800x447.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-2.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px"><p id="caption-attachment-2347">MicroSD Card pinout</p></div><p>Most micro-controllers use the SPI communication protocol to interface with the SD cards. The SD cards have a microcontroller that shows their availability to the master controller(microcontroller). The micro-controller sees the SD card as an addressable sector on which read/write functions are possible. Once the microcontroller is in the SPI mode, communication between the master and the slave is done via 4 pins viz. clock, chip select, data in and data out. It should be kept in mind that throughout the communication between the two devices, the micro-controller will be sending out the clock.<br>
Most development boards have a dedicated SD card slot. But to understand the connections, let us analyze this fairly simple circuit.</p><div id="openl-1640581475"><div data-animationoffset="100%"><div><div data-link="https://openlabpro.com/online-courses/pic-microcontroller/" data-link-target="_self" data-animationoffset="100%"><div>From the very basic I/O control to the advaced SD Card interfacing, this course covers what you need to get started in Embedded Systems.<div><div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/362065141?autoplay=0&amp;autopause=0" width="600" height="360" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo362065141" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"></iframe></div></div></div><a href="https://openlabpro.com/online-courses/pic-microcontroller/" target="_self">Learn more about the course</a></div></div></div></div><h3>Circuit</h3><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit.png" alt="sd-card-circuit" width="506" height="284" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-200x113.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-300x169.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-400x225.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-600x338.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-768x432.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-800x450.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-1024x576.png 1024w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit-1200x675.png 1200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-circuit.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px"></p><p>If the logic level of the microcontroller is different than the SD card, level shifter needs to be used for converting the line voltages.<br>
The MISO (master in serial out) pin should be connected to the SDI (serial data in) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The MOSI (master out serial in) pin should be connected to the SDO (serial data out) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The SCK (serial clock) pin should be connected to the SCK (serial clock) pin on the microcontroller.<br>
The CS (chip select) pin should be connected to the corresponding CS pin on the microcontroller or on any digital I/O pin on the microcontroller. A common ground is provided.</p><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: While connecting the power supply, make sure that the supply is drawn from a 3.3V supply as a 5V supply would see your card go up in smoke.</p><h3>Interfacing</h3><p>Once the connections are set up, we are ready to interface our hardware with the software.<br>
Set the directions of each of the four pins correctly. While activating the SPI mode, an ideal configuration should be, mode(0,0) and the phase with input sampled at the middle of data out. Also, the clock frequency should be set in the range of 100 kHz and 400 kHz prior to initializing the card. Once the initialization is done, the clock can be set to a more desired frequency.</p><h2>SD Commands</h2><p>Next comes the tricky part, initializing the SD card and performing the raw data communication. A systematic approach to programming the software would make the task pretty easy.<br>
But first, it is important to learn how the micro-controller activates the SD card. There are a fixed set of commands and responses, which must be followed to create a command to response structure in our program. The data is transmitted in a byte-oriented format with a definite length.<br>
The following table shows the necessary<b> commands</b> to the card and the corresponding response from the card.</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3.png" alt="sd-card-3" width="507" height="1118" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-136x300.png 136w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-200x441.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-400x882.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-464x1024.png 464w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-600x1323.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-768x1694.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-800x1765.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3-1200x2647.png 1200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SD-card-3.png 1274w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></p><p>Every command has a constant length of 6 bytes.<br>
The first byte is the addition of the command number and the number 64.<br>
<b>Example</b>:<br>
For CMD0: command number 0 + 64 = 64 = 0x40 in hexadecimal.<br>
For CMD1: command number 1 + 64 = 65 = 0x41 in hexadecimal.<br>
And so on.<br>
This is followed by a set of four bytes which are known as the arguments. These arguments usually contain the address of a data or the length of a block.<br>
The last byte is the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) Byte. Most commands in the SPI mode does not require a check byte if the CRC feature isn’t enabled. For some commands like CMD0, the CRC is 0x95 and in most cases, a 0xFF is sent. Enabling the CRC requires you to send the correct check byte from the micro-controller. So, ensure whether the CRC feature is enabled or disabled.<br>
A <b>command frame</b> looks like this-</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-800x267.png" alt="Interfacing Microcontrollers with SD Card - Command frame" width="800" height="267" srcset="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-200x67.png 200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-300x100.png 300w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-400x133.png 400w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-600x200.png 600w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-768x256.png 768w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-800x267.png 800w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-1024x342.png 1024w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1-1200x400.png 1200w, https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clr_frame1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p><p>The card will receive a command when the DO pin (Data Out) is driven high as shown above. The CS pin (Chip Select) must be driven high to low before sending the command and must be kept low during the process. The time between a command and its response is known as the command response time (NCR). As mentioned earlier, regarding the clock pulses from the micro-controller, the corresponding response byte sent back from the card to the microcontroller should be driven by the serial clock pulses of the micro-controller. There is a chance that the response byte from the card might get skipped by the microcontroller due to the absence of a driving clock pulse. Hence it is necessary to make sure that an 8-Bit clock pulse is sent to the Card soon after the Command Frame is sent (Refer the <b>TECHNICAL NOTE </b>below). Also while receiving a Byte from the card, the DI pin (Data In) must be driven high.</p><p>Furthermore, let us analyze the different<b> types of responses</b> that we get from the card and what they mean.</p><p><img src="https://openlabpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Response_Color-1.jpg" alt="response_color" width="568" height="289"></p><p>An R1 response, 0x01 means that the command sent prior to the response has resulted in the card going into an idle state.<br>
A response byte 0x00 means that the command has been accepted and the card will be waiting for the proposed event to take place. If any other bits in an R1 response is set, it is the result of an error and it’ll be down to the factor mentioned in each R1 response bit in the figure.</p><h2>Initializing&nbsp;the SD Card</h2><p>Now, as far as sending the commands are concerned, there is an order in which they must be sent. Only the commands, CMD0, CMD1, ACMD41, CMD58 and CMD59 will be accepted when the card is in its idle state. Sending any other command will likely to yield an illegal response.</p><p><b>TECHNICAL NOTE</b>: After interfacing the card, the micro-controller must always send a set of bytes, which we will refer to as dummy bytes. One dummy byte is 0xFF. These dummy bytes have a simple yet significant purpose. Prior to the initialization, the card must know the frequency at which the data is being sent. By sending around 75 dummy bits approximately (dummy byte * 10 times = 80 bits), the card will be ready for communication. Also even after every command is sent, it is a good practice to send at least one dummy byte. A logical explanation for this is that communication is driven by the clock pulse of the micro-controller. The clock pulse is sent only when the data buffer is filled. After every response is sent and prior to the next command or between command and response, the SCK will stop generating pulses due to an empty data buffer. To ensure the continual transmission of clock pulses between every command, fill the data buffer with a junk value such as a dummy byte. To create a dummy byte function with the number of loops as the argument.</p><p>The<b> first command</b> to be sent to the card is the <b>CMD0</b> command. The structure of every other command-response should be based on this model.</p><ul><li>Drive the DO pin high.</li><li>Drive the CS pin from high to low.</li><li>Send a dummy byte.</li><li>Then send the following 6-byte command continuously<br>
First byte: 0x40<br>
Next four bytes: 0x00000000<br>
CRC byte: 0x95</li></ul><ul><li>Send another dummy byte or as many as required, to generate the SCK giving time for the SD card to respond to the command request.</li><li>Wait for the receive flag bit to set and then read the response from the SD card or create a loop to read the response a few number of times. The response should reach back within the command to response (Ncr) time. Or else, something must be wrong.</li></ul><ul><li>The desired response is 0x01, meaning the card is in the idle state and we are good to go.</li></ul><p>Send the <b>CMD8</b> command next to check the version of your SD card.<br>
The difference in the 6-byte commands are<br>
First byte: 0x48<br>
Next four bytes: 0x000001AA<br>
CRC byte: 0x87</p><p>We are looking for two possibilities in our response byte. Either 0x01 or 0x05.</p><p>A 0x01 response means that you have a version 2 SD card. The 0x01 response is followed by the 4 bytes 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0xAA in the order of their transmission from the SD card which is, in fact, the argument you send in your command.</p><p>If the response is 0x05, it means the card is a version 1 or an MMC card. If the card is actually a version 2 SD card, then this response is the result of an illegal command. Also, the card is now in the idle state.</p><p>Once the above two commands (CMD0 and CMD8) are done, it is safe to say that our SD Card is working in good condition and ready for data Read/Write.<br>
Additionally, just to ensure whether the SD Card is functioning in the correct working voltage, send the <b>CMD58</b> Command.</p><p>Next, we must initiate the i<b>nitialization</b> process. For this send a <b>CMD1</b> command and wait for response 0x00, meaning the idle state bit is cleared.<br>
If you are using an SDC or for the purpose of creating a general code, it is …</p></div></article></section></div></main></div></div></div>

We've got a lot of priorities but there's no need to stretch ourselves thin and run the risk of longer-term issues.<p>- Jean Vincent (CTO, Lytehouse)</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Unhealthy working patterns can build up over time and create longer-term issues. </p><p>In this article, we'll be showing you signs of burnout debt - and how to recognize it before it's too late.</p><p>‍</p><h3>What is 'Burnout Debt'</h3><p>Symptoms of burnout can slowly grow on a team. As sprints go on it's easy to overlook the signs that build up over time. We refer to this build up as 'burnout debt'.</p><p>You should treat burnout debt in the same way we treat technical debt. Identify it early and take measures to reduce longer-term negative effects.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Signs of 'Burnout Debt'</h3><ol role="list"><li>Unhealthy Working Patterns</li><li>High Workloads</li><li>Spikes in Weekend Activity</li></ol><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #1: &nbsp;Unhealthy Working Patterns</h3><p>One key factor in burnout is overwork. It's important we help our teams manage their workloads and reduce burnout. If your team feels the need to work late nights and weekends - it's time to have a conversation about workloads.</p><p>This team for example consistently works late nights and weekends. This is a strong signal that your team is overworking and may approach burnout. We'll see the effect of this below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593cd3ba2ac780cf72cc15_unsustainable-working-patterns.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #2: Unusually High Workloads</h3><p>Spikes in workload can be early warning signs of burnout.</p><p>The team below was under tight deadlines - working nights and weekends. You can a large spike in Throughput followed by immediate burnout which lasted ~3 months.</p><p>This is a typical situation. We take on too much work and burn out. The following weeks remain unproductive. As leaders it's our job to make sure our teams have a more sustainable, manageable workload.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593cecff346bf77d54af02_unusually-high-workload.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Sign #3: Spikes in Weekend Activity</h3><p>Large spikes in weekend activity can be an incredibly high signal for overworked. Are your current tasks too much to handle in a week? Did we poorly estimate that workload? Is the workload unmanageable?</p><p>As engineering leaders we have to protect our team from situations like that which can cause long term effects to team morale, culture, and overall productivity. As we saw in the image above, the effects of burnout can be long lasting and in some cases can lead to the highest cost for an engineering team - turnover.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed57622ee14fb96d022d544/5f593d086702304230624666_high-weekend-activity.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Is your team accumulating 'burnout debt'?</h3><p>Just like technical debt, burnout debt silently builds up in the background. As it accumulates it not only gets harder to resolve but it's impact becomes more severe.</p><p>When left unchecked 'burnout debt' impacts team culture, creates an environment of overwork, and degrades trust among the team. At an individual level it decreases satisfaction, happiness, and productivity while boiling up to team-wide frustration, low morale, and high turnover.</p><p>So.. Is your team affected by burnout debt?</p><p>‍</p><h3>What should I do about it?</h3><p>It’s important to identify these signs early so you can intervene. Luckily, there are ways to identify and resolve burnout debt.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Make it a ritual</h5><p>The first step is having conversations around workload and sustainability. Make it a recurring ritual. At Haystack we bring this up every week. We're constantly adjusting workloads and introducing new, challenging work - to combat burnout.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Get data-driven</h5><p>As engineers, we often feel productive (and happy) when we're pushing new features. There's a certain rush to grabbing a coffee, throwing on some headphones, and getting that #todo closed out - even if it takes staying up late to do it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to see or address burnout debt. In the moment, we feel great about the work we did - unknowingly allowing burnout debt to build over time. What feels great now build up in the background and soon enough you'll start feeling burnt out.</p><p>In this case, having data helps quite a bit. Being able to see trends and alert on them helps us catch burnout debt before it's too late. It also gives us a more objective picture on what our typical workload looks like so we can make sure to keep it in check.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Stop taking on 'Burnout Debt'</h3><p>If you're managing a team and you want them to be motivated, happy, and productive then burnout should be a key item to address. Just like technical debt, burnout debt can eat at teams and cause an undertone of frustration. It's not always easy to catch but if you're looking in the right direction you'll be able to spot the signs and address it before it's too late.</p><p>Of course, Haystack can help too.
